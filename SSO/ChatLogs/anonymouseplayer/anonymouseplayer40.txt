<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . . Right. . .  - Sun Dec 13 02:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was defeated.* - Sun Dec 13 02:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) got himself ready for the spar that was about to take place, slowly.  To be 100 percent, he wasn't really all that interested in this right now.  He had other things on his mind.  That would have to wait tho, he couldn't fix them right now and he needed the extra work with Geo.  Knowing that holding back was not an option against Geo, he dropped his shell.  The shell hit the ground with a solid thud and he looked at Geo with a lazy look in his eye.  Geo would easily be able to see that he was not all the way there.  Hiro was still going to go full tilt though.

Geo darted off at him full speed.  Hiro had no problem tracking him down as he ran.  None of that was ever too hard for him.  Before he knew it, there was a kick coming towards his midsection.  He quickly took a step to the side to avoid the kick completely.  Before he knew it, there were more attacks coming his way.  Geo did something that was a bit different.  He jumped up and flipped, attempting to land on his head.  Hiro was not about to have another mans junk in his face and he quckly slid under the jump.  Popping bedk up to his feet at the same time that Geo would land on his feet.  That wasn't the end of this flurry though.

Geo would then get into a football like, three-point stance.  Hiro liked a challenge and got into a stance of his own.  Matching Geo's completely.  The moment that Geo moved, he moved.  The two would charge at each other full speed ahead.  Since Geo was trying to tackle him, he attempted to truck him as if he had a football.  He lowered his shoulder, and met Geo shoulder to shoulder.  His feet continued to move through the hit.  It was pretty much a stale mate and the two bounced back away from each other.  Hiro smiled as his mind was starting to rid of the trouble he had to deal with a little later.

Now that the two were nice and warmed up, he decided to give Geo a little flurry of his own, to see how he would handle it. He charged at Geo, disappearing from sight, and threw a mighty right hook towards his left rib cage.  If he was able to land that, he would follow up with a left knee and then a front snap kick all in one swift motion.  Basically like the Cassie Cage kick thingy on Mortal Kombat X.  I know you know what I am talking about.  This spar was proably going to take a while, so might as well have some fun with it.* - Sun Dec 13 02:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) saw Geo open the first of the eight inner gates.  Hiro had been working on his stamina, so he decided to really test it out.  He unleased the first gate as well.  Just as he did it, a kick was coming towards his solarplexus.  Opening the gate gave him little time to move his body completely out of the way.  He threw his hands up in the shape of an X and let his arms take most of the damage.  He winced in pain a bit, then before he knew it, he was having his feet taken from under him.  He hit the ground with a light thud.  As he hit the ground, he noticed Geo coming in for a stomp he rolled out of the way and quickly got on his feet.  "That would have hurt."  He thinks to hismelf.

Now on his feet, he went back on the attack again.  He once again, he threw his own combination of attacks.  He charged in and threw a left side kick, aimed at his right rib cage.  Then, followed up with a solid right uppercut.  His last attack was one of those what you call, swiging for the fences type things, and he swung a powerful left straight towards Geo's chest.  * - Sun Dec 13 02:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) missed his ifirst attack, and saw Geo doing something kinda weird.  He had no idea of what he was doing.  It just loked like he was moving his body in a figure eight.  He stood there, with a confused look on his face.  He had never seen anything like it.  He tried to keep track of the punches the best that he could, but this whole thing was new to him.  He followed each and everymovemnt to the best of his ability.

The first punch came towards his chin.  He only caught wind of it towards the tail end and tried to lean back, the fist grazed his chin and he took a single step back.  The weird motions continued and another attack was coming.  He caught sight of it a bit sooner this time, but he still did not have the time to react to it.  Once again, he took a step back from the impact of being slightly caught in the chin.  "What is this?"  He thinks as he saw Geo stil rolling towards him

The attacks were still coming.  But, it was getting a bit easier with each of the punches that wer coming.  He was even starting to get a read on the pattern of which Geo was moving.  The thrid punch came towards him and he sheilded himself with both arms, keeping the damage down to a minimum on his chin.  He couldn't take even another graze to his chin, Geo hit too damn hard.

The final punch came Hiro's way and he once again tried to avoide it.  He leaned back and the fist barely missed his chin.  He stumbled backwards from the avoidance and looked at Geo, he was in no shape to return an attack right now, he just had to try and deal with Geo's next attack.* - Sun Dec 13 03:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was watching Geo carefully as he activated the second of the eight inner gates.  Then, he saw Geo pull his fist back as if he was going to punch him from there.  Thoguths filled his head as he tried to figure out why Geo would be trying to punch him from that distance.   "Why the hell is he trying to punch me from back there?  Oh shit. . Is that the?  Uh oh. . Gotta move.  I cannot be in line with his fist when he punches."

He darted off towards the left, moving faster then hopefully Geo could follow.  As he moved, the punch was thrown and a crater was left in the earth.  He continued to run around Geo as he spoke.  "Whoa there Geo.  That one might have done some real damage.  I thought this was just a spar?"  He would continue to run circles around Geo, awaiting an answer.* - Sun Dec 13 03:21:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) arrives to a very familiar area and smiles as he looks around.  This place had a bunch of value to him, a lot of things had happened here.

"It's funny you would choose this spot to train.  A lot of things have happened between us here."  He would say with a laugh.* - Sun Dec 13 19:30:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I have been working on getting my own style of fighting. - Sun Dec 13 19:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Much like your Kung-fu thing. - Sun Dec 13 19:34:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) took off his shell and placed it over beside the rock.  He walked back to his starting positoin, stretching a bit.  He would then close his eyes, and take a deep breath.  He opened his eyes and started to rock back and forth.  This was probably something that Kinami had never seen before.  As he rocked, his body stayed in constant motion.  His arms moving from side to side, covering his face occasionally for protection as he rocked.  He smiled at her. "Here I come."

He darted off, his new style of fighting increasing his overall speed.  Once he got close, he would throw his left leg up, from his Ginga.  His leg would go up and over her, hoping to catch her off guard with the feint.  As soon as that foot hit the ground, it would pop back up and throw deliver a solid roundhose to her temple.  Each of the motions were very quick, and fluid.  Regardless of if he hit her, he would go back to his Ginga, staying in constant motion.* - Sun Dec 13 19:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) wsa met half way in his sprint.  As the two met, she would attempt to send a kick underneath him, to knock him off balance.  With his new fighting style, that was not all that much of a problem.  He let her tacke his feet from under him, placing both hands on the ground, balancing himself.  Hoping to catch her slipping, he lifted his left hand off of the ground and used only his right for support, as he lleaned in and attempted to drop his left foot directly on the top of Kinami's head.  * - Sun Dec 13 20:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had missed and landed back onto the ground, in his Ginga once again.  He had to stay in constant motion to make this style of fighting work.  He smiled as she rolled backwards to avoid the attack.  "She seems to get better and better each time we fight. . . I love it!"  He thinks to himself.  His thoughts were quickly intturupted as she was coming back for yet another attack.

A punch came towards the boy, at a high speed.  If his eyes were not sharp, and his body was not already in constant motion, he would not have even had a chance to even think about dodging.  This knew stlye was really coming in handy at a time like this.  As the punch came, he performed what was called an Esquiva, simply meaning an escape or a dodge.  This was not a simple Esquiva, this was an Esquiva Diagonal.  This particular Esquiva allowed him to dodge and advance simultaneously.  Instead of goigni straigh down, under her attack, he moved to the diagonal right of her.  He placed his front foot perpendicular from his back foot and crouched down, performing a low lunge.  His left arm shot up and protected his face, as his right was used to maintian his balance.  Now that the dodge was out of the way, time for the attack.

Now, hopefully inside of her defenses, he prepared an attack.  Since he was close to here and his left arm was already close to her, he threw a quick elbow towards her gut, hoping to knock a little air out of her.  This attack came quick, and hard.  Trying to cause some sort of damage.* - Sun Dec 13 20:29:36 2015
