<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Let's roll. - Wed Nov 18 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Out here, behind the houses, works pretty well. - Wed Nov 18 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Ladies first. - Wed Nov 18 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was already in his usual fighting stance by the time he told her Ladies first.  This was a good thing because Mitsu waisted no time coming at him, with a sword in hand none the less.  

"Why does it seem like I only fight people with swords?  O well, I wanted to spar and I got what I wanted."  He thinks to himself.

Hiro would immediately react with a swift duck.  She was fast, but not faster then he was.  Still, he cut it kind of close.  As he ducked under the blade a few of his longer hairs were sliced off.  This was a small price to pay.  He was pretty sure that Mitsu wasn't oing for anything lethal anyway.  As he ducked, he fluidly leaned backwards and placed his hand onto the ground to support his body weight.  As he did this he quickly threw a solid left kick aimed towards the arm with the sword in it.  This was meant to throw the hand up with the sword and open her up for a follow up.  * - Wed Nov 18 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) connected with his kick, but this left him open.  As soon as his kick connected her arm flew upswards, as he wanted.  But she seemed to laugh off the attack and grab his ankle with her other hand.  "Shit."  He would say as he was thrown towards a cactus.  She had a lot more strength then he expected, so he flew towards the cactus with more force then he could do much with.  He woul dhit the cactus and get stabbed by several umm. . Prickly thingies.  The cactus would be torn in half and hit the ground just infrond of him.  His entired left side was covered in these little spinny thingies from this cactus.  "Shit this hurts. . . I have to ge these things out quickly if I want to have a chance."  He started by going for the ones on his left leg.  There were about 7 in his leg alone, but he had quick hands.  He kept his eyes on Misu as he quickly disposed of the seven prickles in his leg.  As they came out, each one would leave a small hole in his pants and some blood would be visible on his shoes from it running down his leg.  His movements had indeed been slowed from this event, but he could still move around pretty well.  "Hehehe, I got careless.  Can't do that again."  He would state as prepared for her next attack with only one arm completely useable.  The other had 7 prickles in it and he wasn't sure if he had the time to pull them out just yet.* - Wed Nov 18 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled at her and started to pick the rest of the prickles out of his arm.

"My aren't you a little sweetheart?"  He would say with a sly smile.  He finished picking the last one out of his arm and wiggled both his arm and his leg.  Both were still in pretty good shape.  Not 100%, but pretty good shape.  "Here I come."

He would dash off towards her at an amazing speed.  There weren't many people he knew that were faster then him and that was something that he was proud of.  Once he got in range he would quickly throw a right roundhouse kick aimed at her left cheek.  This was more of a feint then anything else.  But if it hit, it would not be weaker at all.  This kick would be followed up with a quick, fluid spin into a sweeping low left kick aiming to take her feet out from under her.  He would finish with one final quick spin and a right side kick to her midsection aiming to send her sliding along the sandy surface of Sunagakure.* - Wed Nov 18 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Fast... - Wed Nov 18 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was indeed not going to continue an attack to trade blows with her while she had a katana.  He immediately stopped his initail kick and jumped back and to the left a little to avoid the strike from her Katana.  

"Nice."  He would think to himself as he smiled at her.  He was having a lot of fun.  She was the first person that he had ever had the chance to spar that he coul dactually hit and not worry about causing her too much pain.  He was loving every minute of this. 

As soon as his feet hit the ground he reached into his infinite IOG pouch and pulled out a single kunai.  He figured that the Katana was a lot stronger then his single Kunai, but he figured it would at leas help.  He would then once again charge towards her.  Watching her every movement, trying to keep himself prepared for anything that she did.  When he got within range, he would throw a single right hook aimed towards her left rib cage.  He wasn't the kind of guy to hit a girl in the face, even if it was a spar.* - Wed Nov 18 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) connected with his strike, but once agian Mitsu was a resiliant foe.  As he connected she sent a slash towards his shoulder.  Him knowing his speed advantage wouldn't think to much of it.  He simply attemtped to jump out of the way.  As he started to jump he felt something grab his hand, she got his ass again.  "O shit."  He would then get slashed on his shoulder and his jacket, along with his shirt underneath.  Blood would stain his entire Jacket sleeve from his blood leaking out of his shoulder.  He smiled at her and calmly stated.

"If that is not your real sword, I don't want to see that thing.  But I would like to see you going all out.  Be a sweetheart and take it out.  I will wait."

He stood there not attempting to release himself from her grip or anything.  Just standing there smiling keeping a close eye on her, while trying to keep his mind off of his throbbing shoulder.* - Wed Nov 18 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) 's smile would be met with a headbutt.  He wasn't going to try and move.  She kept on taking his hits, so he was going to take hers as well.  Even if it wasn't the smartest idea.  His head went back and he looked into the sky.  He caught himself by moving his left foot back and quickly stabilizing himself.  He looked back at her and wiped the blood dripping from his nose, smiling.  As he looked at her he noticed her swaying with his great vision.  "She might actually be hurting. . . So she isn't invulnerable."  He thinks to himself.  He slowly got into his fighting stance one again.  His feet staggered, left infront of the right.  His body turned slightly to the right and his fist clinched tightly around chin level.  

"Nice sword you go there.  Come whenever you are ready."  He would say as he gives her the come on gesture with his hand.* - Wed Nov 18 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Wait did she just call me darlin? - Wed Nov 18 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) quickly jumped back and tucked into a ball.  He flipped around quickly and landed on his feet, sliding along the surface.

"Wow, fire.  Can't let that touch me.  I can't take the heat."  He would think to himself.

Knowing now that she was serious it would be harder to just run in and throw wild attacks.  He actually tried to plan out his next move.  Something that he doesn't usually do, but was fully capable of.  He used his speed to his advantage and ran to her left side.  He quickly spun around and threw a sweeping left kick aiming to knock her off of her feet.  If he was able to do that he would follow up with a knee aimed directly into the left half of her back.  This, he hoped, would cause enough damage to her for him to actually see the results of his attack.* - Wed Nov 18 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had little time to react.  This girl was something else.  He quickly attempted to move out of the way.  He was close, but that only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.  He was hit in the side by the flaming blade and sent sliding back.  He refused to fall, simply because she didn't.  It didn't work.  He lost his footing and fell to his back and rolled over onto his feet.  His shirt and jacket now had a whole in it from the flames burning them.  He grabbed his side in visible pain, but he still managed to smile through the pain.  "You have an answer for everything don't you?"  He would say as he quickly, well as quickly as he could, ran back at her.  Clearly his combinations were not going to work, so he had to throw one solid attack at a time.  He leaped into the air, kunai still in hand, and threw a mighty jump kick aimed at her chest.  This was turning into a slugfest and he was loving everyminute of it.  Still, he knew he could not be taking many more hits from her even if he was enjoying himself.* - Wed Nov 18 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) kick landed, but once again she had an answer.  Her movements had indeed messed him up, but he recoverd as soon as he hit the ground.  The moment he looked back at her the blade was coming at him again.  This was starting to become a recurring theme.  He was exhausted.  He was soaked in sweat, his cloathes were sticking to him, and he was having trouble just focusing on the blade coming at him.  He rolled to his left, but was still cut on the side from not being fast enough.  He rolled right up onto a single knee.  HE smiled at her and started to speak.

"You are right.  I forfeit, you win.  I had a blast sparring you though.  We have to do this again sometime Mitsu."  After he said this he would let himself fall onto his back and spread out. 

 "I think I am just going to lay here for a second.  I am tired as shit."* - Wed Nov 18 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) gives a weak laugh.

"You are a tough little lady aren't you?  Pretty and tough.  One hell of a combination you got going on there Mitsu."  * - Wed Nov 18 05:45:36 2015

"I don't even know what they have here. . . . How about I just eat whatever you eat?  Maybe I will get tougher."* - Wed Nov 18 05:53:16 2015

Maybe  he was a little over confident in his speed, but until he was proven other wise he would keep his confidence.

"As expected of you Mr. Mizu."

He would quickly recover and attempt to go back at him again.  He starts off with a high kick, that he hoped would catch the focus of the Mizukage.  He then spins and fluently throws a sweeping kick to try and knock him off of his feet.
