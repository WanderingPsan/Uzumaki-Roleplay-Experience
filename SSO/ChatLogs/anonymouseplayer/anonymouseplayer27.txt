<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) put on his teacher hat once again and started to explain the steps as he performed them.

"Ok Green.  This technique is called Suimen.  Not only will it allow you to walk up this wall like I just said, you will also be able to walk on water.  This technique requires very delacated chakra control.  So you have to focus, or you will fall off of the wall.  The first thing you are going to do for me iis try to concentrate your chakra into the soles of your feet.  Be carful not to use too much or too little.  If you use too much, you will just fall off of the wall to the ground.  If you use too much, you will off of the wall.  You have to find the right amount and be able to maintain it."  HIroshi would then start to scale the wall simply by walking up its side.  He would look down, parallel to the ground and continue to talk to Green.

"Ok, start by trying to channel your chakra into your feet and maintaining it for about a minute or so. "* - Wed Dec  2 23:51:02 2015

Also since it would be impossible for Mirai to accept otherwise, I'm giving her and Sanoke special seats that way she can dress as the maid to serve Sanoke alone.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) darted off of the wall and caught his brother before he hit the ground.  He hit the grond once, that was enough.  He placed him back onto his own two feet and placed his hand onto his head.  He squatted and got eye level with him.

"Look, just relax.  You are doing fine.  Just take your time.  You are too worried about falling.  I will stand on the ground and make sure I catch if you fall.  I'm your brother, thats what I am here for."  He then starts to move his hand side to side on Green's head, messing up his hair a bit.

"Now try it again.  You got this."* - Thu Dec  3 00:25:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) kept a sharp eye on Momu.  Watching her everymove as she approached him in a zig-zagging fashion.  She dipped and threw a mighty elbow towards his lower-stomach.  She was already lower then he was from the dip, so he tried to use this to his advantage.  He quickly took a single step to his right, avoiding the elbow.  While side-stepping, he threw a solid left knee aimed at her stomach. He could not remember exactly how strong Momu was, so in an effort not to harm her too badly, if he even made contact, he threw this knee at around half power.* - Thu Dec  3 01:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had been a little too lax in his delivery.  Her body basically laughed at him due to his attack being nothing more then a simple tickle to her.  Before he knew it, he was getting grabbed and swung around.  Everything was spinning so fast that it was all looking like one single musshed up picture.  He looked to his right and noticed the rock coming up at a high speed  He brought up his arms and braced himself for the impact.  Surprisingly, it didn't hurt him all that much.  When he realized that the pain was not coming, he quickly jumped into action.  

He used the rock as a base for his attack.  His hands firmly on the rock, and her holding on to his foot, he used his free goot to try and deliver a swift kick to her left shoulder.  He put more strength behind this one then he had the previous one.  He wanted to basically give her a stinger. 

As he was about to deliver the kick, he heard Marco and immediately stopped.  He sat there with Momu holding his foot and him hands on the rock.

"Ohh they are?  Momu, let me go."* - Thu Dec  3 01:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was dropped instatly, he won't ready.* - Thu Dec  3 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had been around her long enough to know what that leg movement meant.  He stepped to the side and watched the sand fly from her mighty kick.  He didn't call her Miss Supa Kick for nothing.  He smiled at her and shook his head.

"Nope, not like that.  You going to have to work for this one."* - Thu Dec  3 04:29:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was still focussing on Kinami as she came at him.  As far as he could remember he was faster then her attack speed wise, but things change.  Oh, how they change.  This was the fastest fist he had ever seen flying at him.  He was caught off guard and tried to react, he was too slow.  The fist connected with his nose and everything started to spin.  He was in a bad spot already.  Not being able to see straight was not going to stop him from trying though.  He threw a punch, that she probably wouldn't even have to dodge.  He was seeing triple at this point.* - Thu Dec  3 04:33:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: For sure. - Thu Dec  3 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had let his mouth get him into a spot where his ass couldn't cover him.  With things still spinning, and the single Kinami that he swung at being nothing more then a fake.  He saw all three of them come towards him.  He tried to move, but he was too far gone.  He felt himself stumble, only to be grabed and dropped onto the ground.  Then a knee dropped onto his chest pinning him down.  This might have been something he could have tried to work his way out of, even if the effort was going to be futile.  But, with the multiple Nami's he saw on top of him, he had no chance.  He just smiled at all three and started to speak.

"You got faster."* - Thu Dec  3 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: So many Nami's. . . .  - Thu Dec  3 04:40:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) then realized the exact position he was in on the ground.  With Nami still on top of him he would give her a sly smile.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) watches the on coming spar like a hawk.  With all of his mind, he focused on the fight.  Trying to gain a better understanding of Geo's fighting style.  For right now, he wasn't doing all that much, but he was damn sure capable of so much more.  This was going to be a very interesting fighting style to analyze.* - Thu Dec  3 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had seen this stance from Kinami multiple times, but he had not really tried to focus on the lagistics of it.  He was going to try and get all that in right now.  He wasn't fighting, so he had all the time to focus intentely on the way she moved, the way she attacked, everything about this fighting style.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was tired of all the shit he had taken today and decided that he was gong to train, now.  He would keep an eye on the wpar, but he was going to get imself stronger while he did so.  He took off his jacket and shirt and flded them neatly.  He placed them off to the side and lowered himelf to the ground.  He would look over at Green and basically command his bro.  Green would immediately recognize the seriousness in his tone.  

"Sit on my back now!  I am going to use you as extra weight."  He sat there in push up position, awaiting Green's answer.* - Thu Dec  3 05:46:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) , now with Green on his back, began to lower himself to the ground.  Slowly, his arms started to bend, slowly getting to a 90 degree angle.  He kept on going, until the tip of his nose touched the sandy surface of the training area.  At that point, he would start to push against the earth.  His body started to rise up once again.  His arms going from the previous 90 degree angle, back to the 180 degree line.  He had reached the top and was waiting for Green to count.  He looked at the spar with an expression of pure determination.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) then repeated the process.  Green had did his job and he was going to do his part.  His mind totally focused on his own new found inspiration to get stronger.

"I am going to get stronger.  No more slacking.  Not only did I lose a bet that I suggested.  Then this Geo, bowl cut havin, green jump suit so tight his damn nipples looke like they trying to break through to the other side.  This bastard. . I swear.  I am not going to let this shit fly.  I haven't felt like this in a while.  I am sorry Sae, Mari, I have failed both of you and I won't let it happen anymore."  At this point he had reached the climax of his push up.  Awaiting to hear his brother count.* - Thu Dec  3 05:57:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had no time for cake and games.  He was still to focused.  Glaring at the spar as he started to go sown once again.  The weight of his borther on his back to try and make this an even harder exercise.  The signs of his work were starting to show.  His face started to glisten slightly from sweat starting to form.  He was not tired, just starting to warm up.  To make this even more effective, he sloed down the pace at which he was going down.  He looked as if he was just sitting there, unless you actually watched him perform this push-up entirely.  He hit the point where he was just above the ground and held that position for now, his eyes never moving from the spar.

". . . "* - Thu Dec  3 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) watching the spar, everything happening in slow motion.  Watching every move with extreme profficiency.  He was still holding that position, he needed to get back to the starting point so he could repeat.  He pushed against the ground, trying to move it down into itself.  He ws not that strong, so instead he started to rise, slowly.  He ws still trying to make each one the best that he could.  AS he did so he started to mumble to himself.  Green might be able to make out what he is saying.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) started to lower himself to the ground again.  Sweat dripping from his forehead.  He was livid.  He was so angry he didn't know how to contain himself.  This entire situation was pissing him off.  The more he watched the spar, the madder he got.  He started to do machine gun like push ups.  Moving up and down at an alarming pace.  He was going so fast in fact, that Green might start to lose his balance.  Hiroshi wasn't focused on that for now, he just kept on going.  Forgetting about his Bro.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) continued to do his rapid fire push ups.  Seemed like Green was doing a good job holding on.  So the lack of concern for Green was even more prevalent now.  His body moving up and down at a break neck pace.  He was still trying to release the pint up energy that he had coursing through the fiber of his being.  He was going as fast as he could., but he tried to increase the speed of it anyway.  He was doing push ups at a pace he had never thought he could.  Anger was one hell of a drug.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) rose to his feet and wiped his forhead.  He was not done with all of the things that he was going to do.  He was determined that as long as they were sparring, he was going to keep training.  He placed his hands on the back of his head, hie fingers interlocking with each other around the back of his head.  He placed his feet shoulder width apart and started to lower himself to a sitting position.  The muscles in his legs all contracting as he went down.  He continued to go down as slow as possible, maximizing the effect of the jutsu.

Reached a full blown sitting position.  It looked like he was sitting in an imagionary chair.  This position would not be held for long.  He started to rise up again.  His muscles re-expanding as he went back up into his normal standing position.  At that point he would start to raise to his tippie toes.  Performing a calf raise.  His calfs buldging as he did so.

He looked over at Trill and nodded his head.  He still had the same angry expression on his face that he had had the entire time.  He would not say anything, just nod.  Even though he spoke, he continued to train.  He leaped  up into the air and performed a simple tuck jump.  He landed and started to repeat this entire process.* - Thu Dec  3 06:39:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had forgotten that he was training do to his irl short ass attentions span, but he was back on his shit now.  He had rested a while and felt brand new.  so he would not hold anything back as he training.  With everything still in the same position, he lowered himself down to the ground again.  His knees bending until he was sitting in a chair, an imagionary one that is.  He held this position.  His muscles on fire inside of his legs.

When he finally reached the point that he could not take squating ehre anymore, he started to rise, slowly.  The soles of his feet pushing against the solses of his shoes.  Which is pushing against the earth.  He got back to the upright postion and lifeted his heels off of the ground.  He went up until only his toes were on the ground.  This calf raise set them jokers on fire, but he was already heated, so it was ok.

He place his feet flat on the ground and then leapt into the air.  He brought his knees up to his chest, while still in the air.  He brought his feet back down with a stomp and dipped himself until his hands dragged along the ground.  He scooped up some sand and stood straight up.  He then releaed the sand from his hands, slowly watching each grain falling back to the earth.* - Thu Dec  3 07:07:56 2015
