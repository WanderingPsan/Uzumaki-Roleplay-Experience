<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) darted off towards Izanami without further hesitation.  She might have only been 7 years old or so, but Hiro knew all to well of her talent.  He really had to work for this one.  Personally, he wsn't sure how this was goign to work out.  He continued to run until he was within striking range.  He stared off with a simple combination of kicks, trying to overwhelm her with the combo.

  He would start off with a mighty left roundhouse kick aimed at her right cheek.  He was hoping that he would get her to focus on this kick.  In one swift, fluid motion, he would throw a sweeping left kick aimed at her ankles, attempting to knock her off of her feet.  He would finish the combo with a simple push kick to send her a decent distance away from him.* - Sun Dec  6 05:53:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was very strong physically, but he did not put enough into the strike the shatter the sword.  He would curse at himself silentely for not putting everything he had into the attack.  Keeping his eyes locked on Izanami the entire time.  Before he knew it, she was tring to kick him in the jaw.  He brought up his left hand to knock away the kick.  He would then use his free right hand to send a swift elbow aimed directly at her chest.

That was ok though, it was about time for him to turn up the tempo a little bit.  Before he could do that, there were three shuriken flying his way, quickly and well thrown.  She had better aim then most people throwing a simple shuriken.  He smiled and clapped his hands.  A gust of wind surrunded him, sheilding him from all three of the shuriken.  He smiled, thinking back on the first spar he had with Iza.  Seemed like things hadn't changed all that much.  
When the shuriken hit the ground, they would be followed by the weight on Hiro's back.  He felt light as a feather now.  Things were about to heat up.* - Sun Dec  6 06:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled at Iza as he saw her use her mouth instead of an arm.  He was happy to see that she was finding ways to compensate for the loss of an arm.  That didn't mean that he was going to take it easy on her.  He decided to try a brand knew approach.  He reached into his pouch and pulled out a single smoke bomb.  He threw the bomb in front of Iza, trying to blind her with the smoke.  As soon as the smoke hit the ground and spread around, he slipped into the earths surface.  He couldn't see Iza in the smoke anyway, but he could feel where she was on the surface for now.  He darted towards her for now, underground.* - Sun Dec  6 06:28:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled as Iza was right there with him underground.  Seemed like everytime he went under the ground, somebody else came in after him.  It was ok, he didn't plan on staying down there too long anyway.  He charged at Iza, clinchin his left fist tightly as he appoached.  As he got within range of her.  He would swing his entire body into a solid uppercut delivered to her chin.  He was trying to drive both of them up and out of the ground, if that was indeed possible.* - Sun Dec  6 06:35:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not able to make it to Iza, but before he knew it, there was a heat coming towards him that he did not recognize.  It was hard to make out exactly what it was, but he kenw it wasn't anything good.  He attempted to resurface, quickly.  He could not completely escape the ball of flames and was hit on his right foot.  He resurfaced, holding on to his leg, on one knee.  It didn't hurt him too bad, but he felt it.  He noticed Izanami flipping in the air, attempting to stick the landing.  He was not going to have any of that.  

He put up two seals.  Ram! Tiger!  He would then spit out a sticky, starchy substance from his mouth, directly in the place that Izanami was about to land.  Hoping to leave her stuck in that spot.* - Sun Dec  6 06:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would smile again.  Seemed like Iza had a few tricks left up her sleeve.  He saw her throw the kunai and prepared himself for the attack.  Then, she used the move he recalled in the previous round of the chuunins.  He knew that nothing good could come from something like that.  He put up a single Tiger! seal and poofed away.  Not wanting to deal with Iza moving that fast.  He reappeard over behind his own trap.  Not in the trap, just behind it for now.  He smiled at Iza and called out to her.

"You always seem to have an answer don't you?"  He would say with a smile as he redied himself for the continuation of this battle.* - Sun Dec  6 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Damn. . Thought I had her. - Sun Dec  6 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would go back to the battle.  There was no time for idle chit-chat.  He reached into his pouch and pulled out 4 shuriken.  He aimed them for both legs and both a-. . .I mean both legs, her arm, and her shoulder.  While they were flying through the air, he would quicky perform three seals.  Dog! Rabbit! Snake! after the final seal a mighty gust of wind would come from behind her.  Not only was it strong enough to knock Iza over unless she did something about it.  It also increased the speed of which the shuriken were flying at her.  Making them go much faster then Hiro could ever throw them.  He stood their, seeing what was going to happen from this attack.* - Sun Dec  6 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: They found it faster than I thought. - Sun Dec  6 07:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had failed again.  But, something else caught his eye.  He noticed that Iza's eyes had changed colors for only a second.  He wasn't sure what the hell it was, but he knew he wasn't going to have time to do anything about it right now.  Before he knew it, she was flying past him again.  He watched her everymove as she whizzed past him.  Blowing his hair and clothes around as she went by.  He turned around to see a shape that looked like something that he had saw previously.  He knew it was fire, but was it the same thing that had came at him underground?  He had no idea.  He had an idea though.

Since this was supposed to be a showcase of what he could do, he figured he do something that he wouldn't usually do.  He just hoped that it worked.  He ran through a set of seals and then shot out a pressure-filled stream of water at the flames.  He was hoping to stop the explosion from harming him at all, if that was possible.  If he was able to do so, he would stand there not moving, he knew of his own trap behind him.* - Sun Dec  6 07:12:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) kept his eyes focused on Izanami.  She was extremely fast, and she seemed to have so many different things up her sleeve.  Before he knew it, she was on his side, sending a torent of flames at him.  He had little time, he needed to try and move, but he wasn't sure if he was going to make it, even with his impressive speed.  He darted off to the left and performed a mighty dive, trying to get away from the flames.  He was caught on his leg and the pain of being burnt started to take effect.  He pat his foot on the ground, trying to get the flames off of it.  

"HOT!!!!"* - Sun Dec  6 07:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) finally got the flames out from his foot andcontinued to focus on Iza.  She was still moving around using that weird propulsion thingy.  He didn't know what exactly what it was, but he was not too concerned.  Iza was coming at him again, with a punch this time.  He didn't have the time to move, and he knew it.  He accepted the fact that he was going to get hit and just hoped that he was goign to be able to take it.  Knowing that he was goign to get hit, he attempted to trade blows with her.

The fist would connect with his face.  He was not sure of the strength, so he could not really say if he was able to just take the damage or not.  But, the instant her fist connected with his face, his knee would connect into her stomach.  He was attempting to cause some decisive damage in this spar, if he was indeed able to hit her that was.* - Sun Dec  6 07:30:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not able to just take this punch and laugh at it.  He was indeed hurt from this blow, the knee that he was about to throw, not going to be able to reach her.  But, Hiro was the kind of guy to rrefuse to give up.  Having extreme control over his body, he would attempt to extend his foot and deliver a kick.  This kick would be considerably weaker, and possibly not even make sontact with her as she hit him.  He just hoped for the best.

He fell onto his back and attempted to pop up to his feet.  He couldn't do it, he was a bit dazed.  He could only manage to get to his knee.  But, even that was a struggle.  The punch made his nose swell up instantly as blood started to run down his face.  He was so dazed, that he saw two Izanamis.  He chuckled to himself as he shook his head trying to get the cobwebs out.  "Damn. . . There are two of her."  He thinks to hismelf.* - Sun Dec  6 07:40:48 2015

A single tear rolled down his face, as he thought about his mother.  He missed her so much.  His arms both started to lift as if someone was pulling him up.  He could actually feel something behind him, pulling him up.  He knew immediately what it was.  He struggled to stand, blood running out of the left nostril of his swollen nose.  The single tear would reach his chin and fall to the ground.  He would wipe his face and slowly bring his hands up into his fighting stance.  He was too tired to move right now, he was not completely recovered.  But he was standing up now, thanks to the help from his mom.  He looked at Iza and started to speak.

"No . . I have to win this Iza. . . I have too. . For her. . . She was on the way to work back home, just like any other normal day.  Just as she got to the store that she had worked at for so many years.  Three random men ran out of the shop and saw her.  She saw one of their faces as they carried a bag of money with them.  They ran past her and sliced her in the side of her neck with no remorse. .I have to become a chuunin. . . For my mom Iza. . . For her."  He would stand there, determination filling his eyes.* - Sun Dec  6 07:53:36 2015
