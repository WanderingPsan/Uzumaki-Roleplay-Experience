<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was enjoying himself to much to stop now.  Even if it did have some repercussions.  He continued to laugh as he spoke.

"What's wrong now Hatsu?  You mad that I am right?"* - Thu Nov 19 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was actually pretty happy to hear him say something about that song once again.  He started to nod his head to signify that Hatsu was right.  As he started to listen he heard a single string pluch and sound a note.  Hiroshi closed his eyes and thought silently to himself.  "Ahhh soothing."  Then out of nowhere he felt himself being wrapped up by something, he just didn't know what it was yet since his eyes were closed. 

"What the hell?  I thought I was listneing to a song?"

Hiro looked down and saw several guitar strings wraping around his body.  Then suddenly he started to feel dizzy.  He felt all of his balance leave him at once and he fell straight to his bottom.  He sat there trying to collect himself the best he could.  He was totally trapped in this genjutsu.* - Thu Nov 19 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) snapped back into reality and looked around puzzled.  He wasn't sure what hte hell just happened.  He patted himself down with both hands and wiggled his legs.  He passed his little self check and looked around until he spotted Hatsu.

"What the hell was that?  I though you were finally going to play a song?  I know you did that shit."* - Thu Nov 19 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm? What do you mean? - Thu Nov 19 07:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Nah man, you did. - Thu Nov 19 07:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: You just mad cause I was right.  *sticks out toungue* - Thu Nov 19 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Fight me then. - Thu Nov 19 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Bring it. - Thu Nov 19 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Nah man I don't want to hurt you any more then I already did. - Thu Nov 19 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Pansie bitch. - Thu Nov 19 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Paper ass pussy. - Thu Nov 19 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) squints back at him 

"You asked."  He would say with a demonic smile.  Hedarted off at full speed and when he got within range he brought both of his hands up to around chest level.  HIs left hand open, palm facing up.  His right hand balled into a fist, cupped into his left.

"Rock.  Paper. Scissors.  Shoot."  He would exclaim.* - Thu Nov 19 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) gets slapped in the face, but it didn't hurt.  He wasn't sure why but it didn't hurt.  His face didn't even move.  He just stood there with complete shock on his face.  He then errupted into laughter.

"What the hell was that?  O well.  Clearly you didn't want this beatdown in Rock. Paper. Scissors.  Pussy. . . . "  He would say as he continued to laugh.* - Thu Nov 19 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: I don't know if I made a friend of an enemy today. . . Fuck it. - Thu Nov 19 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not fitting to get put in another genjutsu if he could do anything about it.  Since he was actually going throught he motions of the game with him, Hiro was staring intentely at Hatsu's hand.  The moment he did something other then a sign from the game he would quickly shoot his hand forward and grab hold of Hatsu's with very little strength.  He didn't want to be breaking his fingers and shit.  He hoped that his sudden movements would catch Hatsu off guard and stop him from being able to cast the genjutsu.  If that was successful he would smile and start to speak.

"No no no.  Not again.  I don't like genjutsu buddy."

If for any reason that he could not have stopped him from being able to cast the genjutsu do not worry about the top half of this and just go with this section.

Hiroshi was in a happy little game of Rock. Paper. Scissors.  Or so he thought.  He was watching Hatsu closely as they played, preparing to win this game.  He was extremely confident in his abilities to play this game since he played it all of the time when he was younger.  As they were about to make the final sign, Hatsu changed the game and put up a seal.  "Shit."  HIro tried to stop him but was not fast enough.  He would be caught in yet another Genjutsu and not be happy about it.  "What the hell is this one?"  He would then feel heat.  More heat then usual.  He looked up and saw a giant fireball coming down right towards him.  He paniced and tried to run.  He ran as far as he could, but it seemed like the fireball had a homing devise.  He fell as he was looking up and slid on the sand.  He rolled over and looked towards the fireball in horror.  "This is bad. . .Where did it even come from?"* - Thu Nov 19 08:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: strength plus tai is 47.2 - Thu Nov 19 08:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looked down at his wrist and started to take note of the brusing on it.  

"Damn. . This guy really is made of paper. . . "  He would think to himself  As he was thinking he saw Hatsu start to try again with his other hand.  Once again he grabbed it, but with his other hand and a little lighter this time.  He really wasn't trying to hurt him.  He would look at Hatsu directly in the eyes and start to speak.

"You are a feisty one aren't you?  Look I will tell you now.  Just relax bro.  I just wanted to play some Rock Paper Scissors.  Not get caught in a series of Genjutsu.  One was enough.  I see what you can do and honestly. . .It freaks me the fuck out.  But you seem to be a nice guy and I am trying not to hurt you.  Even now I see that your wrist is bruising.  What are you made of?  Papar skin and glass bones?  Like I ain't even putting much pressure on the grip.  But, I will let you go as soon as you agree to not try and put me in a genjutsu.  Sound fair?"* - Thu Nov 19 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) gave him a very stupid look.  Then out of nowhere he saw him bite his lip and spit blood at him.  He ducked, without letting go of Hatsu's wrists and then resuming his look of stupidity at Hatsu.

"Why are you trying so hard?  And how am I a pedophile if I am only 13.  Plus I don't want you.  You don't have boobs, you are a guy.  What the hell is wrong with you man?"* - Thu Nov 19 08:34:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) let's go and starts to rub his hands in the dirt.  He was appauled.  He was not going to be a part of whatever creepy ass things Hatsu had going on with his life.  He started to speak extremely fast as he frantically rubbed the sand.

"AAAAAHHHHHHH.  WHAT THE FUCK?  AND YOU CALLE DME A PEDOPHILE?  YOU CREEPY BASTARD.  STAY AWAY FROM ME.  YOU CAN'T HAVE MY BOOTY."  He would yell.  He then noticed Kuro from the Hungry ant.
