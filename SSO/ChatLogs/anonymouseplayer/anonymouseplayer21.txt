<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had watched Kinami spar a few times and knew a little about what she could do.  He wasn't 100% on everything she could do.  But, since he was distracted by Chikyu, by the time he turned around she was already ontop of him.  He had no time to react and was punched in the nose.  It didn't hurt him at all.  He just smiled at Nami and started to speak.  

"You must be holding back. Don't worry. I can take a hit hun.  Now it is my turn.  Get ready."  

He also did not know the full capabilities of her defenses so he was not going to be going full strength either.  Actually he matched her strength to the best of her ability.  Quickly he slapped her hand away from his face and then leaped into the air quickly delivering a kick aimed at her chest.  Once again he was only useing the same amount of strength that she had used on him. . . Testing her as she did him.* - Sat Nov 28 05:41:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) kick had done a little something.  So he was getting a feel of what he was going to be able to do and what he wasn't goign to be able to do.  While he was tinking of a second attack he saw a fist flying at his chest.  He was in a bad spot so moving was out of the question.  He took the punch to the chest and smiled again.  His rock solid chest felt nothing from the punch.  Then a kick came at him.  It was a bit stronger then the punch and did very minimal damage.  He stood there as she flipped smiling.  She was upping the anty on him.

"Alright Nami.  You want me to do better?  Let's see how you take this one."

He charged at her and then threw a solid right roundhouse kick aimed at her left cheek.  Hopefully, while she was focused on the high kick he performed a quick spin and aimed to take her feet out from under her completely.  He would end his little combination by how she was affected by the sweep.  If he was able to sweep her, he would spin and then shoot his right leg up like a rocket into her back to send her high into the air.  Leaving her open for another attack hopefully.  If he was not able to sweep her, he simply did a push kick aiming to push her back if he could.* - Sat Nov 28 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not able to keep up with her physically.  But his sight was like extremely good.  He had no trouble keeping up with her movements with his eyes.  He smiled upon her telling him to be faster.  He was having fun.  He indeed turned around upon hearing her whisper.  But with his sight, seeing her was no issue at all.  As she sent the kick to his knee he quickly picked up his foot to kick hers away.  Then with his other foot he quickly jumpe up and delivered a solid kick to her chest, before she had a chance to react.  He was hoping she undersetimated his ability to see her and would be surprised that he could see her attacks coming.  If his kick landed he would push off, flip, and spin.  Landing on the ground sliding looking at her.  He woudl get back in his stance and extend a hand towards her.  He would then give her the "come on" gesture.

"Come on lady. . Let's see what else you can do."* - Sat Nov 28 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (30 damage again) - Sat Nov 28 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was grabbed by the ankle, not ready for that he didn't have time to do anything but curse.

"Shit."  The next thing he knew he was spinning around in a circle.  Luckily for him he spins on a regular basis and this wasn't making him dizzy at all.  He was finally released and sent towards the wall.  He quickly flipped to correct himself and keep an eye on his opponent.  She was already on the move, coming right at him.  He had never hit the ground, so he didn't have a chance to sturdy himself.  He had to take this punch directly in the chest.  It connected and he winced a bit.  He quickly brought up his right hand and grabbed her left wrist so she could not get away this time.  He smiled as he held on to it.

"You want harder?  I gotcha girl."

While still holding on to her wrist, he threw a solid right roundhouse kick aimed at her left shoulder since he had her hand.  He quickly spun and switched whitch hand was holding her wrists.  Now with his left hand holding on and him spinning he attempted to sweep her.  With one final switch and spin he threw one final front kick aiming aimed at her rib cage. As the kick landed he would let go of her wrist.  He was trying to send her sliding along the sand.

"Should I hit you even harder next time?"* - Sat Nov 28 06:14:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was starting to do a bit of damage to her from what he could see.  But he was not doing enough.  he had to put more into it without hurting her too bad.  He woudl never forgive himself if he hurt her.  While he was guaging the amount of strength that he had use, she came back.  He could see her clearly, but being able to move himself completey out of the way was something else all together.  he was kicked in the head and took a step back.  She had hit him hard, but he was still barely feeling much of anything.  This time however, the damage was visible.  His cheek was red from the kick and his nose had leaked a small amount of blood.  He wiped his nose and smiled.

"I actually felt that one Nami.  I don't call you MSK for nothing.  Now let's see how you take my kick."

He would use the same foot that he had used to sturdy himself to pivot and throw a massive left kick to her side.  He was trying to send her flying past Kuro if that was possible.  This would be the strongest attack he had done this entire spar.  * - Sat Nov 28 06:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looked down at the letter and gave Nami a finger to wait for a second.

"You get one and I get one.  But let me see what Kuro needs."  

He squated down do eye level and placed his hand on his head, messing up his hair again.  

"Last two hits ok?  But you have to move now."

He woudl then turn to Nami and leave himself completely open.

"You first."* - Sat Nov 28 06:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) might have bit off a bit more then he could chew.  He was kicked in the chest and upon impact, a bit of blood came out of his mouth.  He went flying back into the wall, hitting it with a solid thud and then coughing up some more blood.  He fell on the ground face first and layed there for a second.  He slowly struggled up to his feet and wiped his mouth.  He then slowly walked over to Kinami, holding his chest.

"My turn."

He got in his stance and took a deep breath to calm himslef.  He then put everything he had into a single left roundhouse kick, hoping to send her flying tover to the far wall.  He did not want to drag Momura in this.  He stood there to see how well she would take the hit, while still holding on to his chest.* - Sat Nov 28 06:39:21 2015

"I swear kid we are the worst match.  You can do Earth Fire and Lightning.  I can do Earth Water and Wind.  How the hell did this happen?  Anyway you are about to learn how to make a clone.  You cool with that?"* - Sat Nov 28 18:28:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) shurgged his shoulders and opened up the scroll.  He was also a fast learner and figured that he would breeze through this without much trouble.  He had ssen the utsu first hand multiple times so this would be a fun change.* - Sat Nov 28 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looks at the paper and shakes his head.  

"Well you damn sure ain't trying it on me.  But you can try it on a clone if you want."* - Sat Nov 28 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) quickly made a clone and stepped off to the side, opening the scroll.  He was goign to read it as he watched the move that Kuro wanted to try.

"All you now buddy.  Let'er rip."* - Sat Nov 28 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had learned the jutsu already but decided to read it some more to get a better understanding of it.  He didn't want to interrupt Kuro as he tried to do something to his clone.

"Heheh. . Can't wait to see what he does."* - Sat Nov 28 18:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) //clone was destroyed by the golden sand coffin.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Why don't you like my lady Kuro? - Sat Nov 28 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looked at the paper and tightened his grip on it, causing wrinkles to form on it.  He stood up and walked over to Kuro.  He was not happy about what he just read and he needed Kuro to understand this.  He squated and gave Kuro the most intemidating glare that he could.  He would not touch him for fear of hurting him.  His voice shook as he started to speak.

". . . *sigh*. . Look Kuro. . . She likes to fight. . I do too. . . I am goign to keep her in check just like she is going to keep me in check. . . I have lost enough people close to me already and I am only 13.  . . I will not let her die on my watch without me dying first trying to protect her."  He started to shake from holding himself back.  He honestly wanted to slap the shit out of Kkuro, but he knew that he meant well.

"Just. . . Don't say that shit again ok Kuro. . .Thanks for the concern. . But next time. . I might not be able to hold back."* - Sat Nov 28 18:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had no idea exactly what Yi was made of just yet.  So to test him he decided to take the punches full on.  He smiled as the first punch connected with his rock solid chest.  Then another two punches would follow.  All three of them would connect, but Hiroshi would barely feel a thing.  He smiled at Yi and started to speak.

"Alright Yi. You got your hit in.  Now it is my turn to try and hit you."  A huge smile would form on his face as he sent a solid middle kick aimed at Yi's left rib cage.  He was not going full speed or full strength.  Matter of fact he was proabely undeestimating Yi, but it was ok.  He wanted to see how he could move.* - Sat Nov 28 19:43:34 2015
