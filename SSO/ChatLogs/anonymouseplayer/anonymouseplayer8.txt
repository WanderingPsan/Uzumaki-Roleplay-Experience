<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not made of stone.  He was trying to hold back everything but it wasn't working.  As Marissa was talking he broke down.  He had never really reacted to the fact that Sae had died.  The tears flowed from his eyes like two rivers.

"Why?  Why did she have to be killed?  I'm not supposed to lose my best friend?  I am 13. Thirt- fucking teen.  I shouldn' have to deal with this shit.  Why?. . .Damnit."  

He would just keep repeating Damnit he was crushed at this point.* - Sat Oct 31 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) listned to her as he let it all out.  He wouldn't give a response, but what she said would be heard and very clearly.* - Sat Oct 31 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Sanoke? - Sat Oct 31 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was once again standing in his litle training spot.  He was still pretty upset about recent events.  but everyone was right, he was a shinobi and he knew what he was getting into as soon as he enrolled in the academy.  With his best friend dead, he had two people to get stronger for, himself and Sae.  She lived on inside of him.  With that he started to train.  He gathered his wind natured chakra and ran through the seals that he needed.  He woudl then clap, signifying the activation of the jutsu.  A giant gust would come by him and blow sand into all of the rocks.  

Hiroshi wiped his eyes and clapped his cheeks twice.  He was trying to get himself together, but that wa not easy for him.  This was a pretty stressful situation.  "Come on Hiro.  Get it together.  Saeza wouldn't be having this issue.  She would be flying through all of this like it was nothing.  Nobody worked harder then her."  He once again he started to gather his vast amount of chakra.  It would swirl around him as he held a single seal.  He would then unleash his jutsu.  The winds, blowing his clothes all over the place, along with getting sand in his hair.

Hiro was goign as hard as he possibly could.  With the new found inspiration and faith from his teacher, he pushed himself as hard as he could.  Using the jutsu once more, with more control and precision each time.  "I won't let you down Mari. . . "

He started to think of Katsune as he trained.  He had only met her once and she seemed like a nice persone for real.  But all of that changed.  All of that changed with a single decision that she had made.  He honestly didn't know what he would do if he saw her.  He had faith in both Mari and Sir Hassan.  He had to do his best to stay out of their way, no matter how bad it hurt him on the inside.  He still had to be able to protect himself.  So he continued to train, using his sensei's technique again.

Hiroshi was starting to wear down.  He only had one more good one left in him before he would have to stop for a little while.  So he used it again and then sat on the ground.  He closed his eyes and tried to relax, the best that he could.* - Sat Oct 31 04:30:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) aint hear shit and walks back out I just needed food* - Sat Oct 31 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) awakes in his little spot and was ready to do some more training.  He had fallen asleep in this place. "Damn. . . I fell asleep.  Time to train some more."  He then smells himself.  "I need a shower."  That would have to wait though, he needed to train.  The village was on high alert, shit was happeneing left and right, and plus he just wanted to get stronger.  So he would put up the seals and clap his hands.  A wind would blow violentley from the west.  The few plants that were there would be ripped out of their place and smack the walls just like the sand.  

Today was a rather nice day here in Sunagakure.  The temperature was nice, at least to him, the wind was blowing only slightly, giving a nice refreshing breeze.  Hiroshi wanted to mess up that breeze with a mighty gust.  Thanks to his instructors he was able to do that.  He activated his jutsu and disrupted the breeze with a mighty wind.  "Damn. . . This makes me smell worse."

Hiroshi was not able to stop himself from stinking out here.  So he used a bitch version and ran to a house.  He had to take a shower, somewhere.* - Sat Oct 31 15:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had just made his first major purchase as a human being.  He had brough himself a nice house.  He could now do something his smell.  He brought some body wash, shampoo, and conditioner and waltzed straight into the shower.  "This is nice. . . I could get used to this.  I wonder if there is a place for me to train in here?  I should look around.  You know what?  I should learn to cook.  Well I gotta make sure I clean up real nice.  Been so long since I have had a good shower."  

Eventually he got out and dried off.  He then started to wander around his new house, smelling nice and clean.* - Sat Oct 31 16:02:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not fully aware of everything that Izanami could do.  He knew that she had talent from prior events, so he was not going to take this spar lightly.  It would likely be a good test for him.  He watched her closely as she made the seals and darted towards him.  She was coming in pretty fast, but Hiro wanted to try and use it to his advantage.  He quickly put up a single sTiger! seal and spewed out a river of mud.  He was trying to get her off balance, and he hoped that since she was running towards him it would narrow the window for her escape.  * - Mon Nov  2 02:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not all too surprised that Iza had dodged his initial attack.  He kept his eyes on her the entire time as she rose through the air.  The next thing that he knew she was throwing two shuriken that were moving quickly.  He would quickly clap his hands and activate yet another jutsu.  This time a wind would blow to send the shuriken away and he would leap up quickly to where Izanami was.  He would then throw a mighty heel drop, aiming to send her to the ground.  He, or coufrse would not be using his full strength cause if he found a way to hit he didn't want to harm her badly, this was only a spar.* - Mon Nov  2 03:06:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Think you can show me that charka enchanted strength technique now? - Mon Nov  2 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: That's not a technique I possess. - Mon Nov  2 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hey is he talkin about that thing. - Mon Nov  2 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would smile as he landed on the ground.  

"Didn't see that one coming.  O well, time to try something else. I knew this woudl be tough from the get go, but what else can she do?  So far all she has done is jump, a substitution, and trhow some shuriken with very high proficiency.  I have to make her do something else so I can know what is up.  Or at least try too."

With that he would dart off towards Izanami, trying to get close to her before she could do too much about it.  If he was able to get to her he would throw a simple right hook aimed at her stomach.* - Mon Nov  2 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Mon Nov  2 03:23:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Why is she holding back...Hm.. - Mon Nov  2 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: This is pretty boring. - Mon Nov  2 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not goign to stop now.  He was so close to her and he felt like she hadn't even shown him anything just yet.

"Ok, this is getting a bit frustrating.  She isn't doing anything.  It seems like she is just gathering intel on me or some shit.  She isn't fighting back, at least I don't feel like she is.  Lets see if this will make her fight back."

He would then throw a left roundhouse kick aimed at her right cheek.  This was more a feint then anything else.  As she was focused on the high kick, or so he hoped, he would spin into a sweeping low kick aiming to take her off of her feet.  He would end with a right push kick hoping to send her back just a few feet.  The entire time he was not using his full strength.  He did not want to hurt a comrade too bad in a spar.* - Mon Nov  2 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Come on Hiroshi I ahve money riding on this win! - Mon Nov  2 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had finally hit and made her do something.  He nodded his head upon her statement.  She was right, he might have done some major damage if this ere a life or death battle, but he couldn't bring himself to cause that much harm to a little girl.  It hurt him on the inside to even hurt her at all, but he needed to get stronger and he knw that she was powerful, despite her young appearance.  Just when he was about to make another move a fireball came his way.  He wasn't too far from her so he didn't have too much time.  That didn't stop him from trying.  He attempt to dive out of the way, towards the north.  He would get almost completely out of the way, but his foot was hit by the flames.  It actually didn't hurt as bad as he thought it would, but that bitch was still hot.  He started to pat his foot frantically on the ground, trying to put out the few flames that were there.  He would then give Izanami a confused look and then shrug it off.  

"She must be holding back too.  I thought that would have totally sucked, but it only slightly sucked.  O well."

He would then put his hands together and form 2 clones that would stand beside him for the time being.  The three Hiroshi's would watch Izanami closely, seemed like things were about to pick up.* - Mon Nov  2 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Children please - Mon Nov  2 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: -omit- - Mon Nov  2 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would nod his head upon her statement.

"Wouldn't accept anything left Izanami."

The fact that he actually said her entire name should have been some sort of indication that things were about to really get serious.  Hiroshi calls nobody by their full name once he is aquanted with them, exept for Sir Hassan but that was different.  Anyway, he and his three clones would jump into action.  

Clone 1 would run towards the clone that would be at Izanami's right side.  The clone would try a frontal assult with the clone and attempt a simple right hand to the face.  Since the clone knew that it was a clone it would be using all of the strength that a simple earth clone could muster.  

Clone 2 would follow clone 1's lead but he was going for the clone on the other side of Izanami.

Hiro would run threw a few hand seals and then spit out three air bullets aimed at the real Izanami, trying to seperate her from the crowd of clones.* - Mon Nov  2 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) //Both of HIroshi's clones would be easily dealt with and disperse.  They were too far gone to reform so that was it for them for now.

Hiroshi would watch Izanam didge the bullets easily, as he expected.  Once again she was throwing shuriken at him.  "Great, more shuriken."  He thinks to himself.  His sight was not great enough to see the wire string attactched to the shuriken so he was completely unaware.  As far as he was concerned, they were just three more shuriken coming at him again.  

"Why is she throwing them at me again?  I mean, she saw that I could just deflect them, why would she try again?  It makes no sense.  She must have something up her sleeve, but what is it?  Damnit. . . I can't tell what she is doing.  O wll I ave to do something about these things."  He thinks silently to himself.  He would run through three seals.  Dog! Rabbit! Snake!  He would then clap and call forth a wind that was much stronger then the first one.  This was not only to try and blow away the shuriken, but to also do something to both Izanami and her clones, if that was possible.* - Mon Nov  2 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not 100 percent caught off guard by this attack.  Now saying that he was expaecting her to move the shuriken and set some wires on fire is defintely a stretch.  He ain't see that shit coming, but he knew that she had something up her sleeve.  The fire being enhanced by the wind was not something that Hiroshi wanted to get caught by.  He had very little time to react, but he had some impressive reflexes and hoped that he was quick enough to do what he needed to to get the hell out of the way.  He would quickly put up a seal and dip into the ground with impressive speed.  He had a very good control of this jutsu so he was able to do this relatively quickly.  If he was able to do this he would stay under ground for the time being.  If not. . . I really don't know.* - Mon Nov  2 04:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had narowly avioded a roasting by slipping into the ground.  The only problem was that for some reason, he couldn't figure out where she was.  He stayed there for a second, trying to figure out what was going on.

"What the hell?  Where she go?  Can she fly or some shit?  Why sisn't she on the ground?  This little girl is driving me crazy.  I knew it wasn't goign to be an easy spar, or that I might lose.  But damn, this girl is on another level.  I don't even know where she is.  O boy, what now?  Do I come up where she was once at?  Do I just come back up where I went in?  What about those flaming shuriken?  Awwww hell too many questions.  Stop being a pussy Hiro and take your ass up there."  He would immediately resurface where he went under, looking for Iza.  He saw what she did and could do nothing but shake his head and laugh.

"You really are something Iza, you know that?  You got it.  I have nothing left I can do.  Good spar.  I learned a lot, thanks."  He would then walk over to her and extend his fist for a simple fist bump, hoping she would accept it.* - Mon Nov  2 04:33:04 2015

"Wasn't the answer that I was expecting but you are probably right.  O well, maybe I will learn it some other way."  He would then place a hand gentely on Iza's head.  "Your daughter here is one hell of a shinobi, Mr. Fuji."  He says smiling.* - Mon Nov  2 04:48:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: ....But, I'm telling the truth... - Mon Nov  2 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) gets a slightly concerned look on his face.

"But the truth can be funny sometimes can't it?"* - Mon Nov  2 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hahaha! I guess so!  - Mon Nov  2 19:40:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I'm always here or at the training grounds! - Mon Nov  2 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Really?  I was about to head to the training grounds myself want to come? - Mon Nov  2 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Nah... I onl ygot boring things to train with... I'm taking a break until I build up the urge to do it again. - Mon Nov  2 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would nod his head and turn to leave.

"Alright, see ya later."  He would say as he threw his hand up while walking.* - Mon Nov  2 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked into the little training area and got ready to train.  Even though things seemed pretty peacful for the time being he still needed to keep his abilities up.  Plus they were still on high alert.  With that being the case Hiro didn't know exactly how often he was going to be able to train, so he needed to do it while he could.  He pulled out his tanto and held it tightly in his hands.  He would then start to surge his wind natured chakra into it.  This would cause the blades offensive power to increase exponentially.  He would slowly walk up tot he wall and attempt to cut it.  Not too deep, bu tjust to be able to cut it was goign to be enough for him.  He didn't even leave a scratch.

Hiro would take a step back and look at the wall.  "If I can't even make a cut in the wall then I still have a lot of progress to make on this thing."  He would once again start to surge his chakra into the blade.  As he was doing this he thought of the process to himself.  "Grind against one another, grind against."  Then he would once again slash at the wall.  This time he scratched it, but it was such a light scratch he had to really struggle to see it.

Things were moving, but at a snails pace.  He still had to push through it.  Maybe if he changed things around a little bit he would be able to do this a little better.  He tried to think of the jutsu's technicallities before he did it again.  He was goign to leave some kind of gash in the wall this time damnit.

HIroshi reached behind him and grasped the tonto with his right hand.  He slowly lifted his hand up, unsheathing the tonto as he did so.  The sliver sword gleaming from the light of the sun.  He put his left hand on top of his right and then started to focus.  His chakra enveloped the blade and made a slight ringing sound.  He would once again slash with everything he had at the wall. "Aaauuuuuggghhhhh"   The wall would be slashed and Hiro would smile.

HIroshi was proud of himself.  He had made progress, a lot.  He surged his chakra through the blade a one last time and then fell to his but.  He was tired, this was not an easy thing to do repeatedly.  "I'm tired"* - Mon Nov  2 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had been resting for a litle while now.  He stood up and dusted his butt off.  "Ok, time to get back to my training.  I need to get this jutsu together before I do anything else."  He reached behind him and pulled out his trusty tonto once again.  He was no kenjutsu specialist, but he at least knew how to cut things up when he needed too.  He started to surge his chakra into his blade and it was surrounded by a light blue aura.  He would slash in the opposite direction that he did last timme and form an x on the wall.

Hiro looked at the X on the wall and smiled.  "I wonder what kind of dent Sae would have made?  She was a swordswoman.  I'm sure she could have sliced this entire wall in pieces if she wanted to."  He would then laugh at himself and continue training.  This was a good sign that he could think of her and laugh.  He had been in a bit of a funk since she had been killed.  Anyway he cut the wall again, this time making a straight line.

For some reason Hiroshi was obsessed with making his training at least a littel entertaining for himself.  He started to try and draw a picture with his slashes.  He made a few more and he had a terrible picture on the wall.  It looked like a 2 year old drew it.  He stared at it with a blank expression, he was speechless.  ". . . . "

There was an embarassing picture on the wall.  He had to do something about this quickly.  He slashed away at the picture and made it look as if it was just a series of slashes on the wall.  "THere was no way I was goign to let anybody see that shit.  I am no swordsman.  Glad I got my fists."

"All right, i need to try this one more time and then I can take a little break before goign back at it.  I have other things that I have to do."  HE would do what he said and then lean back against the wall.* - Mon Nov  2 20:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not goignt o do this too much longer, bu the wanted to make a little more progress before he called it quits.  He used it and slashed up the wall a bit.  This was going to be a quick little reveiw basically.

He thought about trying to make another picture.  He quickly changed his mind upon remembering the first one.  In that moment he slashed where the picture once was again, trying to cover it up some more.

There was no way tha the picture could be seen, but he kept on slashing.  That picture was the devil and he could let noone see it.  He had told Chiky that he was goign to be there so if anybody saw it he knew that she would be able to figure out that he was there.  "No chances."* - Mon Nov  2 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walks up and sits on the ground.

"So everyone is still just chilling here huh?"* - Mon Nov  2 20:50:59 2015
