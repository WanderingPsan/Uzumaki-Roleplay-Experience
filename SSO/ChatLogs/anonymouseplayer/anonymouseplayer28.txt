<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) dropped to the ground and started to push away.  He felt like Geo was trying to take his girl, and he aint like that.  So the entire time he did his push-ups, he was glaring at Geo.  "This bastard isn' taking her from me.  Not if I can help it."

Hiroshi did a lot of push ups so this was not that hard for him.  He was already on 5 and he felt like he had done nothing.  He was breezing through this.  But, he knew that this was just the beggining.  No reason for him to try and kill himself with the first task.  He kept on goign at a nice pace.  Steady, but still on the quick side.

It had been around 45 seconds and he only had a few more push ups to go.  He was still Geo, this man had rubbed him the wrong way.  he acknowledged his strength, but he was doing too much.  He finished his last few and stood up.  Stretching his arms a bit.  He would then start to speak to Nami.  "What's next?"* - Thu Dec  3 08:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Next up is thirty squats! - Thu Dec  3 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Lets get to it. - Thu Dec  3 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) *Hideo, Hiroshi lowered himself down to the ground.  He wanted to train and now he had two partners.  They were the same two people that he wanted to beat.  This being the case, he decided to push himself twice as hard asthey did.  That way he would take in twice the result, if that was possible.  With his hands now on the goround he started to lower himslf down.  This was only the beginning.

His fingers were wrapped tightly into a fist on each hand.  He had gotten into the habit of using his fists for push ups rather then his hands.  There were may ways to do push ups, but he was going to be switching throught them as he quickly got throught with his tenty.  He went down until his nips grazed the sandy, hot surface of the desert.  That was not a feeling that he was goign to deal with for an extended period of time.  He qqukcly started to go back up, his muscles activating and forcing his body to move against the pressure of gravity.

That was only the first of twenty.  He wanted to add a little something to each of these, so when he got to thte top he clapped his hands.  He caught himself by placing his hands back on the ground, bery close to each other.  He woudl form a diamond with the index finger and thumb on each hand touching.  This actually made the push up a little more challenging.  Not for Hiroshi, but it was a common way to challenge yourslef.

Down, down, down Hiro went.  The cool breeze of the night desert blowing by him.  Sand getting into his mouth.  Which, unfortunately, didn't even bother him anymore.  He had been living here his entire life and had gotten used to it.  He made sure that as he was going down, he kept his back flat and his butt down.  These seem like very basic things for him to do, but it was a lot harder then it sounded.  He reache the point where he was barely off of the ground.  He woudl then start to rise.

His arms were starting to feel a slgith tingle.  He was feeling the burn in both of his arms.  From his forarm muscles to his bicepts, tricepts, and even in his pectorals.  This, all a result from pushing himself to the limit even with something as simple as push ups.  He reached the apex of the rise and pushed off as hard as he could.  eh clapped his hands and caught himself with just his left hand placed directly under the middle of his chest.

He had done a couple with each style so far and was already on the number 14.  After this he would push through to the end to get to his last few.  He lowered himself with just his off left hand.  Well, he could use both, but he preferred his right.  His left arm hit the 90 degree mark and he then reversed it.  He would get to teh sarting position and finish the rest out.

"

He finished his last few and stood up.  Stretching his arms a bit.  He would then start to speak to Nami.  "What's next?"** - Thu Dec  3 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Right. - Thu Dec  3 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) put his hands on his head and pepared to do the squats as Nami commanded.  As he started to lower himself down to the ground a song popped in his head.  He couldn't help but start to sing it. "Playe, five me some brew an I might just chill.  But I'm he type tht like to ligh another joint ike Cypress Hill."  By the time that he had hit that point, he had reached the sitting positions.  It was time to rise up now.

He started to rise as the climax of the first verse.  "I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it.  I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it.  Go get the S t. I d e s Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rolliing joingts like a cigarette.  So pass it across the table like ping pong, I'm gone. Beating my chest like King Kong."  He got back to the original spot.  His head bobbing up an down, he was partying.

He took off his jacket right fast.  he din't want to mess it up.  He already had his shirt in a safe spot so he just moved his jacket there and re captured his position.  Down he went again, still singing his song.  This quads being lit ablaze by the slow speed at wchich he was going.  He sat in that imagionary chair and exploded off of it, but not too hard,  He was still going slow.

Up he went.  These were some intense ass squats.  He was enjoying himself.  He changed gears though.  He started singing a song that he hadn't heard in forever.  His smooth voice leading the way.  Being very punctual and precise with how he would say each word, sing each note each note.  This was something to see or hear.  Nobody knew of his hiddedn talents.  He was still doing that squat though.

He had reached the start again and went back down.  He had done a few squats, but he still had quite a few to go.  He was still trying to push himself harder then both of them.  He felt like he was the weak link and he couldn't accept that.  Down he went slowly on the decline to his destination.  That chair was awaiting his booty.  The chair was a mean chair, so mean, it was hot and the instant that one touched it, they would reverse direction and head back up.  All this was a figment of Hiro's imagination, but it helped him focus.

His booty hit that scolding hot chair and he popped off of it.  He was so into his imagionation that he had forgotten that the chair wasn't even there, or hot.  He let out a quick yelp and continued to rise.  Still singing.  "Can't help myself don't want nobody else to  ever love me." He was done with this squat and starting to go back down.

Back down he went, his body moving to the rhythm of the song that his muscles were singing.  "Burn baby burn, Disco inferno."  His muscles were all moving at an amazing rhythm.  That didn't stop him though.  He continued to push himself past his breaking point.  That might not be a good thing, but he had to do what he had to do.

That chair was still waiting on him.  He and the chair was in a battle that seemed like it had no end in sight.  He was not going to let that chair dcide anything for him.  He touched the chair, knees bent,  hamstrings parallel to the earth.  He then started to go back up.  The rising of the young shinobi was an entirly new battle.  One that he had to overcome to get to what he wanted to get to.

With the chuunins coming up, all he could think about was getting stronger.  He had too, plus, it seemed like everytime he turned around somebody else was there to try and show them how much stronger they were then him.  It inspired him even more.  His legs never stopped pushing agianst the ground.  He was like a phoenix in the night.  Hiroshi was going to do this.  He had too.

Was finally starting to get to the latter half of these squats  This was really like he was fighting an entire war with himself.  His will, versus his muscles.  What 
was going to come first.  Him finishing the squats, or his body giving out.  What was going to come first.  Only time would tell.

He looked across from him and noticed how hard Kinami was working.  He had an influx of emotions come over him.  He was proud to see her working so hard, knowing how strong she already was.  It was a sight to see.  Her face shining from the sweat accumulating on it.  To him, she looked like an angel.  He didn't want to let her down, so he continued squat his damn self..

He started to go back up.  He was still looking over in her direction.  He smiled at her he went down for the last.  He had finished his 30.  He stood there with a smile on his face watching her.  Seemed he had finished before her.  "Go Nami go!"* - Thu Dec  3 08:56:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was hugged, he wasn't expecting it, but he damn sure was happy about it.  He embraced her back with a giant smile.  He then looked a Geo with a look of victory.  He wouldn't say anything outloud to him, his eyes said it all.

"I'm sorry Nami.  I was so captivated by how hard you were working, I stopped.  You looked like an angel."* - Thu Dec  3 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Hmm my first victory in a while. . . You are moving up Hiro. . .You are moving up. .  - Thu Dec  3 09:15:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was completely thrown off by this one.  He wasn't expecting a kiss out of this.  This was the first kiss he had recieved from a woman besides his mother.  He blushed a bit and smiled at her.

"You could have warned me.  I would have been more ready.  But,. . .Thanks, you don't know how long I waited for that one."* - Thu Dec  3 09:17:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Right now. - Thu Dec  3 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: This man ain't going to keep on knocking me like this. . .  - Thu Dec  3 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I'll win this one for you beautiful!~ - Thu Dec  3 09:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: This is going to be hard. . . .  - Thu Dec  3 09:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) didn't realize that Geo was so dirty to attack while he was looking at his girl walk away.  If that was how he wanted to handle it, that was fine.  He could see Geo out the corner of his eye, The instant he moved, Hiro tried to move, but it was useless.  He still had his weights on, he didn't plan on keeping them on, but he was in the air now.

"This bastard. . . "* - Thu Dec  3 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) heard something that set him off like never before.  Geo had messed with him too much now.  Nami could not hear the words that Hiro had heard.  But that was it for him.   He had some cotton stuffed on the inside cause it used to hurt his back.  He landed on the ground, onto his shell.  The shell taking most of the damage that his back would have recieved.  He had little time to do anything, but lucky for him, his feet are back on the ground.  He had a way out, but it was going to make him not able to attack, o well he had a point to prove now.  He put up a single seal and poofed out of the way of the kick, by mere centmeters.  He appeared a decent distance away from Geo and stood there.  He dropped his shell and spit out a bit of blood.  Hiro looked like a man posessed.  HIs pupils were gone and he had a sinister look on his face.  

"You went too far. . . Too far. . SHE IS MINE DAMNIT!!!!"* - Thu Dec  3 09:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was livid.  He could not belive that Geo felt that he had to say something like that to try and get him to focus.  Because of that, he was going to go as hard as he could.  He needed to create a bit of distance between the both of them.  He jumped back a bout 5 paces.  He was so much faster now that he dropped that shell.  He wasn't done though.  He felt his anger starting to overwhelm him.  He wanted to save this, but he was about to unleash it for the first time.  He shot Nami a quick smile and then focused back on Geo.  

"Was saving this, but, now you pissed me off Geo.  I know you can do it too, so no worries.  Gate of Opening, OPEN."

The first of the eight inner gates had been tapped into by Hiroshi for the first time.  He felt like he had never felt before.  He started to run some more, using a speed he had never had before.  He was hoping that he was moving way to fast for Geo to follow him with a normal set of eyes.* - Thu Dec  3 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not able to get what he wanted to get done as fast as he wanted too.  But that was ok, he was tired of thi srunning type shit.  He was going to stand there and they were about to have a slug fest.  Hopefully he wouldn't get too banged up, but Hiro was wreckless, things were bound to happen.  With his sharp eyes he saw every single thing that  Geo was throwing.  He started throwing punches in bunches with Geo.  Their hands were flying, the impact of theri fists colliding causing tiny shockwaves.  Nothing too dramatic but they was punching da shit out of each other.  Then came the next phase of this trade off.

Geo started to open the Gate of Healing, he was not going to let him recover fully before he got the chance.  They were right on top of each other, so he tried to give Geo a mighty kick in the chest sending him flying over to the rock. What was next?* - Thu Dec  3 10:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was losing energy extremely fast here.  He was able to open the gate, but maintaining it for an extended period of time was something he was goign to have to work on being able to maintain it.  He had gotten a hit in this time and was proud, but not satisfied.  The blows came again in bunches.  Each of the hands looking into each others hand eyes and what not.  Seing that Geo was airborne, Hiro would use the opportunity to attack.

When one of Geo's fist came he would step to the side and throw a might straight kick to send him higher into the air.  He was hoping to set him up for a future attack.  He put everything he had into this kick.  If he hit him then he was going to fly high into the air.  But with his dura, he was gucci.* - Thu Dec  3 10:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: O shit. . I'm going to hard.. . .  - Thu Dec  3 10:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would watch as Nami delivered that same combination that she had put on him to Geo.  He figured that he was in some considerable pain after that, even if he was really tough.  So he ran at Nami, aiming to throw an attack at her to show her his improvement personally.  He smiled as he ran at her, pulling his right hand back as he did.  When he got within range, The effects of the gates being activated for the first time finally took it's toll.  Instead of a punch, the gate turned off and he fell to the ground, face first.  He had lost too much stamina.  He just layed there, face first on the ground, unable to move.  He spoke softly, his vioce being mufled even further by the sand.

"mmmmmDamnit. . . mmmmm Lost. . . too much.m m m mmm mmm stamina. . mmmm can't. . . .mmmmmm move."* - Thu Dec  3 10:46:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walks away silently.* - Thu Dec  3 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked into his home.  He felt like a new man now.  The other day was the best day of his young life.  He had gotten a kiss from the girl of his dreams.  He chuckled as he goit onto the floor.  HIs back flat against the carpet of his house.  His feet flat on the ground, hands locked behind his head.  This was just the beginning of his training.

He started to bend at the waist, the muscles in his abdomen contracting as he slowly brought his chest up to his knees.  Keeping himself inspired with words of encouragement to himslef.  "That damn jumpsuit wearing, want to try and steal my girlfriend wanna be, think he can talk to me how he want ass bastard.  I will not let him beat me.  I refuse, she is mine damnit."

Hiro's knees were touched by his chest.  As soon as they did, he reveresed his direction.  His back slowly approaching the carpet once more.  "One. . Two. . . Three. . "  Counting each one of these sit ups as his pace started to increae a bit.  He had been shwon already, he needed to increase his stamina.  All of this training was brutal.

"Seven. . . Eight. . Nine. . ."  He continued to count.  His mind was focused on nothing else.  All he could thing about was training, training, and a little bit more training.  He had reasons to get stronger, he had people that he had to get stronger for.  Hiro was not going to let anybody stop him from doing what he wanted to do.  As he continued the situps he was starting to sweat a bit.

"Twelve. . Thirteen. "  Each of the sit-ups mirroring the one he had done prior.  He thought of his little bro.  He had just met Green, but he was close to that little guy already.  He couldn't imagine going through life without the little fella.  He smiled as he was doing his sit-ups.  "I gothcu bro."

" Fifteen. . Sixteen. . Seventeen. . "  Was now over half way done with the first set of what he was going to do.  The tempo at which he was going, starting to change a bit.  There was a song wrapped up in his head tha was making him even more inspired.  He continued to push through to the other side of his goals.

"Tweny. .Twenty-one. .  Twenty-Two."  Sit up after sit up.  Hiroshi was not going to let Kinami stay out in front of him.  The nice thing to say would be that he wanted to walk beside his woman.  But, that wasn't what he wanted at all.  He knew how strong she was, but he still wanted to walk in front.  He wanted to be the one to face the obstacles that came thier way.  He wanted to be the one that if things went down, she could just smile and tell him. "Go gettem Hiro!"  

"Twenty-eight. . Twenty-nine. . .Thirty"  He had finished, but he was still thinking about passing Kinami.  He didn't want anything to even get within touching range of her without going through him first.  He made a promise to himself tha he wasn't goign to lose anyone else.  Sae, Mari-Sensei, both of them were important people in his life and he was not even there to help them in their time of need.  That wasn't going to happen again.

He rose up to his feet and brushed off his butt.  His floor wasn't dirty or anything, but he had formed the habit grom always sitting on the sand.  He started to peform a few stretches to loosen himself up some more before he continued.  Stretching was an important part of exercise too.

Hiroshi extended his right arm all the way across his body.  He took his left arm and placed the inside of his elbow, against his right elbow.  He pushed down on his right arm lightly and could feel the stretch occuring throught the specific location that he was targeting.  Next.

Flipping the entire situation around.  His left on the bottom and his right on the top now.  The same stretch was applied to his left arm.  He needed to make sure he was nice and limber so he could perform all of these exercises to the best of his ablity.

Now, nice and limber, he would continue to do his excercises.  There was only so much that he could do in his own home.  But it was fine for now.  He would get more things done when he and Paine-Sensei resumed their training.  He enjoyed working with her.  She was the strongest taijutsu user tht he knew.  He wasn't going to let her stay out in front of him for long either.  "Go Go Go."  He would yell at himself as he started his next excercise.

Would start to do something that was intense as hell.  He was going to combine a set of excersises all into one motion, but each set was only goign to be one.  He started by going down into a single push up.  He went down towards the ground, slowly.  His arms bending as he reached the 90 degree mark.  Pushing against his floor, he started to rise up.  One to the next one.

He held the push up at the starting position.  As he did so, he jumped, but he didn't let his hands off of the ground.  Instead of letting himself go up, he brought his feet to his hands on the ground.  He looked as if he was a toe touch.  He quickly got back into the starting position and kept it moving.

He hopped to his feet and quickly got into squating position.  Down he went, his muscles starting to feel the burn of this entire excersise.  He touched his imagionary chair and rose up.  His legs starting to extend to full length again.  "Push it Hiro  . . Push it Hiro. . . Push it"  He got back to the upright position and and continued this extensive excersise.

He started to lift his heels off of the ground. until he was standing on his tippie toes.  He felt the stretch of his calfs from this part of the excercise.  He was starting to get tired and wanted to stop.  Then the image of Kinami kicking the shit out of him made the fatigue all rush out of him.  "Hell nah. . Not happening."

He was almost done with one.  All he had now was the final part.  He leapr into the air and brought his knees up to this chest.  It looked like he was basically doing a cannonball on nothing, but he was going it.  He landed on his feet and wipe his face.  ". . . One. . . "* - Thu Dec  3 22:50:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would nod his head towards Mirai.  He had faught Mitsu before, so he figured she could handle herself for the time being.  Hiroshi was very interested in what Mirai did before they started this fight.  He had never seen anybody with eyes like hers.  He had no idea what they could do, or what to expect from them, that excited him.  Without any further hesitation, he dashed off towards Mirai, ready to try and land the first hit.

Once he got within striking distance of Mirai, he would attempt to throw a solid left roundhouse kick aimed at her right cheek.  This was more of a feint then anything else, but he was still trying to hit her with it if that was even possible.  Hopefully, while she is focused on the high kick, he would spin and throw a quick, sweeping low right kick to try and set her up for a final push kick aimed directly at her stomach.* - Fri Dec  4 00:48:38 2015

It was just the fact that she matched him blow for blow.  This made him even more excited.  Seemed like Mirai was about to be a tough opponent.

Hiroshi was not going to stop his attacks just yet.  He was a bit on the stubborn side when it came to things like this.  He smiled at her and then tried something new.  He attempted to slip into the ground and pull Mirai under, to the point where just her head was sticking out of the ground.  * - Fri Dec  4 01:03:08 2015

Hiro reached in his pouch and pulled out a single smoke bomb.  He threw it at the ground directly in gront of Mirai, he was hoping that either she would move out of the way, and be left open for him to be able to attack.  Hiroshi would react according to Mirai's actions.   Wherever she went, he would be right there on top of her again, attempting to throw a mighty right hook at her rib cage while she was vulnerable, hopefully.* - Fri Dec  4 01:15:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was totally unaware of Mirai's Dojutsu.  As far as he was concerned, she just got a few veins on her face out of nowhere.  He had no earthly idea what they actually did, or how they even worked.  She was the first person he had ever faught aggainst that had this ability.  Hiroshi had sharp eyes and could see her figure in the smoke.  He couldn't see any major details such as the veins on her face or anything right now.  He was pretty sure that he was going to be able to do something with that last tactic.  Too bad he was wrong.  She knocked his hand away effortlessly, and he saw a blue glow in the smoke.  He had no idea what it was, this was the first he had ever seen of it.  It shot towards him at a high speed, he leaned back and barely avoided the blow.  Her hand right above his head, still glowing the same light blue color.  Hiro was starting to get the feeling that the smoke was more of an advantage to her then it was to him.  He quickly emerged from the smoke and slid back wiping his forehead.

"Ok. .  No more smoke."  He would say as he stood there awaiting Mirai's next attack.* - Fri Dec  4 01:33:00 2015

She leapt into the air and did something that he recognized very clearly.  He knew the technique also, and pretty well.  He smiled, as he felt that this might be one of the few opportunities that he had to try and do something in this spar.  He didn't try to move.  He just put his hands up, to try something new.

The kick came and made contact with his hands.  He slid back from the impact, but latched on to her ankles with his hands.  He would then attempt to throw her foot in the air, to cause her to flip.  At that moment, she was suspended upside down and facing in the other direction.  Hiro wasted no time and jumped quickly into the air.  He attempted to deliver a solid kick in her back to send her back where she began.  There was not much power behind the kick.  The only thing he wanted to accomplish with it was to push her back.  That was it.* - Fri Dec  4 01:44:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had landed a hit, and was not going to stop the attacks just yet.  He finally had a chance to do something, this might not happen again.  As she was flying through the air, he had landed on the ground.  He started to sprint at her again as she was flying.  She recovered and was back on her feet. But, by the time she was back on her feet, he was there again.  She had stopped this attack the first time, now with less time to react he would try it again.

Hiroshi threw a might roundhouse kick towards her right rib cage.  He was still not using all of his stength, since this was indeed still a spar.* - Fri Dec  4 01:59:28 2015

He didn't have much time to celebrate.  She recovered quickly and attacked him again.  He couldn't move out of the way of this one and felt two palms to his abdomen.  He took a step back, waiting on the pain to come.  He pat himslf down, confused. 

 "What?  That didn't h-"  In the middle of the statement.  He felt something going on inside of his body.  It seemed that this had effected him on the inside, not the outside.  He was not sure what had just happened to him, so he darted backwards again, trying to figure out what had just happened.  The entire time he had a hand on his abdomen.

"What the hell was that?"  He thinks to himself.* - Fri Dec  4 02:13:58 2015
