<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) put his hands up into a single seal and focused all of his chakra into his feet.  They started to glow a light blue color around the soles of his shoes.  He began to talk as he walked towards the wall.

"Ok, basically.  You focus your chakra into the bottoms of your feet.  ONe you are able to do that you simply maintaint it, and you can do things like this."  He would then walk up the wall and stand there sideways.  He would continue his little teaching session.

"This jutsu not only allows you to do this.  But you can walk on water too.  This requires very delacate chakra control.  If you used too much, you will just break the rock and cause a whole in the wall.  Then you will probably lose your balance and fall.  If you don't use enough, you will not even make it to standing sideways.  You will simply just fall.  Ok, now you two try and gather your chakra into your feet.  Once you can maintain this for about 5 minutes, you can then start to attempt to walk up the wall.  Don't worry about falling, I will be there to catch you."  He would say as he jumps off of the wall and onto the ground.  

"Now give it a try."* - Wed Dec  2 07:16:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) put his instructor glasses back on and took a step back.  He stretched a bit, and then got into his normal fighting position.  He would then begin to speak.

"Ok Nami.  You said that you know the Leaf Great Whirlwind.  So this one should be very very easy for you to get the hang of.  Basically, it is a series of kicks.  The only thing that is really special about it is the first and second kick.  Everybody that uses this jutsu starts with a high kick to set up for a low kick.  After that it is your personal choice what you do.  Now, The high kick is more of a feint then an actual attempt to hit them.  But if you are going to hit them, hit'em.  The kicks main purpose is to draw your opponents attention to this kick so the sweeping low kick will catch them by surprise.  You have to be sure that your movements are very fast and fluid.  I will demonstrate and then you can give it a go."

He would then throw a right high kick.  Spin, throw a sweeping left kick.  And finish off with a simple front kick.

"Ok.  On you."* - Wed Dec  2 07:45:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was pretty excited about this little training excersie.  This was going to be something different and he liked it.  Without much thinking he shot into action.  He ran at Kinami, but with the weights on his back, he wasn't moving as fast as usual.  It was ok, he needed to extrra work anyway.  Once he got close enough to hit her he tried to throw a combination of kicks her way.  He knew how tough she was so he held back nothing.  He still couldn't bring himself to hit her in the face though.  So instead of the high kick being aimed at her face, it was going for her shoulder.  Then with a spin, a sweeping low kick.  Knowing that his move probably wouldn't knocke her off her feet, he spun one last time and thre a mighty straight kick towards her stomach.* - Wed Dec  2 08:42:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was met half way by Kinami and she sent an attack at him, at his head in fact.  it wasn't as fast as usual and he leaned out of the way, not even thinking about attempting his own kick at first.  Nami didn't stop there.  She used the technique that she had just been taught, and pretty damn good too.  He had moved out of the high kicks way, but the low kick was at him before he knew it.  He didn't have enough time to completely move out of the way, but surprisingly, it didn't really hurt him.  With all of that over he went back on the attack.  He didn't know what she had planned next, but she was not done.  All he could do was hope that he would have a chance to try and do something the same time she did.  He knew an attack was coming, just not what it was going to be.  So in an effort to trade blows, he threw a solid right hand towards her spinning abdomen.

"Hope this works."* - Wed Dec  2 08:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was right to anticipate another move coming his way.  As he had predicted, another kick came flying his way.  He was wide open from his previous attack.  He felt the kick start to lift him up into the air.  Then before he knew it, another flurry of kicks were coming his way.  This was turning into a clinic on how to juggle a human being.  Higher and higer he went into the air, utnil he finally felt the kicking stop, but just for an instant.  The moment he thought he was goign to be able to fall down to the earth, he felt a final foot on his shoulder and he started to fall towards the earth.  He looked at Kinami, not wanting to show her the pain he was in from her kicks.  He was at her mercy for the time being, but he was still smilng this entire time.

"That was a nice move right there. I need to learn it. . . ."  He thinks to himself as he falls.* - Wed Dec  2 09:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was in a pretty bad spot.  This girl was having her way with him right now.  He was defenseless, in the air, darn that pain though.  Before he even hit the ground he heard her voice again, right behind him.  She said something about her secret technique, but he had never seen her use it.  He remembered the name instantly, but he wasn't too happy about the fact that he was the one he had to see it on.  In any case, he felt the attacks start to make contact with his body.  First, a left kick into his side that made him turn.  Next, a kick to his right side.  The pace at which they were falling started to pick up.  The entire time, Hiro was clinching his teeth, trying to mask the pain that he was in.  Those kicks were pretty powerful.  He hit the ground, landing on his shell.  Then, before he could try and rise to his feet, he was kicked one last time in the stomach.  He layed there for a second, catching all the air that he had just had kicked out of him.  He then struggled to his feet.

"Wow. . Nice move.  That hurt.  I am going to have to get you for that one Nami~"  He would say with a smile, wiping a bit of blood from his mouth.  He was too tired to make an immediate move right now.* - Wed Dec  2 09:16:22 2015

He saw Kinami shed her shell, so he did just that his damn self.  He dropped his shell and started to run to her as well, dodging the various bullets.  He wanted to start a clash like scenario.  He wasn't sure who was physically stronger, her, or him.  Now was goign to be the time to find out.  Meeting her half way, he leapt into the air and performed the same technique.  Hoping to meet her foot to foot.  Whoever was more powerful was goign to win thie clash.  Now to find out who.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had won the little clash of strength.  But, not by much.  He landed the same way she did, a few feet back and sliding on the ground a small bit.  He leaned back and out of the way of an oncoming air bullet.  He wasn't about to tease Sanoke about being able to dodge the bullets, trying to dodge Kinami was hard enough.  Then, clones were made by Sanoke and Hiro shook his head.  "Damn. . .More stuff.  Oh well.  This is fun!"  He thinks to himself.

Before he knew it, Nami was coming again, dodging the bullets as she closed the distance.  Hiro watched her like a hawk, keeping track of her every move.  A fist came towards his nose and he leaned back out of the way.  He also had seen the fist coming towards his rib cage.  Since he was leaning back already, he was not going to be able to lean another way fast enough to move out of the way.  But, he could however change what she was goign to hit.  He tucked his arm, and put his elbow there to take the impact.  This still hurt, but it was better then letting her hit him directly in the ribs.  She jumped back, and he decided to go on his offensive.

He charged at her, doging the various bullets that came his way.  Once within range, he threw a solid left hook aimed at her right rib cage.  That wasn't it though.  With his right foot, he followed with a swift knee aimed at her stomach.  * - Wed Dec  2 09:44:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (oh, alright xD) - Wed Dec  2 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was moving in so many different directions that his mind couldn't keep up.  He basically had to shut off his brain and just react to the oncoming bullets of air coming at him.  He had his knee stopped and noticed the same Airbullet that Nami had seen.  He didn't move until she had firmly planted bot of her feet in his chest to leap back.  He was more concerned for her saftey then his.  But, since he had waited, he had less time to react.  All he could do, was fall to the ground as the bullet ripped part of his jacket.  He quickly got up and onto his feet.  He didn't have time to mourn the loss of that piece of fabric.

He kept his eyes focues on Kinami, watching her every move.  She started to charge again, dodging various bullets.  This was really starting to become a sight to see.  He decided to charge back at her.  He was planning on meeting her in the middle.  He leapt over a bullet and as soon as his feet hit the ground he had to tuck into a quick baseball slide under another.  He popped to his feet and continued to run.  He drew back to throw yet another punch at her.  This was going to be a nice clash again.

The moment that Hiroshi and Nami's attacks were about to collide, a bullet came roaring at both of them.  They both moved quickly out the way, seperating themselves once again.  All these bullets were really starting to make things difficult.  He did not have time to allow himself to slide into a halt.  Instead, he turned and used the momentum to start to run.  They each looked as if they were rinning in a circle, flipping, sliding, twisting all aroung the bullets.  As he ran he called out to Nami.

"Where in the hell did you get this idea girl?  This is the most fun I have had in a while.~"  He would say with a giant smile.  The smile didn't stay there too long though, he had to dodge another bullet.  That damn Sanoke.* - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) jumped back as well.  He was just in one hell of an exchange.  Unfortunately for him, he did not have the amount of stamina that Kinami had.  She stood there, breathing as if everything was all fine and dandy.  But Hiro, on the other hand, was breathing pretty heavily.  He was trying to catch his breath the best he could.  Even though he was a bit fatugued, he was smiling.  He was having the time of his life.  He was in a spar like never before with the only person the he knew would even give him a match so even.   

He didn't have much time to really catch his breath.  There were too many things flying around him.  Plus, he knew he couldn't last much longer simply from the fatigue.  This was going to be his last hurah righ there.  This was his last attempt to try and find a way to come out victorious in this spar.  He darted off once again, leaping and twisting over all of the various bullets coming from each direction.  Another exchange was started to take place.  This was going to decide the battle.

They had gotten in sync, completely.  They were throwing so many attacks so fast, some people might even miss a few of them.  These two were truly impressive when it came to taijutsu.  Hiro threw a solid round hose kick towards Kinami's face.  She looked like she knew what was coming, because as soon as he threw the kick she knocked it back down before he could even get through his entire motions.  Swiftly, she threw an elbow towards Hiro's nose.  He smiled and leaned back.  He continued to lean and attempted to give her a solid backflip kick right onto her chin.  He wiffed and flipped completely around to his feet.  At that instant, both of them ducked in unison as a series of bullets flew over their heads.  Then back to the actions.

Hiro was finally starting to slow down.  Nothing seemed to be working.  But he kept on the attack.  Kinami dodging everything that he threw at her.  He gritted his teeth and went for one final roundhouse kick towards her shoulder.  He was so focused on her that a bullet came and nipped his back.  This bullet was powerful and it stopped his kick completely.  "Hnng"  He woudl fall to a knee as a series of bullets started to come his way.  What was Kinami going to do?  Win the spar?  Or help Hiro out of the way.  Let's see what happens.* - Wed Dec  2 10:28:03 2015
