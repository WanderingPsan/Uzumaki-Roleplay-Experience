<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sounds fun. - Sun Nov 29 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not sure what the hell Nami was doing, but she was a strong lady and he knew that she could handle herself.  This was just training after all so he had to focus on his training so he could get stronger.  The balls bounced all around him as he started to approach Paine.  He skillfully dodged each one with a side step here, a slide there, things like that.  A single ball slipped past his field of vision and caught him on the side of his arm.  He did not expect it to hurt as much as it did so he slowed down a bit and grabbed his arm.

"Damn. . What did you put in those balls Sensei? They hurt."* - Sun Nov 29 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was trying the best he could to help them both out.  But this was a bit more then he could handle.  He started to run over to support Kyu, who was supporting Momu, but he fucked up.  With his sharp vision he would not miss his Senpai walking into the training area.  He was so overjoyed to see her he was not looking where he was going anymore.

"Ri-Sen-"  

Was all he had time to get out before colliding with Kyu and sending them both crashing to the ground.  A ball gently. . .Well not gently these heavy ass balls. . . Anyway the ball grazed his right shoulder as he hit the ground.  He started to rise to his feet to continue training.* - Sun Nov 29 03:27:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was working well with Chikyu for the time being and was a bit surprised by their coordination.  After everything she had put him though recently, she was still good peeps.  He felt her hand push him out of the way of an oncoming ball.  

"Thanks."

As he said thanks he continued to run, doging the various balls coming his way.  When he was back beside her he rabbed her hand and stood her up so she could attack with him.  He saw what she was doing and decided to basically do the same thing she was.  He figured the balls would do more then he could to Sensei anyway.  He looked up and noticed a ball coming directly for him.  He smiled, stepped back, and timed a solid roundhouse kick at the ball.  HIs ball flying towards Paine in unison with Chiky's.  The only difference was that his was going for a different spot, but it was still aimed at her torso area.

"Hope this works. . ." HE thinks to himself.* - Sun Nov 29 04:02:46 2015

"Hey there Ri-Senpai!"  

He would then glance at Kyu. .

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked into his house and was about to do a little training.  He didn't seem to have a lot of free time as of late.  There were a lot of thngs that seemed to be distracting him.  But he was ok with it, he ha gotten himself into all of it and he wouldn't change a thing.  He walked into his bed rom thrusting his fingers in the air.  Aiming to perfect the move Sensei had taught him.

He cntinued to thrust his fingers in the air.  As he did so he started to think of Kinami and stood there for a second.  "What am I going to do for her?  I need to do something off the wall to catch her by surprise.  But I don't want it to be something that she doesn't like.  I want her to be so excited she just jumps into my arms. . "  He started to smile "Yeaaah. . . I like the sound of that.

Hiro quickly shook his head and tapped his own wrist.  "Bad Hiro.  Train boy." He continued to thrust his fingers in the air.* - Sun Nov 29 12:49:16 2015

He pulled out a single Kunai and squated down.  He attempted to do the same thing that she did.  When he was finished he stood up and looked down.  He turned his head to the side in confusion.  The pickture looked nothing like what Kyu had just done.  It looked more like a bunch of random straight lines and curved lines.  It was terrible.
