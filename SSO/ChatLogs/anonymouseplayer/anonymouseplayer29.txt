He wipes his nose and smiled at her.

"I will get one after this."

Thier attacks clased and he just smiled at her.  This was when he was having the most fun.  When they were sparring together.  He forgot about everything else, all of his problems, school, that jutsu he never got to finish learning, all of it.  There were only the people involved in this spar in the world right now.

After a couple of the hits he jumped back onto the wall behind him, activating his suimen.  He held his stomach and looked at her with a confused face.  He was ready to move if she decided to come back, but for the time being, he stood there.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) leaves the area with his hands in his pockets.* - Fri Dec  4 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked into the academy with his head held down.  He had not been doing the best in this going to school situation.  He always found school to be a bore, no challenge to him whatsoever.  Still, apparently he had been missing too many clases and needed to catch up.  Plus he didn't think that his little bro had been going to school either.  He had to cover for both of their asses at this point.  "Ok. . I have a lot to do before the chuunins start."

He saw his instructor and walked over to her.  He started to speak, as clearly and professional as he could.  "Hello.  I am sorry I have  not been in class very often as of late.  I was training a lot for the chuunins and I sort of forgot about it.  If  there is anything that I can do to make up all of this work I will.  I will do extra work and everything.  Can you help me out this one time?  Please."  He looked at her directly in her eyes, not averting his gaze for a second.  Trying to show how genuine he was at this very moment.

The woman laughed and gave him a smile.  "So you are good enough to be in the finals?  You must be Hideo-kun.  You are the only male left as far as I know.  You are fine, I know how important it is for a shinobi to improve.  I will allow you this pass one time.  You cannot forget how important school is ok?"  Hiro smiled and nodded his head.  "Right!"

He sat down at the desk, with his teacher.  She started to go over all of the things tht he had missed.  From the prvious Kazekage, to a few of the Mizukage, Hokage, and various other things.  There were a few scenario type things in there also.  The woman was astounded at how fast Hiro soaked in all of this information.  He was a genius after all.  "My my.  Aren't you a smart one?  She would say to him.

Hiro smiled and nodded his head.  "I always have been good at remembering things.  Its like, I see it once, focus on it, and then I seem to remember it."  The instructor nodded and continued to teach him everything that he needed to know.  This was all starting to make Hiro feel a lot better.  Trill had really messed him up with all of that no pass no ninja talk.

The make up lesson was finally done and the actual lesson was about to start.  Because Hiro was so incredibly smart, he was able to catch up in a single lesson.  The instructor pat him on his head lightly.  "Wow.  Your all caught up hun.  I'm amazed at how fast you got all of this.  You get ready for todays lesson.  Just find a seat anywhere you want."  Hiro would sit directly in the front.  He wanted her to see how eager he was to learn. . . Even if he really did't like school.

The lesson was taught and once again, Hiro was on the verge of falling asleep.  He had gotten everything much faster then a lot of the other kids in his class.  He sat there, yawining and flipping his pencil around in between his fingers.  He heard the bell and collected all of his stuff.  He smiled and waved at the instructor.  "Bye!  See you tomorrow!"  * - Fri Dec  4 18:17:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: M'kay~ - Fri Dec  4 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We'll start with Suiton, as its my worst element. - Fri Dec  4 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Wait. . You know Suiton Auntie? - Fri Dec  4 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah. - Fri Dec  4 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Wait I can join? - Fri Dec  4 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sure. - Fri Dec  4 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Yessssssss. - Fri Dec  4 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) runs over to Green's side.* - Fri Dec  4 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled and did the same exact seals.  He then spit out the same stream of water tha she did.  It was very clean and precise, but not as strong as hers.

"I know that one already Auntie."  He would say with a smile.* - Fri Dec  4 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You do? Alright, a different one for you then. - Fri Dec  4 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Wait. First. What do you know? - Fri Dec  4 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *laughs*  That's it. - Fri Dec  4 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. - Fri Dec  4 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Then we go with the logical next steep up from that. - Fri Dec  4 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Great! - Fri Dec  4 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Right! - Fri Dec  4 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) watched Lera closely, memorizing the single seal that she had put up.  That part wasn't hard.  He put up the sign and started to focus his chakra.  He kneaded all of the Suitonic chakra he could inside of himself.  He tried to do everything the same as the Watergun jutsu.  She said they were similar.  He felt like he was about to do something and took a quick breath.  Bringing his hand up to his mouth, he shot out a stream of water. . . too bad it was the same jutsu he had just did.  

"Damn. . .Need more focus. . "* - Fri Dec  4 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *looks over at Kaiko*  Hey, I still don't know your name. - Fri Dec  4 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: I'll practice while I wait for her. . .  - Fri Dec  4 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiko(Lostlolidragon) says: I am the super amazing Kaiko! Bringing of water!  - Fri Dec  4 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Keep trying kid. - Fri Dec  4 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You'll get it. - Fri Dec  4 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Wait.. what? - Fri Dec  4 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Uh.. right - Fri Dec  4 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) tried it again.  He was not going to let the failure stop him.  He put up the seal, and took a deep breath.  He was determined that he was going to be able to put more pressure behind the water this time.  Just as he was about to release it, he heard Kaiko's answer.  He spit out basically a single glob of water and looked at her.

"You bring water?"  He says wiping the water from his mouth, confused.* - Fri Dec  4 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) refocused as he continued to listen to Kaiko and train at the same time.  She had caught him a little by surprise, but he was not going to let it stop him.  He put up the seal again.  He started to motivate himself mentally.  "Come on Hiro, it only has ine seal.  The jutsu cannot be that hard.  You just have to put some gusto into it.  You got this."  He would gather his chakra and spew out another attempt at performing the jutsu.  The waters volume did indeed increase this time, but it was not enough.

"That is a start."  He would say with a smile.  "Baby steps.  Baby steps."  He tried it again.  With every attempt he seemed to get a little better.  The chakra started to move within his body as he put up the seal and inhaled all of the air around him.  With one solid exhale, he would spew out the most powerful stream since he had started.  He knew it wasn't completed, but he was still happy.  "Auntie. . What else do I need to do to get this?  I feel like I am getting close, but I am not there yet."* - Fri Dec  4 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Chakra is the key. - Fri Dec  4 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: More chakra equals more volume. - Fri Dec  4 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: More chakra huh? - Fri Dec  4 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But if you can't hold that much chakra at once, then you need to practice control. - Fri Dec  4 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I think I can do it. - Fri Dec  4 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would keep what Lera had said in mind as he started to knead his chakra one again.  He could feel it flowing through his body as he held the sign.  "More. . More chakra."  He would think to himself.  A surge of chakra would pulse through his body.  This was the first time that he had ever concentrated his chakra to this extent.  He was not used to it just yet.  He attempted to spit out a powerful stream of water, but he couldn't control his chakra all that much as of right now.  It was too much for him to handle.  Instead of water, he just blew out a bunch of hot air.  ". . . . What the hell was that?"

He shook his head and tried not to get discouraged.  He was not going to let a jutsu beat him.  He looked over to see Green actually pull of the other jutsu.  He was proud of his little bro.  Seeing that inspired him even more.  He was not going to let his bro down.  He gathered all of the chakra he could inside of himself.  He sat there, kneading it all into one giant ball inside of himself.  He inhaled, then spewed out a powerful stream of water.  The water would soak the sand, only for an instant.  It was hot as hell and he was not the best when it came to ninjutsu.  "Haha yesssssss."* - Fri Dec  4 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright...Looking good~ - Fri Dec  4 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *totally can see that ghost* - Fri Dec  4 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright....wanna do another? - Fri Dec  4 19:38:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Sure~ - Fri Dec  4 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. Wind this time for you Hiro and clones for you Hiroshi. - Fri Dec  4 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: I got chakra for days~ *nods* - Fri Dec  4 19:39:18 2015
