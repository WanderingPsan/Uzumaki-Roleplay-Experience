<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) sighed and slowly made his way across from Saeza.  "I do have a name besides blue boy you know?"* - Tue Oct 13 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: He means over the entire wipe like..Last we were here, Noriko and Tethys were alive and stuff  - Tue Oct 13 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looked at Saeza a little funny

"Why the hell did she put a sword in her mouth?  Is that even a thing?  You know what?. . . O well I will just have to find a way to do something about it.  Then again. . . I thought this was a spar?"  He thinks to himself.

"You are taking this pretty serious I see.  Thanks a lot Sanoke.  Here I come Saeza."

Hiroshi ran over at Saeza as fast as he could.   He was not going to fight blind, he was going to try and use his head.  So just as he got close he put his hands together into a single hand seal and slipped into the ground to try and figure out how to deal with the long, pointy objects.* - Tue Oct 13 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hey, there Sanoke have you seen Mirai? - Tue Oct 13 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Probably at the house. Do you need her? - Tue Oct 13 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yes it's pretty urgent. - Tue Oct 13 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was clearly out of his league when it came to the speed department here.  So just as he put his hands together he was struck in multiple places and dropped down to a knee.  "Damn. . . She is fast."  

He would turn and look at her, still on his knee, holding various places on his body with his two hands.  He only had two so he just kept on moving them to the spots as needed.  Since she had created a little distance between the two of them, Hiroshi would try a different approach.  If he wanted to even land a hit he had to use every once of brain muscle that he had.  If not this would be a very one sided spar.  

Hiroshi reached into his pouch and pulld out a single smoke bomb.   He would hold his breath and throw it straight down onto the ground to createa  apuff of smoke around himself, and depending on where Saeza is, her as well.  He would then use this smokey sheild to put his hands together and slip into the ground, trying to gain any edge that he could.* - Tue Oct 13 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not pleased in the slightest by Saeza's comments.  

"I'm a bitch huh?  I got her bitch alright.  This is either going to be really good or really bad. . . let's hope for the best." He thinks to himself.

Using the earth's magnetic forces to find Saeze above ground, he would quickly move to her location.  He wanted to use the element of surprise, that was the only chance he had.  She was simply to fast for him.  He resurfaced directly in beside her, with that bitch comment still fresh in his mind.  The sheer force of her words ringing through his ears.  He would then quickly lean in and deliver a devestatingly, powerful. . .kiss on the cheek to try and fluster her, even if it was just a bit.  He was clearly running out of ideas here, plus she came at his manhood . . .Soooooooo.* - Tue Oct 13 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) wasn't really sure what was going on, it all happened way to fast.  He knew that he had kissed her, but that was in hopes of giving himself an opening.  Clearly that didn't work.  All of a sudden he felt a pinch on his neck and then felt the blood oozing from his neck into Saeza.  Just as he was about to let out a slight yelp from the initial bite, he suddenly felt a pleasure like no other come over himelf.  If this was going to do any more damage, he didn't care, he was in a state of pure bliss.  Then, it stopped and Saeza was running away.  He grabbed his neck and reached out to Saeza.

"Wait. . . What the hell did you just do?"

Then Sanoke came into the picture and stopped her from running. 

"Good, onw she can't leave. . . I think."* - Tue Oct 13 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: What the hell is going on here? - Tue Oct 13 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: The perv. . He's probably like. . . 'O-Oh. This feels so good. . ' - Tue Oct 13 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) instantly wipeed that look off of his face.

"Uh. . . .Umm. . .Yea it's cool Sanoke."

He then felt pretty responsible for her crying and waled over to her and extended a hand to try and help her up.

"Sorry. . . This is my fault, made a dumbass decision.  Please stop crying. . . I feel terrible."* - Tue Oct 13 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: If that is what it feels like to get bitten. . . . . I've been missing out, big time. - Tue Oct 13 06:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was still not sure what to do to get her to stop crying, but he couldn't take the fact that she was crying, it was killing him on the inside.

"Your not a monster. . .You are just a young lady that was kissed by a dumbass that made you act in a way that you would not normally act if you were not put in that situation.  If anybody is a monster here, it is me for putting you through this.  Once again, I am sorry, please stop crying. . . I'm begging you here."* - Tue Oct 13 06:10:20 2015

"You know what. . . . I can't really tell you why I became a shinobi at the moment.  I honestly was just going with the flow the entire time.  All of the kids my age, plus all of my friends were going to the academy so I said -what the hell-  I will go too.  Now I am here.   I don't remember crafting any nindo while I was at the academy however.  All I remember is sitting behind a desk and learning the basics.  Which most of it was common sense or just something else pretty easy for me to learn and handle."* - Tue Oct 13 08:12:22 2015

  Hiroshi would dash off towards Index, ready to make the first move.  Hiroshi was faster then the avarage genin, but still not anything special.  He had no idea of what Index's abilities were, so he was just going to try a straight forward approach for right now.  He ran with each of his hands clinched tightly into fists.  Assuming that Index did not make any immediate movements before Hiroshi got there, he would attempt a simple right jab aimed at Indexes left cheek.  * - Tue Oct 13 22:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Ummm....Sure we can do that.. Hey Bryson come with use since like you the Medic healr guy just in case you know. - Wed Oct 14 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Ok I will follow - Wed Oct 14 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Ok lead the way. - Wed Oct 14 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Well I asked you so you can have the first move sir. - Wed Oct 14 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was standing there casually, like he usually is, but he was still in a stance to be able to defend himself. This was his idea after all, time to see what he could do.  As he watched Trilliam made various hand seals to do various things that interesting HIroshi, but now wasn't the time for that.  As he saw the clone appear and start to do things he jumped into action.

Hiroshi darted off to the side to avoid the mud.  Just as he thought he was clear he saw a baragge of rocks flying his way, he was agile, but not that damn agile.  He started to twist and turn to avoid as many rocks a s he could, he dodged a few, but was caught by one on his arm.  This knocked hims slightly off balance and he stumbled.  This allowed the other rocks to hit him and kncok him to his but.  "Ow that hurt. . . "

He would stand up and bruch himself off. He would get back into his fighting stance ready for the next attack.* - Wed Oct 14 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would collect himself just in time.  As soon as he was on his feet the clone would make its way back at him attacking.  Hiroshi effortlessly dodged the clones attacks with his impressive reflexes, but that wasn't all that was going on.  HIroshi caught wind of some stones flying his way and was not about to let them hit him again.  He would spin and perform a solid kick at the clone, driving him into the oncoming rocks, in hopes that it would stop their progress.   If this was successful he would notice that Trill was gone and start to think.

"Where is he at?  Up, no he can't fly.  He just asked that Kilm dude about that.  No trees here so he isn't in one obviously.  He must be underground. . . Shit. . . I don't know exactly where he is. . . Damn. . .Glad I am smart."  He thinks to himself.  He would then put his hands together into a single seal and slip into the ground.  He was hoping he would run into Trill, maybe he would, maybe he wouldn't.  Trilliam might even see him before HIroshi sees Trill.  Oohhhhh the possibilities.* - Wed Oct 14 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Damn you. . . I ain't Smith lol0 - Wed Oct 14 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) went under looking for Trilliam, but he found nothing.  He was not sure what was going on, but he did not give up hope.  He belived in his brain.  He looked around under there and noticed that there were two clones coming at him.  He was sure that he took them out, but shit happens.  He would resurface and throw up his hands, while running.  

"You got it Trill.  I have some questions for you, but first call off your clones bro."* - Wed Oct 14 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Yea. . . For you. - Wed Oct 14 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Anyway how did you make that clone? - Wed Oct 14 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Huh oh its easy  every easy. - Wed Oct 14 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Really? - Wed Oct 14 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Think you could show me? - Wed Oct 14 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Do you have any injuries? - Wed Oct 14 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Just some scrtaches here and there I'll be fine. - Wed Oct 14 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) catches scroll.

"Thanks, I will return this too you as soon as I learn it."* - Wed Oct 14 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Naa keep it. - Wed Oct 14 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: You sure? - Wed Oct 14 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: All right... - Wed Oct 14 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I don't think we have met sir. - Wed Oct 14 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I mean I don't remember meeting you at least. - Wed Oct 14 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: And I wouldn't forget that soooooo. . . . - Wed Oct 14 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Oh, people. - Wed Oct 14 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Morning. - Thu Oct 15 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Hey there. - Thu Oct 15 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Kat, You up to train? I was finally given something to do in terms of Fuuinjutsu. - Thu Oct 15 17:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked around the Village hidden in the sand and saw the village residents each doing their own thing.  Some people were training, some were about to train, some were just standing, others were napping.  HIroshi decided to join the training group and wandered off into the distance, going towards the outskirts of the village.  He found a nice rock and hopped ontop of it.  He sat down and dug in his infinite pouch he kept with him.  He pulled out the scroll that Trilliam had given him and decided it was time to sit down and learn this thing.  Being that he was a really smart guy it shouldn't take too long.  He opened it up and started reading.

Hiroshi was picking up the jutsu quickly, as expected.  Even though he didn't really show it too much, he was a really smart guy.  Some might even call him a genius of sorts, but he didn't let that go to his head.  To much thinking was bad for the brain, that was his logic and he was sticking with it.  He just made sure that when he did use his brain, he used his brain.  That helped him catch people off guard and all sorts of things.  Still he might have been picking up the jutsu quickly, but he hadn't learned it just yet, so he kept on studying.* - Thu Oct 15 18:07:08 2015
