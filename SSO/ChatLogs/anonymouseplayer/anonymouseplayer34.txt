<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looked at her with a confused face.

"Whaaaa?  I just wanted you to become Kinami Hideo.  That is all.  Is it so wrong for me to want my woman to take my last name?  I really didn't mean to make you upset, I was just being honest with you."* - Tue Dec  8 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Fine. Just don't take that tone with me again, okay? - Tue Dec  8 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) nodded his head as he stood up and extended his arms for a hug.  He started to speak as he did so.

"Alright baby.  I really didn't mean to sound like an asshole there.  I just wanted to keep my family alive.  I am an only child and all I had was my mom and dad.  My mom has passed on now and it is just me and my dad.  I wanted to keep the Hideo name alive.  Now, can I have a hug please?"* - Tue Dec  8 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) kissed her on the forhead and started to speak.

"Alright baby.  When are we goign to have kids though?"  Then what she said finally hit home.  The words present started to ring throughout his head.  He quickly changed the subject to that present.

"A present?  Oh man, I can't wait.  I won't even ask you any questions, I will just let it be a surprise."  he got a broad smile on his face as he started to think about the possibilities.* - Tue Dec  8 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Haha, I bet you can't wait.~ - Tue Dec  8 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) he releases her and walks past her, slapping her butt as he passed.  He started to get dressed.

"Come on, lets go get some training done."  He said with a smile.* - Tue Dec  8 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) stood there, smiling.  He was in heaven.  As her bare chest pressed against his back, he could feel everything.  The shape, the feel, her nips, everything.  He loved everything about it.  Then, he felt a hand come unto his member and start to stroke it.  He relaxed as he accepted the feeling of pleasure starting to overcome his body.

"Is it time for that present already baby?"  He would say in a seductive voice.* - Tue Dec  8 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not ready for this.  He was serious about the going to train thing, but this was so much better.  He felt her soft, warm tongue lick the tip of his penis.  His knees gave out and he fell into the couch.  He smiled at her, he was enjoying his present.* - Tue Dec  8 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was completely at her mercy.  He leaned back into the chair and tilted his head back, closing his eyes.  He was in heaven, he wanted this to last forever.  He started to let out a slight moan and slowly started to speak as she went to work.

"This is amazing Nami. . . Oh man. . Your going too fast.  I can't hold back much longer. . "  He says, his face starting to turn a slight red color as his muscles started to tighten up.* - Tue Dec  8 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thought that he was in a state of pure bliss before.  This was something that he had never felt before.  He was trying his best to hold his lead back.  He had fought it for as long as she could.  She picked up the intensity and that was all she wrote.  He started to try and let her know what was about to happen.

"Nami. . ..I-I'm about to. . C-. . ."  He could not get the last words out.  He grabbed her head and started to move his hips.   He had lost the battle with himself and felt it all starting to pour out of him.  His entire load started to pump into Nami's mouth as he sat there, a looke of pure pleasure on his face.* - Tue Dec  8 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would rub the back of his head and blush a little.  

"I'm sorry Nami.  I lost control there for a second.  You are really good at that I see.  But, now it is my turn."  He quickly went over and scooped her up, then placed her on the chair.  He spread her legs apart and gazed into her Vagina.  He then slowly inserted only his index finger for now.  He moved it back and forth, slowly.  His finger was covered in her secretions as a lewd sound started to come from it.  He smiled as he looked to see how she was reacting to this.* - Tue Dec  8 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would smile as she was clearly starting to feel it.  He continued to slide his finger in and out, slowly.  He would then lift up his free left hand and start to fondle her breasts.  That too, started to happen slowly.  He moved from breast to breast, going from grabbing the entire boob, to just slightly pinching her erect nipples.  

After a short amount of time, he slowly inserted his middle finger into her as well as his index.  He picked up the pace at which he was moving his hand.  He leaned in, and slowly stuck his tongue out.  He started to lightly lick her clit, as he continued to pick up the pace with his hand.

"You will be, just give me a little time down here.  You will be just fine!~"  He would say in between licks.* - Tue Dec  8 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would smile and and lean up.  He kept his two fingers sliding in and out of her, now going as fast as he possibly could.  He would lean over her, and slowly place his tongue of her right breast.  He placed it on her aereola and started to move his tongue in a circle around her nipple.  After a few circles, he would move on to her nipple itself.  He flicked it a few times with his tongue, and then wrapped his entire  mouth around it.  Sucking on it, hard.  His tounge, moving all around it as her nipple was firmly in his mouth.  He would move back and lightly bit her nipple with his front teeth.  

Meanwhile, his left hand was still going to work on her left breast.  Still fondling it and playing around with it.  He talked with his mouth full of her breast, she could feel his breath as he spoke.

"Don't be embarrassed baby.  Everything about you is beautiful.  Just relax, Hiro's gotcha."* - Tue Dec  8 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had finally accomplishedwhat he was gong for.  With one final lick of her vagina, her joices started to spray in hie face.  He leaned back at first, it caught him a bit off guard.   He continued to move his fingers inside of her until the flow of he climax stopped.  He smiled at her and started to speak.


"I told you to relax.  Look at that I made you come.  But, we aren't done yet.  This is only the beggining."

He scooped her up again and placed her in his lap.  He then proceeded to attack her breasts.  He squeezed both of them with each hand.  Her nipples bing the only thing that was not being covered by his hands.  He leaned in, brought in each of her boobs close, and started to suck on them both at the same time.  His rock solid member twitching against her bare ass at this point.
* - Tue Dec  8 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would smile at her.  He was still rock solid, but that was ok for now.  He had satisfied his woman.  He allowed her to back off as he sat there with a smile.  He opened his arms, inviting her to come back.

"Alright baby.  Just come back here, let me hold you for a while.  Then we can leave ok?"* - Tue Dec  8 07:51:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked into his house and into the corner.  He was about to do a little exercise in the comfort of his own home.  He started off with getting into his fighting stance.  He then started to unleash a series of kicks in front of him.  A gust satered to fill the room as he continued to perform kick after kick.  He flipped af ew times in the air and then landed on his feet.  He wasn't about to mess up his home.

He got ready to do this all again.  HIs mind going off into imagination land as he started to move his body.  "I have toreach the second gate huh?  I have some work I need to do.  I will not let that bastard stay ahead of me.  Plus, my baby even told me to do it, so it is something that is going to get done."  He hit thr floor and stretched himself out a bit.

HE started to imagine himself doing the jutsu again.  ONly this time, he was going to do a few exercises.  His mental version doing his kicks, as he himself, was slowly lowering himslef to a push up position.  He had his shell on, making everything harder, but, he still needed something to push him besides a simple push up.

Hiroshi placed his hands together, forming the shape of a diamond with them.  He straightened himself out, until he was perfectly parallel with the ground.  His toes the only thing on his feet that were in contact with the ground.  He smiled at the ground as he worked out the jutsu mentally.  "Ok. . Let's get this show on the road.

Down Hiro went, slowly.  The weight of his shell trying to make him fall down even faster.  HIs muscles in his arms starting to activate as he made sure that his body went down slower then it wanted to.  He reached the point where his nose was barely touching the floor of his home.  He held that position for the time being.  Pushing himself, while still practicing Leaf Great Whirlwind mentally.

After he had held the positin for a decent amount of time, he finally started to push against the floor.  As he pushed, his body slowly started to return to the original position that he had started in.  His arms slowly extending out until the are fully extended.  He bent them again slightly and then pushed against the floor, as hard as he could.  He flew up clapped his hands.  Quickly, he put his hands back down into the diamond position.

Back in position for his push ups, he once again started to lower himself towards the ground.  His muscles starting to feel the burn of being pushed.  Everything from his pectorals and the muscles throughout his arms, activating to help him support his weight as he went down.  He reached the 90 degree point once again, frabric from the carpet lightly tickling his nose.  A bead of sweat dripped off of his face into the ground.  "Damn. . This shell."

Started to rise back up, as he thought about various things.  "hmmm, I wonder when i am going to have my first kid.  My boy Sanoke already has two.  Heheheh I think I would be a good dad.  Well, at least I think so.  Eh, Nami wil be there too, plus Green.  My kid will have a lot of support around it.  It takes a village."  He reached the starting position and placed his left hand behind his back.

he repositioned himself so he could balance and support his entire body with just one hand, his dominant right hand.  The singular hand had been placed directly in the middle of his chest, but on the ground.  This was the best way for him to support himself with the extra weight of the shell.  HE started to go down, with one hand.  This was the hardest of the psh-ups he had done.  "*pant* *pant*. . . I need stamina."

He started to go up, as he thought about what his sensei was doing.  She had been extremely busy, and he was sure that she would be happy with his progress.  He had come a lng wat from where he had started.  He still remembered being the lowly genin fighting with Sae all of the time.  He remembered Mari-Sensei as she taught him various jutsu.  He smiled as he continued to pump out push up after push up with just his right hand.

Hiro switched hands, now using his off left hand to perform the push ups.  This was going to be he hardest thing that he had done yet.  He continued to visualize himelf using his new taijutsu.  He needed to get it under wraps as he worked towards the second gate.  Up and down he went at a steady pace.  He was really putting in some work.

Now, having done around 50 pushups with each hand, and about 50 more in the diamond shape, he place both hands on the ground again.  He then pused off of th ground with his feet and placed his feet straight in the air.  He was now doing a complete handstand in the middle of the floor.  Sweat dripped from his face, drop after drop.  He held the position for now, catching his breath for a second while still picturing the end result of all of his training.

IN the handstand position, he started to perform vertical push ups.  This was more extensive then regular push ups. All of his body weight now being supported by only hi ams.  He could feel everybit of weight on him.  From his own weight, to the damn shell.  This shell had helped him out a lot, but that shit still got annoying.  He performed a few and then fell onto his back.  He was done for now, but he was tired as hell.* - Tue Dec  8 20:46:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) turned to the rock behind them that for some reason never got destroyed after one of them destroyed it, buuuuttt that is a story for another day.  He got into his fighting stance and started to stretch a bit while he spoke to Gravel.  

"Ok Gravel, this is literally just a glorified jump kick to somebody's face.  It sounds like it isn't too much, but when used correctly, this jutsu can e quite powerful.  You simply jump into the air, control your center of gravity, and perform a flying kick.  That is the entire thing.  I will show you on the rock right here in front of me."

He finished his stretching and started to run lightly towards the rock.  He jumped up and performed a mighty flying kick to the rock.  Bursting it into hundereds of tiny pieces as he flew through to the other side.  He walked over to Gravel and folded is arms.

"Now get too it.  You aren't going to learn anything just standing there."* - Tue Dec  8 21:10:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) nodded his head.

"Alright Gravel.  That technique was extremely easy, the next one you learn will be a little harder.  I will tell you know though, I am not going to go easy on you just because you are Geo's brother.  To be perfectly honest, That might cause me to be a little harder on you then I would others.  You ok with that?  Speak now or forever hold your peace."* - Tue Dec  8 21:21:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: Wow..that's pretty big. - Tue Dec  8 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) took a step back, still holding his throat.  He shook his head to get the cobwebs out and then got into his fighting position.  He then started to imagine a fight taking place.  He effortlessly knocked way the attack and proceeded to throw a strike directly at their throat.  They had the same reaction that he had.

He looked at Geo and shook his head.  One minute this guy is on his ass for no reason.  The next, the seemed like they were actually close.  He was actually teaching him something.  Hiro was still performing the jutsu to the best of his ability.  He did not have them down just yet, but he was working on it.

The pretend battle continued to happen.  He was bobbing and weaving as the strikes come at him.  He took his right hand and knocked away the attack, throwing his opponent off guard.  He followed up with the same strike to the throat.  This was all getting a bit better.

Hiro was getting a grip on how to do both of these.  They were really not that hard, but very useful.  He couldn't wait to actualy learn them so he coudl try them in battle.  "This is going to be very useful someday."

The battle continued, Hiro surrounded by countless enemies.  He calmly kept his eys moving, keeping tabs on each of them.  They attacked, he jumped over the pile.  He landed on his feet away from the pile as they started to come at him.  One by one he continued to knock away their strikes and chop them in their throats.

He had finally learned them* - Tue Dec  8 21:48:09 2015
