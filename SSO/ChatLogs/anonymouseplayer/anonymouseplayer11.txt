<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had finally met the person that Mari-Sensei was talking about, Pai-Sensei.  She wasn't what he expected to see.  Anyway she had given him his first test and he needed to finish this task in an a certain amount of time.  But before he left he wanted to do a little training.  He didn't know what was going to happen while he was out there.   Plus he wasn't even sure if he could leave the village, but he wasn't going to let that stop him from accomplishing his goal.  Plus if he didn't do it it would make Mari-Sensei look bad and he couldn't do that.  He  had all of these thoughts flowing through his head as he pulled out his tonto.  He then focused his chakra into the blade, increasing the blades offensive capabilities.  He continued to course his chakra through the blade.

HIs chakra was pouring through the blade.  HIs wind chakra that is.  The blade looked as if it had a blue jacket on.  He stood there swinging the blade back and forth with the limited amount of kenjutsu skill that he had.  With each slash the chakra would continue grind against each other making a slight Ziiiiiiinnnng sound.

This jutsu was starting to get a bit draining.  This was the longest that he had ever held it.  He usually just let it go after a slash or two.  But this time he wanted to see how long he could keep it up.  He never knew when he was going to need to hold it.  So he kept on holding it.

"This is nothing. I can do this all day.  If I can't do this I will never do what I want.  I have to get stronger."  As he said this the chakra surrounding the blade surged.  His determination causin his focus to go up and enhance his chakra control.  

This was it.  He had reached his limit.  He had held it for a while and now it was fizzing out.  The slight zing sound that was once there was now a pitiful hum.  He swung one last time and cut it off.  He bent over panting, sweat dripping from his forehead.  He sat down on the ground and looked up into the sky.  He put his fist up into the air and smiled.  "I'm gonna get stronger for the both of us. . . "* - Fri Nov 13 22:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had began his mini journey to find this peculiar rock that Pai-Sensei wanted him to find.  The rocked looked like no other rock he had ever seen before.  So once he saw it, he would recognize it with no problem at all.  As he reached the outskirts of the village hidden in the sand he turned back to look at the village.  "I will be back soon.  I won't let this little test be the reason that I can't accomplish my goals.  Fuck that."  He would smile and then continue on his way.

He head off in the northeastern direction.  Mor or less he was heading to Konoha, but he didn't know that.  He was just goingin the direction the he thought would be the best.  This was the first time that he had ever been outside of ihs home and he was actually enjoying the change of scenerey.  He stopped for a little while to relax a bit.  And the way he relaxed was to train.  * - Mon Nov 16 01:33:00 2015
