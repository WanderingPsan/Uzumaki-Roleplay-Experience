<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was doing the same thing as Shin.  Watching closely trying to soak up as much informations as he could.  Not only was this a good opportunity to see what Yan could do, but also a chance for Hiroshi to grow as a shinobi.  All things are not leanred simply by diving head first into them.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would smile and nod his head.  He had no problem taking the first move.  He darted off towards Shin with impressive speed.  He wanted to see if he could win an up close and personal battle.  When he got within range he would throw a simple right hook to see how this battle was going to go.

"Let's see how this works before I move on to something else."  He thinks to himself.* - Tue Nov  3 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was met only with a block.  He really wasn't expecting that, but he wasn't going to let that stop his attacks.  He would quickly transition into a left roundhouse kick aimed at Shin's right cheek.  This was more of a set up, as soon as the hih kick was thrown he would continue to spina nd chain it into a swift sweeping low kick aiming to take Shin off of his feet.  He would end the combination of kicks with a final right push kick aimed at Shin's mid-section.  He had hoped that hte final kick would send him back a few feet.  * - Tue Nov  3 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would be thrown off slighlty from this action.  He stumbled a bit but quickly recovered.  He was familiar with the technique as he could use it himself.   He would slip into the ground after Shin.  He wasn't sure exactly where he was at first but after he settled down a bit he quickly locked onto his location.  He charged in that direction in hopes of getting to Shin before he realized what exactly was going on.  If he did he would simply just attempt to grab Shina nd resurface with him in hand. * - Tue Nov  3 05:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not able to get to Shin fast enough due to his stumble.  As he was going for him Shin resurface of his own free will and then all of a sudden Hiroshi could not sense where he was anymore.  Immediiately he woud resurface and look to see if he could find where Shin was.  He saw Shin and a few unexpected Shins.  He didn't know which one was the real Shin and which one was not.  But he knew that one of them were real.  So without putting much more thought into this entire situation he quickly performed 3 hand seals.  Dog! Rabbit! Snake!  Then a clap of his hands.  This would call forth a mighty wind that was meant to try and send Shin and his clones flying into the wall behind him.* - Tue Nov  3 05:36:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) thinks: He looks cool as hell...I wonder if I'll get a cool eyepatch~ - Tue Nov  3 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had once again been in this situation where a fellow sparring member decided to take advantage of his wind with some fire.

"Shit. . . Why do I only seem to spar Katon users?  Damnit Hiroshi."  He would think to himself.  He only had one chance to try and get away from this and it would leave him wide open for a second, he just had to hope the he was able to get far enough away to recover.  He put his hands up into a single Tiger seal and then seemingly disappeared.  But in reality he was just moving really really fast.  

If he was able to get away he would be standing aroud 3 paces to the south, hoping he could avoid most, if not all of the flames and rocks.

If not, well then that might be pretty bad.* - Tue Nov  3 05:49:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was immediately regretting the decision to use shunshin when he knew that he was not the best at using it.  He fell to his knee as everything around him seemed to spin at an alarming speed.   As if this wasn't enough, he would be surrounded by a multitude of clones.  He looked around at each of the clones, still kind of dazed, and knew that he was in a bit of a situation.  To make things worse these things weren't even real, this was all just a genjutsu that Hiro was not even able to recognize.  Being in the physical state that he was in at the moment he really couldn't do too much.  He tried to stand up and move quickly, but he fell to his but since he had not fully recovered.

"Shit. . .This is bad. . . How did he make so many damn clones anyway?  What kind of chakra does Shin possess?  Damn. . . They are going to whip my ass."  He thinks to himself as he strugles to collect himself.* - Tue Nov  3 06:04:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was getting hit from the left and from the right.  He was finally starting to get himself together, but these hits were adding up.  They weren't too powerful but they are starting to rally pile on.  Hiroshi was getting tired of all of these damn clones.  He would attempt to fight back the best he could.  As he would swing at one, he would be hit by another, and so on.  This continued for the time being, Hiroshi wasn't going down without a fight.* - Tue Nov  3 06:15:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was still trying to fight off the clones, then out of nowhere his left leg froze.  He was unable to move it no matter how hard he tried.  It was like the thing just quadrupled in weight, twice.  He tried and tried to move it, as he was getting hit by the clones he was then put in yet another situation.  Just as his Sensei before him, he was trapped in between rocks.  He had no idea what was going on right now.  He just sat there, trying to figure out what was going on.  This was a lot more then he could have ever hoped to imagine.* - Tue Nov  3 06:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) gave Shin a straight face.  He wasn't too happy about being a test subject, but what was he going to do about it now.  He couldn't move his leg, he was stuck in some rocks, and he totally had to scratch his arm but couldn't move to do it.  He sighed and started to speak.

"Well I am glad that I could help you out.  You helped me learn a lot too thanks.  This spar is over. . . You win.  Can you fix my leg and let me out of this little rock prison thingy?  My arm is itching like crazy."* - Tue Nov  3 06:38:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked up to his little training spot, fitting to do some more training.  He had been slacking lately and needed to get back into it.  After seeing that weird guy and Mari-Sensei in action it really made Hiroshi think about his own abilities.  He might have been young, but he was still a shinobi.  This meant that he might not get the chance to get better when he got older.  The getting older part might not ever happen.   He had just learned a brand new technique thanks to Yan and he wanted to get that one under his belt, before he did anything else.  So he started to focus on his Suitonic chakra and built it up.  He would  put up a seal and take a quick breath.  He would then shoot a soft stream of water at the wall.  He wasn't to great at it just yet, plus it was not that strong of a technique.

Hiro noded as he as at least able to use the jutsu effectively.  He knew that hte true strength in each and every jutsu is knowing when to use them.  This one would be no different, but he still needed to get better at it.  So he too a quick breath and spewed out some more water.  This was the most water he had seen in Suna since he been here.

"This seems like it might just make a lot of mud around here. . . I have a jutsu for that though.  Maybe I should think of a way to use this in conjuction with my mud to make it move even faster.  Or I could .. . "  He would stop mid sentence, as he had to use his mouth to use the jutsu again.

"Ok. . Maybe I could use this as a way to distract people.  Not everybody knows that I can use suiton.  I only told Yan and a few people were present.  the element of surprise is always good to have in your back pocket."  He would then spit out some more water. It was starting to make the dry landscape of Suna a little muddy.

Hiro used the jutsu one last time and then sat down.  He was going to relax and think about some things.  He really needed to get back to his old self.* - Wed Nov  4 15:21:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) sratched his head and turned it slightly to the side.

"Friend?  On your back?  How does he breath?  I see no holes in that thing."* - Wed Nov  4 15:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Mashai must be strong as shit to just carry people around on his back. - Wed Nov  4 15:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) 's confused look got even worse.  This was destroying his brain.

"He ain't human?  What?  Is it an animal?  Wait. . . They still have to breath. . . What?. . I- . . What?"* - Wed Nov  4 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) look of confusion was finally removed and he started to laugh.

"That makes so much more sense. . . Damn I sounded stupid. But that is awesome.  How log did it take you toe learn to do that. Oh, where are my mannors?  Hello Takuro."  He would say as he gave Takuro a nod * - Wed Nov  4 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was stuck in awe.  He thought that damn puppet was talking to him.

"Yo it can talk too?  And it sounds just like. . . Wait a minute.  That was you talking wasn't it?"  He would say with a bright smile.* - Wed Nov  4 16:11:56 2015
