<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was a bit at a loss for words in this situation.  It seemed as tho the two really just wanted some booty.  This entire situation was crazy as hell.  He was snapped back into reality with the hair shooting out towards Mitsunara.  He didn't know the extent of the hair's power, but he pulled out a tonto and started to surge his Wind natured chakra through it.  He attempted to cut the hair with a single slash, if that was possible.* - Fri Dec 11 23:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not able to fully slice through the hair, but it had retracted.  Before he knew it, there were more clones and hair coming his way.  "Shit. . "  He thought to himself.  Just as he thought that he was going to have to do something about the hair coming his way, Izanami handled the hair with a bunch of hot hot.  He smiled and focused on the clone's coming towards him.  They would not be as strong, or agile as the original.  So, he figured he woudl try and power throught hem with a series of kicks.  One for each of the clones.

The first clone would get a mighty high kick straight to the jaw, with all of Hiro's strength.  He spun and quickly continued the combination with a mighty sweeping kick to knock the clone off of it's feet.  Yet another Rotation would come forth and a mighty push kick would send the clone flying into the third one.  The combination would continue to happen as Hiro would throw yet another high kick towards the fourth clone.  For the last clone, he would simply use another middle kick to end the combination of kicks.  Hopefully, dispelling all of the clones with each of his mighty kicks.* - Sat Dec 12 00:26:49 2015

"Did this bastard just say that he wanted my booty?  Fuck that.  Congrats mister Booty hulk,  you won't have to deal with your lust for booty anymore.  You are going to die here now."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) made contact with his kick, but her swift movements made the damage a lot less then what it would have been originally.  Not only that, she also had found a way to send an attack at Oto.   He felt himself losing his balance a bit from her pushing him back.  With his impressive reflexes, he was able to place both hands on the ground behind him, stabalizing himself.  He hoped that she would have assumed that he was going to fall to his butt, so she woudl not be ready for his counter.  He used his arms as a balance, and sent a sweeping kick towards Nami's ankles.  Possibly making her fall instead of him.* - Sat Dec 12 15:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was punched in his chest with a good amount of force.  It still seemed like she wsa holding back, but it was still one hell of a punch.   He braced himself for the impact the best that he could as the fist connected with his chest.  He went sliding back on the sand a few feet and then grabbed his chest with a smile.  He then heard Oto's words and gave him a confused look.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) yawned one last time.  He wasn't bored or anything, he was just very relaxed.  He casually removed the shell from his back and let it fall to the ground with a solid thud.  He placed his left hand on hit right shoulder and started to rotate his right arm.  Stretching all fo the muscles in his arm to the best of hisi ability.  He woudl switch adn repeat the same process with the left arm.  He wiggled his legs a bit and finally got into his fighting stance, with a smile.  "Alright Geo.  Let's do this."

He darted off towards Geo, full speed ahead.  He knew that Geo was going to be abel to handle most of what he threw at him, but it was ok.  This was more for training then anything else.  As he ran towards Geo, he started to run in different directions.  Hoping that his speed would make it hard for Geo to keep up with him without some sort of advanced vision.  He still closed the gap between the oth of them fairly quickly, and once withing range, he started to launch his attack.

Once within striking distance, he would throw a mighty left high kick aimed towards his right temple.  While Geo was focused on that he attempted to sweep him with a sweeping right kick aimed towards his ankles.  Knowing that Geo was durable as a mofo, he spun one last time and attempted to throw a mighty push kick to Geo's gut to try and slide him back a step or two.  * - Sat Dec 12 21:28:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was able to land the hits, but they did next to nothing.  As to be expectied of Geo.  Hiroshi readied himself as Geo started to come back towards him.  Before he knew it, there were attacks coming at him this time.  Over the past year or so, Hiroshi had really been working on his reflexes.  To the point where he felt as if he could dodge just about anything that came his way, as long as he had some way to see what was going on.  Now, to deal with these punches.
 
The first punch was coming right for his face, not knowing that Geo was going to stop the attack short, he quickly leaned to his right to avoide the fist that he thought was coming for his face.  Then, a sudden gust of wind came shooting past his face.  His hair started to dance around as it if had a mind of it's own.  His eyse widened as a single thought came thourgh his head.  "What the hell was that?"

The next punch was coming for his gut.  He still was not aware that Geo was not going to physically make contact with him.  So he stepped a little further to his right, to avoid the oncoming punch towards his gut.  Then, he felt it again.  That gust of air coming past him.  He didn't have time to put too much thought into what was happeneing.  But the same thing went through his head.  "What the hell was that?"

Finally, the last attack came towards his legs.  He quickly jumped up and over Geo, landing behind him with a smile.  He didn't know what the hell Geo had going on just now, but he had a pretty good idea that Geo was somehow causing these gusts to come about.  He could not see them at all, even with his sight.  The only thing that saved him from this attack was the fact that Geo was right there in front of him and he avoided his fists.  Assuming that the air moves out in a straight line in front of the first, he should have been able to easily move out of harms way.

As soon as he landed onto the ground, attempted to throw a solid kick directly to the weak point of Geo's leg, the back of his knee, causing him to fall to at least one knee.  With the same foot, he would quickly aim to send a mighty side kick to Geo's face to send him toppling over to the ground, and possibly sliding on the sand.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was punched in the gut by Geo's massive uppercut before he was able to land and try his own attack.  He was currently flying through the air as of right now.  Not really much else he could do at this point.* - Sat Dec 12 22:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) heard Geo's words from under him and laughed.  He was in a tight spot here, not much that he could do, he had one idea, but it was a stretch.  He coated himself in his Doton chakra, without Geo being able to see anything.  He was good enough with thie technique that he needed no handseal.  He just coated himself without moving, while laughing.  "Do your worst Geo.  I kinda want to see what it is myself.  Let's see what happens buddy."  

He would then think to himself. "I hope this works, if not, this might end badly."* - Sat Dec 12 22:09:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was caught by a sudden change in plans.  He had surroinded himself in his chakra, but Geo had decided to fall to the ground before hand to depiver a massiv punch to his chin.  Everything went white upon impact as he was sent into the air again.  He wasn't unconcious or anything, but he was in quite a bit of pain.  He could barely think straight.  Before he knew it, Geo was coming back wraping himself around his body.  For some reason, people liked trying to drive Hiro into the ground headfirst.  He hit the ground and fell onto his face.  He struggled to roll over and look up to the sky, rubbing his head.
