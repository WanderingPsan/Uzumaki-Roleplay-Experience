<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was looking at Trilliam the entire time.  The moment he formed the hand seals, he formed the same hand seal and created two clones of his own.  The two clones ran at the other two clones and jumpe onto the other clones that Trill had made.  They were both totally demolished by the attack, but they still protected Hiroshi.  Mean while Hiroshi started to make his move.

Hiroshi ran around the clones that had protected him and closed the relatively small gap between himself and Trilliam, quickly.  He would get right up to him and attempt to throw a simple combination at him.  He started with a right hook aimed directly at Trill's gut with almost full force.  This would more then likely cause hims to bend over, as that happened HIroshi would throw a massive knee aimed at Trilliam's chin aimeing to send him flying through the air.* - Tue Oct 20 05:28:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would be grabbed, but not for long.  The instant he felt the hands he would quickly smack both of them away.  As the clones started to use the jutsu around him, he would put his hands together into a single seal and slip into the ground.  He would move behind Trilliam and pop up directly behind him and attempt to throw a mean ass kick aimed at the back of Trilliams head.* - Tue Oct 20 05:44:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would notice the lighting still surrounding Trill and stop his foot, inches from contact.  As he stopped the clones came at him once more.  Hiroshi would jump back and out of the way, knowing all two well what was going to happen if he let those clones grab him.  He would slide back a few feet, and hold his position.  He would put his hands together into another seal and make the two clones.  The clones are standing to each side of the real Hiroshi, but slightly in front.  The two clones would start a series of hand seals.   Meanwhile, Hiroshi would reach into his pouch, since Trilliam wasn't looking at him, and throw a smoke bomb directly beside Trilliam.  He was hoping the stun from the smoke would cause him to stop the jutsu.

The two clones would spit out two trails of ud in front of the clones that Trilliam had made, hoping to make them fall and cancel out their jutsus also.* - Tue Oct 20 05:57:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) //Hiroshi's clones would attempt to land the cruching blows to both of Trilliam's clones.  Not 100 percent sure if it was going to work, but optimistic.  They would both throw a massive stomp aimed at the clones throats.

Hiroshi knew that he couldn't see in the smoke.  So he put his hands together and slippied into the ground, to make sure that Trilliam was still in the same spot.  He would verifiy this and charge at him underground.  He would resurface directly in front of him and start to throw a series of punches.  He would end the punches with a final punch to the gut.  He would finish out the entire combo with a marshall law like backflip kick aimed with his toe going just under Trill's face.  He tried to send Trilliam flying through the air and out of the smoke. * - Tue Oct 20 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Stop the spar... - Tue Oct 20 06:29:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would be standing over top of Trilliam, breathing heavily, covered in sweat.  He had never worked that hard in a spar before and he was tired as shit.  At this point the smoke would have started to clear and everyone would see that Hiroshi had found a way to come out on top.  He wipes the sweat from his fore head and talks between the breaths.

"*huff*  I told you. . . *pant*  You ain't want it. . . "* - Tue Oct 20 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Hey I said stop this fighting... Iza calm down - Tue Oct 20 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looks at Izanami speeding his way.  He wasn't really sure what was going on, but the next thing he knew she was attcking him.  He was not in any shape to continue fighting, but he wasn't trying to just let himself get hit.  So he attempted to move out of the way, but he fell.  Then he would see Saeza come to the rescue.  He would smile.

"THanks. . . I owe you one."

He then turns to Bryson.

"Sorry Bry. . . Is he going to be alright?"* - Tue Oct 20 06:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked to the spot he seemed to fall in love with.  He knew that he needed to do some training.  Even if he did win his first ever spar, he needs to get stronger, a lot stronger.  He couldn't let this win go to his head.  Plus he had some jutsu and things that he needed to learn so that he could become even stronger.  For right now he was just going to focus on his HIde like a mole.   HE would put his hands together into a single seal and surround himself in his dotaonic chakra.  He would slip into the ground and move around down there for the hell of it.  He would rise back abouve the ground and look around, taking in all of the scenery around him. . . . . This place looked so depressing at the moment.

Hiroshi was still doing his traiining.  Training the same thing until he felt like he had it under wraps.  With his high inttelligence though he decided to try other ways of training.  Just popping in and out of the ground wa not something he was oing to make himself do over and over again. He looked at the gian wall in front of him and scratched his head.  "I wonder if this will work?  It should? one way to find out."  With that he would put his hands together into a seal snd sprint directly at the wall.  He had no intentions of stopping.  It was either run inside of the wall, or run into it. He made it too the wall and closed his eyes as he passed through it.  He opened them and realized that it workds and smile.  "Seems like it did work. NIce"* - Tue Oct 20 16:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked back out of the mountain and continued to train.  He wasn'tmaking the progress that he wanted.  He was making progress, but he felt as if he could be doing better.  HE sat down on the ground and ran through the jutsu in his head, slowly.  

"Ok so I do the hand seal and it surrounds me in my chakra.  That is extremely simple to understand.  As that happens I voluntarily slip into the earths surface.  This also makes a lot of sense.  So what part of this is holding me back?  What is the thing that makes me feel like I could do this so much better?  I need to figure that out.  If not, I will never get any better at this.  Let me try it for real instead of these simulations in my head."

He would stand to his feet and put his hands togehter into that single seal.  Enveloped in his chakra, he would slip into the earths surface and swim around down there.  He was still trying to figure out exactly what the issue was.  Right now it wsn't working.  So he ruseurfaced and went back to thinking.* - Tue Oct 20 16:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I want you to run through your wind jutsu for a moment while I get these two going. - Wed Oct 21 04:53:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: It's alot harder than I thought.. - Wed Oct 21 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) takes the leaf from Marissa and listens to her explenation of what was about to happen. Then shook his head upon her demonstration of the techinique.  He would take a step or two back and then attempt to cut the leaf just as Marissa did.  He placed the leaf between his palms and then attempted to gather his wind chakra.  He stood there a few seconds and opened his hands again.  NOthing happened.* - Wed Oct 21 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) scratched his head.  "What the hell?  She made it look so easy.  I thought that if I just put all of the chakra I could into it it would just rip like that. . . Damnit. . . Guess I have to try again."  He would think to himself.

Hiroshi would go throught he process once again.  Maybe this time he would make a little progress.  HE started to concentrate his chakra once more, trying to cut the leaf just as Marrisa did.  After a while of standing there trying to rip it he looked again. . . Still nothing.* - Wed Oct 21 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . . .  - Wed Oct 21 05:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) 's forehead would start to shine slightly from the sweat.  A single bead would trickle down his face and drip off of his chin.  He would wipe his chin with the back of his right hand.  He would then try this once more.  HE knew that he could not get frustrated or it could affect his progress.  He tried to think back on what Marissa had said, how the chakra came from lungs.  With this in mind Hiroshi would once again start to circulate chakra within his body.  He focused all of his chakra into the palms of his hand, trying to cut the leaf in half.  ONce again. . . He ain't do shit.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: The wind Nature is not as soft as you would expect - Wed Oct 21 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: It can be gentle, but it can also be stern. The wind will alwas want to work agasint you. . You must learn to work with it. .  - Wed Oct 21 05:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: That's great Iza!~ I knew you could do it. .  - Wed Oct 21 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) sat down on the ground and crossed his legs.  Bending his right arm at the elbow, he placed the elbow on his knee and his chin inbetween his fingers.  He sat there with his eyes closed thinking, yet listening to Marissa as she talked.  

"Ok. . I am clearly doing something wrong.  The wind wants to work against me does it?  I see how it is.  Thanks Marissa that might actually help.  Now to put what she said into action."  

HIroshi rose to his feet and attempted to cut the leaf again.  Keeping everything that Marissa had said in mind, he focused his chakra into trying to cut the leaf.  He opened his hands again, he at least made a slight rip into the leaf.* - Wed Oct 21 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: so I will start you off with Chakra flow.. You already know Chakra flow Fire. . So it should be an easy stepping stone into the world of wind jutsu - Wed Oct 21 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mmm, right. - Wed Oct 21 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled, but was still a little disatistfied with himself.  Just as he had made little progress Izanami over there had just cut the leaf.  He felt so defeated, but he wasn't about to show it.  He was actually pretty impressed with her though.  She had done it faster then he did, and he felt like he could learn things faster then most people.  He smiled at her as he placed the leaf between his hands again.

"Congrats Izanami!"

He would then once again try to cut the leaf in half.  The rip got slightly bigger, little more progress.* - Wed Oct 21 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: . . .  - Wed Oct 21 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Do you all think I'll be remembered when I die? - Wed Oct 21 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: What kinda question is that bitch? - Wed Oct 21 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) shook his head.  He was getting tired of doing this shit.  He wiped the sweat from his brow and went back at it.  Placing the leaf between his palms and keepig everything that had been stated in his mind as he did it, he tried again.  "Ok from my lungs, be the breeze, lets go."   He would put everything he had into cutting this leaf.  If it didn't work like this then he was going to have a problem.  HE then heard a rip and opened his hands, the leaf was in two.  He looked up at Marissa and smile.

"About time I did this!"* - Wed Oct 21 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Of course. I'll probably live long after you've died and I'll definitely remember you. - Wed Oct 21 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I'm sure you will be. - Wed Oct 21 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would take the scroll and smile.

"Thanks."

He sat down and opened up the scroll.  He wasn't too fond of reading, in fact he really hated it.  Even if he was a genius.  Still if that was what she thought was the best way to teach him, he would do it with no complaints.  When he opened it up he found that the scroll was very detailed and even had helpful hints.  "Damn this is descriptive."  He would think to himself as he read.* - Wed Oct 21 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) continued to read the scrol while conversing with the females present.  The informatin from the scroll flowing into his mind through his eyes, from the scroll, that came from Marissa. . . I don't know where it was before that.* - Wed Oct 21 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) yawned as he read the scroll.  He was bored as a mutha chuka,  reading this scroll.  But you gotta do what you gotta do.  So he kept on reading and studying the scroll.

Hiroshi stood up and stretched his legs.  The scroll falling from his hand to the ground.  "Oops."  He picked it back up and then sat back onto the sandy surface.  Going back to his torture.

The young Sunagakure shinobi was in full on learning mode.  HE was not moving from this spot until he had learned this jutsu.  Marissa took the time to help him so that was the least he could do.  So he kept on studying.

The scroll was very descriptive, and easy to understand for the most part.  Hiroshi had just not been focusing too much as he was reading.  So he refocused and read.

This was starting to make Hiroshi a little sleepy.  He yawned and rubbed his eyes.  He shook his head to try and get the cobwebs out and then forced himself to continue with his sudies.

Hiroshi looked up to see both Izanami and Saeza had learned their jutsu already.  ONce again he was being left behind.  He was smart, but apparently that wasn't helping at the moment.  He looked back down at his scroll.  "Congrats you two."* - Wed Oct 21 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was back to reading this scroll.  You have to do things you don't want to do to get to where you want to be.  HE finally put his all into treading this scroll and was able to get a basic concept of it.  At least enough to use the damn thing. 

"It's a start."  He would say with a smile* - Wed Oct 21 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Alright.  .onto a harder one Hideo - Wed Oct 21 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Bring it on. - Wed Oct 21 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: This one is called Wind style rotating shuriken - Wed Oct 21 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) took the scroll with a smile.  

"Thanks, really apprecieat this.  You didn't have to help me."* - Wed Oct 21 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Happy to do it. .  - Wed Oct 21 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) sat back onto the ground in the spot he had created for himself.  He opened the scroll and once again it was very detailed.  In the usual fasion, from left to right.  He would start to try and soak in the information.

Things were slowly starting to come together as he read the scroll.  This was a bit more difficult then the last one.

This reading thing was in the way, but Hiroshi was getting stronger.  The trade off was worth it, so he kept on reading.

Hiroshi keeps on reading the scroll, looking at all of the little side notes as well as the main information.  This was starting to make a little sense to him.

As he was reading the scroll he would slowly start to form the hand seals the scroll said were needed.  He had to move, he was getting tired of sitting still.

Hiroshi flipped over onto his stomach and placed the scroll directly on the ground.  He contined to read the damn thing.

He bent his knees and lifted his feet until the air.  He swung them back and forth like a little kid as he read. He was only 13 after all.* - Wed Oct 21 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) felt like he had a pretty good understanding of the jutsu now.  He stood up and tried it out.  It was weak but it was there.

"Alright. . . What's next Marri?"* - Wed Oct 21 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would take the scroll again.

"Thanks. I am learning a lot today."   He sat down and started to read the scroll closely soaking all the info that he could.* - Wed Oct 21 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: M'kay. - Wed Oct 21 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looked from the left to the right.  Reading each word, each collection of letters, every sentence, as if it were its own separate esssay.

This scroll was different the last ones that he had read.  Yet another wind technique that he could add to repetoire.  Too bad he like punching people better then blowing them away.  He was going to tell Marissa that though, he needed this stuff.

Hiroshi continued to force himself to read the scroll.  He started to perform the hand seals as he read.  At least he had that much down.

The 13 year old rolled over onto his back and lifted the the scroll into the air and continued to read.* - Wed Oct 21 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) another 5 rps* - Wed Oct 21 06:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Uhm...There's a loooong reason why I'd have to explain why you can't... - Wed Oct 21 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Short version is. . If I am not a part of the "I have fangs club" I can't join? - Wed Oct 21 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Get it** - Wed Oct 21 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: ....Short version is we're friends and I'd hate for you to have to kill me.... - Wed Oct 21 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Kill you? - Wed Oct 21 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Yeah....I'd have to sire you...Then you'd have to kill me or break my control... - Wed Oct 21 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am pretty strong willed. . but uh. .  - Wed Oct 21 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I'd rather not join the Fang association just yet. .  - Wed Oct 21 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: No offense intended. . but I can't see myself sucking blood. - Wed Oct 21 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) rose to his feet and opened the scroll.  He dusted himself off and started to gather his chakra.  He felt like he had enough of a grasp on the jutsu that he might be able to actually pull it off.  He started to gather his Wind natured chakra.  His hands in the basic Tiger! seal as he does so.  He would then quickly start to perform the seals for the jutsu.  Tiger! Ox! Dog! Rabbit! Snake!.  With the final Snake! seal locked in he went on the the execution of the jutsu.  In the usual Naruto like mannor he yelled out the technique like everybody can't see what the fuck they using. . . Sorry got a little upset. . Back to RP.  
"Wind Style: Great Breakthrough!"  He stood there for a second. . Nothing. . 
"Oops. . Thought I had it.  That's embarassing."  He woudl say with a laugh* - Wed Oct 21 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Let's get harder 'Risa! I know you have some powerful techniques hidden up your sleeve! - Wed Oct 21 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would refocus himself and repeat the process of what he just did.  H felt like he was on the right track.  O so close, yet still so far away.  This was not going to stop the young shinobi though.  As a matter of fact it inspired him.  He gathered his chakra once more, and then ran through the seals.  He would then yell out.

"Wind Style: Great Breakthrough!"  As he sad this a slight breeze would come blow.

"I did it. . . Thanks you the greatest."* - Wed Oct 21 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would watch on in awe as Marissa easily blew holes into the poor unsuspecting cactus.  He quickly opened the scroll and started reading.  He was clearly a lot more excited about this one then the others.* - Wed Oct 21 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) sat there reading the sroll. The image of the holes in the cactus exciting him.  He couldn't wait to try it himself.  He studied the scroll intently.  This was the first time that he was actually happy to be reading something. . . Heh who knew?

Hiroshi was completely engrossed in this scroll.  Something about this one was just clicking with him.  Everything about the idea of being able to spit bullets just made this pre teen giddy with excitement.  He hummed softely as he layed there reading the scroll.

Was still humming for a while but slowly changed it into words as he studied.  "Gonna spit bullets.~ Gonna spit bullet!~ Gonna spit bullets!~"  He slowly rose to his feet and brushed himself off.  He was tired of laying down.* - Wed Oct 21 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) started to run through the hand seals without looking at the scroll.  Trying to force himself to remember both the seals themselves and to get them comfortable to form.  He repeated the seals in order over, and over, and over, until it became basically second nature to him.  He would glance back at the scroll to make sure that he had everything all together.  He would then start to try and execute this jutsu.  He gathered his chakra and then flew through the seals.  He would take in a deep breath and then exhale. . Nothing but hot air.

Hiroshi did not let this failure get too him.  He knew that this thing happened to the best of us.  He would take a deep breath and collect himself.  He would then start to gather.  Putting together his hands into a single seal, the Bird! seal, he would feel things start to happen insid of hismelf.  HE would then exhale and send out a single puny bullet, but it was a start.  He turned to Marissa and smile.

"This is my favorite one so far."* - Wed Oct 21 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: It's all thanks to our wonderful teacher.~ - Wed Oct 21 07:06:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am happy to help. .  - Wed Oct 21 07:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would reach into his pouch and pull out a fresh flower he pulled off of da cactus that she had blew holes in.

"Thanks really.  This the best I can do for you right now. . . No money."  He says as he extends flower.* - Wed Oct 21 07:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looks at Marissa and then averts his eyes a little, he fce turning a slight red color.  This was unusual for him.  He would then try to speak.

"Ummm. . . Ma. . . Umm. . . I mean Mari. . . Umm. . damnit"* - Wed Oct 21 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Get yourself together Hiroshi. - Wed Oct 21 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: What's up Hideo? - Wed Oct 21 07:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) closed his eyes tightly and started to yell by accident.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked to his new favorite spot inside of the village.  It was the place that he always seemed to do his own little thing.  Thanks Marissa he had plenty of wind techniques under his belt.  Now he just had to get them together a little better so he could use them as well as she did.  But for now he would just read the scroll that he had with some taijutsu in it.  That was what he liked the best.  He opened up the scroll and sat down against the mountain and started studying.* - Wed Oct 21 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) , being the genius that he is, would learn the jutsu very quickly.  After that he would stand up and smile.  He was proud of himself.  He wasn't expecting to learn it so fast, but he did.  Now he could focus on his wind techniques.  He decided to try get the one that he liked the best so far under wraps, Wind Style: Air Bullet.  He started to gather his chakra for a genin he had massive reserves.  He might have been on par with a chuunin if he put a little more effort into it, o well.  He would then take a deep breath and lock in the bird seal.  Then, exhaling, he would send out 4 bullets of wind that would smack the walls and dissapate.  He wasn't too good with it yet so they didn't do to much damage to the rocks.* - Wed Oct 21 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled as the bullets hit the wall.  He really liked the idea that he could spit bullets.  It was better then having a gun, and as long as he had chakra he could do it whenever he wanted.  This technique would go great with his taijutsu.  He had some ideas, but he would save that for later.  For right now he needed to get this thing together.  He would use the jutsu once more, this was going to be hard, but he was ready.

Hiroshi knew that training wasn't just all about repeating the jutsu over and over again.  While that helped, it was good to do some visualization and making sure he had the basics down also.  So the basics was what he was going to do right now.  But first, he spat out a few more bullets.  The boy just couldn't help himself.

Stood there staring at the wall.  He knew that to get better at this jutsu he had to have the basics of it down pact.  He would slowly go through the entire thing.  First he thought on where Mari-Sensei had told him wind chakra was at, the lungs.  He then started to try to call upon said chakra in his lungs.  ONce he felt like he had done a good job of that he would go on to locking in the seal.  He wanted the bird seal to be etched so deep into his being that he might do it without thinking about it.  This took a while but he felt like he was getting it together.

After a while of locking in the Bird! seal, he moved on to the next phase.  Not only because he thought he had it, but his hands were hurting from the repeated use.  This jutsu required him to be able to take in air quickly and efficiently.  Other shinobi were not going to let him sit there and take his time breathing in.  He had to be able to breath in all the air he could in a matter of milliseconds.  So he started to breath in heavily and quickly to get this thing straight.  He would then unleash another barrage of bullets.* - Wed Oct 21 19:29:04 2015
