<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) put up the same seal that Lera had.  He focused on performing the simple clone technique, but trying to fill the clone with water.  He stood there, focusing, imagining the complete version of this technique.  He could see it now, a clone made of water would be so awesome.  He smiled, his imagination getting the better of him.  He was only 13 after all.  

The clone appeared beside him, but it was terrible.  It basically looked like a deformed version of a dead Hiroshi.  The thing was atrocious.  He sat there looking at his fail, stone faced. ". . . So I need to work on that. . . "* - Fri Dec  4 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: That was. . .Wow. .  - Fri Dec  4 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was a bit embarassed by the display he had put on.  He had never seen something look so bad a day in his life, especially not anything he ever did.  He slapped both of his cheeks twice, trying to hype himself up.  "Come on. . Come on. . You got this."  He put up the seal and held it.  Trying to concentrate on making a water filled clone.  "Like a jar. . Like a jar. . . "

He released the jutsu once more and a better version then last time appeard, but it still wasn't pretty.  He looked at it, it looked at him.  Hiro punched it and it dispelled, a single drop of water fell to the sand and evaporated.  "That thing was just as ugly as the first one."  He shook his head and went back to atempting to learn this jutsu.

For a single sealed jutsu, this was proving to be a hard one to get under his belt.  Why was this thing so hard to mak?  Was it because he was in Suna?  Was it because he wasn't the best ninjutsu user?  What could it be?  All these thoughts ran through his head as he stood there, focusing again.  The Suitonic chakra inside of him starting to stir.  "This is hard."  He says while gathering his chakra.

He had gathered what he felt to be enough chakra and nodded his head.  To whom?  He didn't know, he just nodded his head.  He released the jutsu and a clone appeared beside him.  It as least looked like him this time, but was it full of water?  Hiro would punch this clone as well.  it was not full of water, but there was some more in it then last time.  He smiled.  He knew that he would get it the next time around.

With his hands already locked into the seal.  He started to concentrate even more chakra into this technique.  She had said something about useing more chakra with the last jutsu, so he figured it might work with this one too.  Keeping himself focused only on the end result being a perfect clone made of water.  He blanked out everything else that didn't have anything to do with the jutsu.  He was in what some called. "The Zone"  He unleased the jutsu and immediately, he knew he had done something different.  The clone stood right beside him.  Hiro would not punch this one.  He just looked at it with a smile.  "Haha"* - Fri Dec  4 20:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would smile and nod his head.  He never misse an opportunity to get into a spar.  He didn't want to just walk in and try to hit somebody though, that wasn't his style.  Instead, he casually strolled over towards the spar, stretching a bit as he did so.

"Alright Nami, let me loosen up a bit.  Then, it is on."  He would say with a smile.* - Sat Dec  5 00:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would also srop his weights.  Things were about to heat up a bit.  This was going to be a great warm up before the exams.  As his weights hit the ground, Nami was right there on top of him.  Throwing some strikes at him in a flurry.  He moved his body accordingly, dipping and dodging out of the way of the attacks as they came one after the other.  Suddenly, she started to spin.  Seeing this before, he thought it woudl be fun to do the same thing that she was doing.  So he started to spin also.  Throwing the same exact kick that she had thrown.  Their kicks would clash and he would jump back with a smile.

"Things are just starting Nami, come on.  What else you got in your little bag of tricks?"* - Sat Dec  5 00:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was doidng a bit too much talking, and was about to pay the price.  As he jumped back, she was right there with him.  Throwing yet another attack.  Before he knew it, his feet were gone from under him, he knew what was coming next, all too well.  "Shit. . I did it again."  He would think to himself.

His feet not off of the ground, he did not have the abiltiy to move around in the air how he pleased.  Defenseless, he was kicked again and again.  Being pushed up in the air further and further.  Before he knew it, one final attack came at him and cause him to spin around in the air.  He was attempting to stop himself, but to no avail.  He felt like he was on the mary-go-round.* - Sat Dec  5 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not able to move at this point.  The attacks came in bunches and he was goign down to the ground further and further towards the ground.  Until, he landed on his back in a decent amount of pain.  He opened his eyes, he knew what was coming next.  This wasn't new to him at all.  A mighty kick hit him in his stomach, causing him some considerable pain.  He layed there for a second holding on to his stomach.  Slowly, he rose to his feet, still holding on to his stomach. 

"Damn Nami.  Did you find a way to get even stronger?  You will do great in the tournament."  He says with a smile.* - Sat Dec  5 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) leaned back a bit at first, caught off guard by the speed that she was approaching.  This was all just a joke and she threw her arm around his neck.  He smiled at her and started to speak.

"Yup yup.  But there are still some things I haven't shown you."  He then put a hand on his chin.  He would then start to whisper only to her.* - Sat Dec  5 00:56:44 2015

She said that she had worked so hard for the fight she was going to have against him. Then he couldn't even show up.  He didn't even try to move for now.  He just took the punch full on, taking all the damage.  He deserved this much.  Blood shot out of his mouth as the fist connected with his stomach.  He then started to talk slowly, struggling to even do so through the pain.

"*cough* L-look Momu. . . My mom. . . S-She. . . "  He couldn't finish his statement.  He sat there crying.  If she was goign to take advantage of this, so be it.  He was totally crushed.* - Sat Dec  5 05:55:24 2015

"She. . . Momu. . S-S. . "  He lost the battle.  The tears started to roll down his face uncontrolably.  He wouldn't move, he would just sit there, his head resting against her shoulder as he started to explain.

"I. . I got a letter. . . My dad said mom had been in a terrible accident. . .And that she was probably not going to make it. I went there as fast as I could, trying to see her again before she passed over.  You know I am not from here.  I lived in a small town, just outside of here.

So many bad things had happened in such a short amount of time.* - Sat Dec  5 06:06:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) wiped his eyes and gave her a smile.  He was thankful for everything she had just did.  He walked over and attempted to hug her.

"Thanks Auntie. . . You are the second best!"* - Sat Dec  5 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Second Best huh... - Sat Dec  5 07:03:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked into class today, his eyes glazed over.  He really didn't feel like going to class today, but he had to start coming more.  He had missed too many classes already.  He found his desk, placed his supplies down beside him, and leaned back non-chalauntly in the chair.  He began twirling his pncil between his fingers, waiting on the lesson to start.  He was actually the first one there, he figured if he started coming early, they would realize that he was serious about trying to catch back up.

HIs instructor wlked in and gave him a smile and a wave.  Hir, forced a smile onto his face and waved, half-heartedly.  The instructor did not know him well enough to realize that this was all an act, so he used it to his advantage.  "How are you today young man?" 

"I am fine teach.  I am just ready to get the lesson and learn something new today!"  He would with the same fake ass smile.  She couldn't tel the difference.  She smiled back and put a stack of papers onto her own desk, separating them.  About 5 minutes after she started the rest of the students started to trickle into the classroom.  The lesson was about to start.

The instructor had a name, but Hiro barely called her.  There were a few new faces in the room besides Hiro, that she noticed.  So she started the lesson off by re-introducing herself.  She cleared her throat, and began to speak.  "Hello class.  My name is Aiko-Sensei, and I am your instructer for the rest of this term.  I hope all of you have come prepared to learn more and become better shinobi!  Now, today the next few lessons are all about Kekkei Genkai.  Does anyone know what a Kekkei Genkai is?"

Several students rasied their hands.  Hiro just sat there looking around to see who knew the answer.  He knew, but he was too lazy to raise his hand and answer the question.  She called on a the girl that was sitting directly beside Hiroshi.  He didn't notice it before, but she was kind of cute.  Too bad he was taken, he shrugged his shoulders and awaited her answer.  He wanted to see how smart she was now.

The young girl stood up beside her desk and started to speak.  Having a slight accent, signifying tha she might not be from here.  "Kekkei Genkai are specific abilities passed down genetically through specific clans."  She would stand there awaiting the teachers apprval of her answer.  Hiro just nodded his head, knowing that she was correct.  "Heheh, she got it right."  He would think to himself.

Aiko-Sensei would give her a warm smile and then start to speak once again.  "You are correct Akiko, thank you.  You may be seated now."  Akiko sat down, and Aiko turned towards the white board behind her.  She started to draw a chart.  The chart was very simple.  It was just a pentagrphic arrangement of the five chakra natures.  Water, Earth, Fire, Wind, and Lightning.  From there, she started to pair them up in various different ways.  Water and Fire, Water and Earth, Water and Wind, and finally Water and Lightning.  Hiroshi stared at the board, this ws something that he didn't really know too much about.  So he actually woke up a tad.

Aiko-Sensei started to give the lecture.  "Ok, today, we are going to start off with the Kekkei Genkai that have the Water chakra element within them.  As you can see, water can be mixed with anyother chakra nature to create a Kekkei Genkai.  The first mix, Water and Fire, produces what we call the Boil, or Steam release.  As the two names suggest, thes involve using either a scolding hot steam like vapor, or boiling your insides with some nice hot water."  Aido-Sensei would then get a look of intense pleasure across her face as she continued to talk about all of the deadly things that this Kekkei Genkai could do.  Hiro was a bit taken by this.  "Wow. . . She likes hurting people. . A lot."  he mumbles to himself.

Akiko heard what he said and giggled, looking over at him.  He didn't know she had heard him and laughed with her.  It was kind of funn.  Just then, a marker came whizzing past his face.  He looked over to the board to see Aiko-Sensei glaring at him with a demonic smile.  She casually turned her head slightly to the side and closed her eyes.  "Is something funny Hiroshi-kun?"  Hiro immedieatly stopped laughing and straightened up.  "N-No Aiko-Sensei."  She would then turn back to the board and the pressure that filled the room would leave.  "Good! Now back to the lesson!"  Hiro sat there with his pencil in hand.  "Wow . . .That was intense."

The lesson concluded and Hiroshi gathered his stuff and walked out.  The lesson on Kekkei Genkai with teh water element in them all within his knowledge now.* - Sat Dec  5 17:30:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Yup yup - Sat Dec  5 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) stood there for a second, thinging about what he wanted to do with his training time with his bro.  He decided to go with a jutsu Trill had been nice enough to help him learn.  He put up a single seal, just for the formality of it.  He wasn't too good with the jutsu just yet, so he did it for support.  When he did this, the earth surrounding Hiro would seemingly turn into a fluid and he would dip inside it, disappearing from Green's view.  Hiro started to swim around down there to get a better feel for it.

Still underground, he started to think about all of the things going on in his life right about now.  Seemed like things were starting to pick up.  The chuunins were over and the festival that Kyu had tol him about was about to start up anytime now.  He couldn't wait.  He was going to have as much fun as possible. Not too often he gets to relax.

Hiro started to play around a bit as he trained.  It was to keep himself going a bit.  He put a single figer above his head and stuck it out of the ground.  He was pretending to be a shark.  He thrashed around, under the earth.  Imagioning himself in a fight with another vicious being of the sea.  The entire time, he was smiling.

He was starting to get accustumed to moving around down there.  It was actually a lot like another jutsu that he had.  But this wan seemed like it helped him move a bit.  He continued to swim laps around Green, this was the only thing that he was focusing on for now, so he started to pick up speed.

"Hahahhaa.  I like this jutsu.  I feel like I am in a iant swimming pool.  The only thing I need now is a diving board and. . . . . Heheheheh yup. I need to get a pool"  He would think to himself.  Anybody that knew anything about Hiro knew exactly what he had just inagioned.  He was just that kind of dude.  He continued to train, with a new found inspiration.

This was starting to get a bit hard on him.  Continuous use of this jutsu was starting to take a toll on his chakra.  Still, he was not going to stop.  He was going to do something before that.  He swam over to his brother and popped out directly behind him.  He grabbed him on both of his shoulders and screamed at him, trying to scare him for the fun of it.  "BOOOOOOO!"* - Sat Dec  5 18:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) told Momu that he was going to go all out.  So that is what he did.  He dropped his weights and prepared hismelf for battle.  She was moving a quite the speed, but, with his vision he had no problem watching her every move.  He watched her zig-zag and everything else before she came to him.  He smiled.

"This is going to be fun."  

As the she tried to throw a feint at him, he just kept staring in a defensive position.  He could see everything so clearly.  He was in a zone he had never been in before.  A kick came his way and he would use his own speed to push her kick away with his left hand.  Then when she attempted to kick him again, he would use his right hand and parry that kick away.  Fluidly, he would attempt to throw a sweeping left kick at her feet, he was trying to knock her off balance a bit after catching her off guard with his parries.  If he could indeed do that, he would throw a might elbow down into her gut to try and send her crashing into the ground.* - Sat Dec  5 19:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would smile at Momu's ability to dodge his attack.  It made things a bit more interesting.  He recalled a time when she couldn't do any of that.  She had been working hard.  A punch was now coming his way, with Momu in the air.  This was probably the best chance he was going to have this entire spar to do anything.  The fist was coming fast, very fast.  Momu's attacks had gotten faster, but so did Hiro's reflexes.  He leaned back, attempting to dodge the punch completely.  He ws not fast enought o move completely out of the way, but he did neutralize most of the damage from taking a full blown punch to the side of his face.  The punch caught his cheek and turned his head to the side.  He planted and caught himself with his left foot. 

"My turn Momu."

While she was still in the air, he used the same left foot to attempt to thrw a might push kick into her stomach before she came down to the ground.  He was trying to send her flying up into the air, pretty high.  Leaving her defenseless, unless of course she could move around at will in the air.* - Sat Dec  5 19:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was going to try and land a decisive blow in this spar.  He wasn't too sure that he was going to be able to end it with this, but this might have been his best shot to do it.  He put his hands at his sides, clenched in fists tightly.  He then brought both of them up in front of his face, in the shape of an X.  He then started to speak quickly.

"Gate of Opening. .. . OPEN!"  

He brought his arms back down to his side.  The sand starting to rise around him from the amount of chakra he had just released.  He started to move, extremely fast.  Still not as fast as Momu, but it was fast.  She might not even be able to track his movements.  He ran to the wall on the left and ran up it.  He then shot off at her full strength, flipping into a mighty jump kick.  He tried to send her flying over both Green and Mizura into the other wall.  He put a lot into this trying to find a way to end this spar quickly.  He could not hold this form for long.* - Sat Dec  5 19:30:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would be met with a mighty punch.  This collision would send a sharp pain throught his leg as they hit.  He would go flying back the way he came, his left leg badly hurt.  It was not anything like a broken leg, he just knew that if he pushed it too much more, he might snap it.  He hit the wall with a solid thud and would start to fall down towards the ground.  He could not hold on to the first gate anymore right now, it wsa too draining.  He released it as he was falling, holding his leg.  

"Nice hit Momu" He would think to himself.  As he ws falling, he would coat himself in his doton chakra.  Instead of hitting the ground, he would simply fall through it.  He was hopint the Momu would not be able to see him, since she wsa also flying away.  He remained underground for now, trying to catch her by surprise.* - Sat Dec  5 19:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not ready for her to be under the ground with him.  He saw her coming, but it wasn't much he could do about it.  She really did catch him off guard.  The punch would connect with his stomach, causing him to spit out some more blood.  But, instead of letting her pull back, he latched onto her hand.  Smiling, with blood running down his face.  He couldn't move just yet, the pain was too great.  He just held on for now, attempting to recover a bit.

Seemed like he had found a way to let this one slip between his fingers.  He was ok with that.  He had fun, he needed a workout like this to help him find some of his faults.  He knew what he had to do in his trining.  He knew wha t he was going to have to work on and how he ws going to handle it.  He was very apprieciative of Momu for this lesson.  He might have lost the spar.  But it had more positives in his mind the negatives.  He sat there, head in the ground for a second, until he was able fall on his somach and his head back on the surface.  He couldn't move right now, he was hurting.  He smiled, beaten and battered.
