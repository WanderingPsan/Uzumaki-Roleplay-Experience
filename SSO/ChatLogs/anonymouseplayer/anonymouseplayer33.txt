"Then I am going to come to you."* - Tue Dec  8 04:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would turn his attention back to Nami.  He had no sensing, so he had no idea that Geo was still here.  He looked into her eyes, playing in her hair some more.

"Now that we are alone.  I can finally do something I have wnted to do for a while now."  He would then proceed to slide from under her and position himself on top of her, on all fours.  He would lean in and attempt to kiss her gentely on her neck, as his left hand slowly made its way up her body, to her breast.  Unless, of course, he was stopped.* - Tue Dec  8 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . .  - Tue Dec  8 04:18:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Like I said, not their business. - Tue Dec  8 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I'm going to whip his ass. - Tue Dec  8 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Which is why I don't show affection in public. - Tue Dec  8 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Well, we are alone for real now.~ - Tue Dec  8 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Fine. Don't go overboard like TRYING TO MOUNT ME. - Tue Dec  8 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *laughs*  So you want me to move? - Tue Dec  8 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Be honest. - Tue Dec  8 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Yes. - Tue Dec  8 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) laughed as he moved from over top of her.  He wasn't just going to stop now though.  He was already in too deep.  He scooped her up and place her in his lap, facing forward.  He would then attempt to lean in and proceed to attempt to place his lips on her neck.  Sucking slightly while gentely licking her neck.  He wanted to try and make her moan.  He wraped both of his arms around her, placing a hand on each cheek of her bottom.  This of course, only happend if she did not stop him.* - Tue Dec  8 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) couldn't make it happen so fast.  He had to work a bit harder.  He tightened the grip on her butt as he proceeded to slowly move up to her ear lobe.  He didn't just go straight there, he gently let his toung slide up her neck and cheek, until he had gotten to the ear lobe.  One there, he gentely bit on it a tad, nibbling on it for the time being.  He wanted to see how she reacted to all of this.  He spoke to her in between the nibbles.

"I have wanted to do this for forever."  He would say in a seductive voice as he went back to work on her ear.* - Tue Dec  8 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) felt her grip tighten.  He continued to work on the ear for a second until he heard her start to speak.  He pulled back and looked her in her eyes. 

"Let me give that mouth of yours something to do."

He would lean in and place his tongue inside of her mouth.  He placed his tongue on the roof of her mouth and essentially rolled an "R" in her mouth.  While all of this was happening, he moved his left hand from her butt, up her body until he had a handful of her breast.  He still wasn't sure if he found that spot yet, but he was damn sure going to try and find it.* - Tue Dec  8 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looked at her for a second with a sly smile.

"Why do you want to stop baby?  I thought you were enjoying it as much as I was?  Weren't you?"  

He never removed his hands from her breast or her butt.  He immediately leaned back in trying to kiss her again, unless she stopped him.* - Tue Dec  8 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not going to push forward again.  He leaned back, his hands being placed flat on the ground, her still on his lap and looked up into the sky.  He smiled and started to speak.

"I don't want to force myself on you, but why are we stopping.  You can't tell me that you weren't enjoying it.  I saw your face."  He looked at her and gave her a sly smile.* - Tue Dec  8 04:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) shrugged his shoulders and smiled at her.

"Just shut up and kiss me one more time before we leave."  He would then lean in and attempt to give her one last kiss that she would remember for a while to come.* - Tue Dec  8 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled and stood up.  He dusted himself off and then proceeded to slap her on the ass, hard.  He knew she could take it.

"Fine, I will get it another day.  Come on, let's go back."  He would extend a hand towards her for her to hold as they made their way back into the village.* - Tue Dec  8 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would wrap his arms around her as she pressed her ass against his. . Watch your mouth. . . She could very well feel what was going on down there.  He smiled and started to speak.

"I thought you wanted to stop?  You are about to get the entire thing started again baby."* - Tue Dec  8 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Do you want me to move away then? - Tue Dec  8 04:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Just stay right here. - Tue Dec  8 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was kissed on the cheek.  He had warned her about how he was not going to be able to hold himslef bach for much longer.  That kiss set him off again.  He tapped her on her shoulder, hoping that she would turn around.  If she did, he would then proceed to kiss her again.  He worked his tongue around inside her mouth until her tongue was in his mouth.  He would then slowly and lightly start to suck on her tongue.  While all this was happening, he took his right hand and using only his index finger and his thumb, grabbed her nipple.  His left hand sqeezing down on her butt again.  All this could be avoided if she didn't turn around however.* - Tue Dec  8 05:08:54 2015

He was indeed starting to lose all sense of reason that he ha had.  Which at this point, wasn't much to begin with.  He placed his hands on her hips attempting to stop her for a second so he could speak.

"Nami. . Girl, if you keep this up.  I promise you, I will try and go all the way, right here.  There will be no stopping me.  Now I am going to move my hands, I will let you make the decision on if you want to go there or not.  You said you didn't verbally, but your actions are speaking waaaaayyy louder then your words."  He would proceed to smile and lift his hands into the air, waiting to see if she would stop or not.* - Tue Dec  8 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was kissed and gave her a smile.

"You did.  You made him really happy.  So happy to the point that he felt like he might have had to take action.  Just know, next time, There won't be so many chances."  He would say with a seductive smile.* - Tue Dec  8 05:20:51 2015
