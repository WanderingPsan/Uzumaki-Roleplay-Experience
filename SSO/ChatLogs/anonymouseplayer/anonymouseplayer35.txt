<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled at his Sensei and got into his fighting stance.

"No worries Sensei, you had other things that you had to do."

He would then loosen himself up a bit by bouncing from foot to foot.  He would then start to perform the new series of kicks that his Paine-Sense had aught him.  He would start off with a sweeping low kick.  With a mighty spin he would raise himself up slightly and deliver a high kick.  He would leap into the air and start to flip furiously.  Finally, he sent a mighty heel drop crashing down onto the training area.  He rose to his feet and smiled at Paine again.

"How was that Sensei?"* - Wed Dec  9 06:01:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) wasn't one-hundred percent sure what exactly he had did wrong, or what was up with the rocks.  But, his Sensei had said that something needed to be fixed, so something needed to be fixed, end of discussion.  He stood there, still staring at the rocks, tryin to find the answers to all of the questions that she had just sprung on him.  Had something happened recentely to distract him?  Could he break the rock?  Why wasn't the whirlwind visable?  He started to question himself as he stared into the rock.

"I. . Umm. . .Hmm.  I am pretty sure I can break the rock if I wanted too.  I mean, it is just a rock, I have broken many of them already.  This would just be another one added to the list.  About the whirlwind, I don't know.  I don't know why it wasn't visible.  Maybe I didn't put enough effort into it?  Maybe I need to work on spinning faster again?  I am really not sure about this one Sensei.  Now, to address the last question.  Anything that has happened to me recently, was only because I wanted it to happen.  Nothing that I can remember really distracts me too much.  I mean, I am in a relationship now and it is actually going quite well.  I didn't see that as a distraction though.  I tend not to do things that I don't want to do."  He had answered all of her questions to the best of his ability, now he just had to go back to being a good little pupil.* - Wed Dec  9 06:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) took heed to what she was saying and stared at the rocks, again.  He took a deep breath and relaxed.  He cleared his mind of all thoughts, the only thing that mattered now was doing what she told him too.  This task was a lot harder then what he thought it would be.  He figured he could just shut his brain down at will, that seemed to be a lie.  He couldn't seem to stop thinking about any and everything.

"Clear my mind. . Clear my mind. . . Damn this is hard.  I can't get her out of my head.  All I can think about is the future with her.  My kids, my work, my wife, that is all I can think about.  Am I really this single minded?  How did I not know this before?  Is she my inspiration?  I knew she was important, but damn.  I think. . O wow.  What the hell is that in the rocks?  Is that?. . "  He would think to himself.  

Hiroshi squinted hie eyes a bit, trying to make sure he was really seeing what he was seeing.  They were rocks right?  Why could he see Kinami's face so clearly in the rocks.  He rubbed his eyes and shook his head, trying to refocus himself.  There she was again, clear as day, in the rocks.  He was at a loss for words, he couldn't figure out what was going on.

"Sensei. . All I can see in the rocks. . .Is her.  All I can see is her Sensei.  What does that even mean?  She isn't here.  Why can I see her so clearly?  This makes no sense.  I am so confused.  What did you ask me again?  I'm sorry, I must be going crazy.  I can't think straight.  What the hell is wrong with me?"

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Alright. - Wed Dec  9 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was happy beyond compare.  He felt like he had not gotten to spar anybody in a good little while.  Who better to spar then Kinami?  Nobody in his eyes.  He stretched out a bit, making sure everything was nice and lmber.  He wasn't trying to break anything in a simple spar.  He moved a piece of his hair out of his face and smiled.

"Here I come."

He darted off at Kinami, full speed, well as fast as he could go with this big ass shell on his back.  He closed the distance quickly, to the point that Kinami might be surprised by the amount of speed he possesed now.  She hadn't faught him in a while, so he was hoping to use the element of surprise.  Once within range, he would launch a simple right hook aimed at her left rib cage.  If he was able to do that, he would follow up with a right knee straight to her gut.* - Wed Dec  9 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) wasn't quite fast enough yet, but that is what training was for.  He was not going to drop the shell just yet.  He was just going to push through this and find a way to manage without taking it off.  Kinami skillfully handled his attacks and returned some attacks of her own.  He smiled as a single thought came through his head.

"I should have known."

The kick was coming directly for his forhead.  He brought his hands up and sheilded himself from the blow, taking minimal damage to his hands, nothing too serious.  He felt her push off, attempting to create some distance between them.  The moment she pushed off, he started to sprint towards her, while she was still in the air.  When her feet touched the ground, he would be right there again, this time performing a swift series of kicks.  

He stared off with a sweeping low kick to try and set her up.  He followed up wih an extremely quick spin and a kick to her gut, if she was hit by the low kick of course.  He continued to pick up speed as he spun and thw sand on the ground around him started to swirl.  He would jump up and throw a high kick towards her chest.  Lastly, he flipped furiously in the air and then delivered a massive heel drop to her shoulder.   None of these attacks were meant to cause her too much harm.  He just wanted her to feel it a bit, this was only a spar.  Plus, he wouldn'tbe able to live with himself if he hurt her.* - Wed Dec  9 08:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) dropped his shell before the spar had started.  He didn't realize that Geo was about to go this hard, but he was cool with it.  This was going to be pretty fun.  Geo cam to him extremely quickly, as soon as his shell hit the ground, Geo was there.  A kick was coming towards Hiro's chin, a kick that he saw coming the entire time.   He balled up his fist and punchd Geo in the shin, while leaning back only slightly.  The punch was to change the course of the kick.  Hiro smiled as he performed this counter and went on to his own offensive.

Geo was low to the ground already, so Hiro figured that this would be a good plan of action for him.  He wouldn't open the gate, he ain't have the stamina for all that.  He would just put everything he had into the attack.  Geo was like his name said, a rock.  He woud be fine.  He attempted to sweep him with a swift low kick.  He woudl follow up with a mighty spin and another kick to Geo's stomach, driving him further into the air.  He would continu his mighty rotation and thoew a single high kick to send him even higher.  Hiro leaped into the air and started to flip around furoiusly.  Then delivered a massive heel drop to the back of Geo's head.  All of this only happend if Geo was hit by the initial low attack.* - Wed Dec  9 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had his kicks stopped by Geo's seemingly unbreakable defenses.  He cursed at himself under his breath as a mighty fist was coming towards his chin.  He put up a single seal and would seemingly poof away, appearing a decent distance away from Geo.  He would wipe the little bit of sweat from his forhead as he stood in his fighting stance.  He smiled at Geo and began to speak.

"Hahaha.  That was close Geo.  That one might have acutally hurt if it had hit me.  Now come on.  The fun is only beginning."* - Wed Dec  9 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Gonna go see who's about.. - Wed Dec  9 09:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Haha, good job honey. - Wed Dec  9 09:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was still a bit dazed from the shunshin he had just used.  He was not able to put the distance between him tht he wanted.  A fist started to come towards his chin, fast.  He knew that right after a shunshin he was not able to move his body the way he wanted, so he put his hands up under his chin, to try and reduce the damage as much as he could.  He to, like Geo, was pretty durable.  So when his punch made contact with his hands, it powered through, driving Hiro's hands into his own chin.  His head cocked back and felt himself going backwards and planted his left foot.  He was still trying to collect himself, he might be good after this, but he wasn't good now.  He looked ate Geo, his chin slightly red.

"You got me good."* - Wed Dec  9 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: I am going to beat this bastard somehow. . . - Wed Dec  9 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled upon hearing Geo's comment.  He might have been right, but Hiro wasn't going to change that now.  It was something that he had had goign for him for 15 years.  He was starting to get himself back together now and cold move pretty much at will now.  His chin still hurt a bit, but that wasn't going to slow him down.  He immediately recognized what Geo was doing as he got into his stance.  He remembered all too well what power lied behind that punch.  Hiro had little time to react, Geo was already so close.  All he could do was try it and hope for the best.  The moment he saw Geo get into that stance, he attempted to literally slide to his left.  He recalled that the punch did indeed take some time to come off.  It was a mighty punch after all.  

While he was sliding, Hiro ran through three seals quickly.  Dog! Rabbit! Snake!  then for the hell of it.  A clap.  A gust of wind would start to blow from behind Hiro directly at Geo, hopefully knocking him off of his feet.  If that was possible.* - Wed Dec  9 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was able to get off his jutsu, but that shit just tickled this man.  The pressure from the punch sending him rolling towards Kinami.  He knew exactly where he was going and put both hands on the ground, along with his feet, trying to stop himself from making contact with her.  He was not going to allow her to get involved.  This was his fight.  The sand was burning his hands terribly as he finally came to a screeching halt inches in front of Kinami.  He would turn and look shake his hands off with a smile.

"Whew, that was close.  Sorry baby."

He would then dart off at Geo full speed.  This nin thing wasn't goign to work out, at least not all that much.  He had to be smarter about the entire thing.  Once he got back within range of Geo, he would attempt to hit him with essentially the same kick that Geo started with.  He tried to smash his chin in with a might kick to send him flying into the air.* - Wed Dec  9 09:55:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) didn't make it back to Geo and fell face first into the sand.  He looked back with a confused expression.

"So you want me to stay here?  Alright."  He sat up and leaned back against the wall besider her.

"Sorry Geo. . I guess you won that one."* - Wed Dec  9 09:57:45 2015
