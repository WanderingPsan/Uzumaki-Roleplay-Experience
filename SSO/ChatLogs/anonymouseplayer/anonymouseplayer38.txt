<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Ok. - Fri Dec 11 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Well then, you start them off. - Fri Dec 11 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: They are about to arrive. - Fri Dec 11 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: W-wha~ - Fri Dec 11 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) pat his bro on the head with a smile.  "Relax Green, you are too uptight.  You didn't even tell them our names."  Hiro would then let out a quick laugh, and turn to the three students.  He had always had a soft spot for kids, but that little girl was just too adorable.  He smiled at all three and started to speak to them in a calm, clear voice.

"Ok, Like he said.  We are going to be teaching you all about chakra natures.  I am Hiroshi, and he is. . .Hiroshi.  I know that might be a little confusing for you all.  So use this to help you out when thinking of us."  He points to his hair.  "Just call me blue.  I have blue hair, so it should be easy to remember."  He then pointed at Green.  "Just. . . O boy."  He had been slacking on his brotherly duties, and didn't really notice that Green, didn't wear his green hoodie anymore.  He had probably grown out of it by now.  "Ummm.  Just call him Hiroshi."  He would say with a smile.

"Ok, back to the lesson.  As he stated, there are 5 different chakra natures.  Wind, Water, Earth, Lightning, and Fire.  Each one is either strong, or weak to another nature.  Can any of you tell me how that works?"  The little girl in the dress would rais her hand.  She looked like she was nervous, so Hiro tried to help calm her down.  He walked over to her and gentely pat her on the head.  "Ok sweetie.  What do you know?" 

The little girl smiled and started to talk.  "Water puts out the hot hot.  That's what my mommy says."  She would then give him a giant, front toothless smile.  Hiro would stand up and return her smile.  "Good job.  Water is strong against Fire.  But there are a few more that you should know.  I will tell you about them now.  Get ready, it is going to be coming at you all pretty fast.  But I think you can hang."

"Water is strong against Fire.  This is very logical, because you all see people put out fire with water all of the time.  On the other sied of that, Water is weak to Earth.  To help paint a picture, The earth sucks up water and helps make plants.  Tha t is essentially the way that the chakra nature works.  Now, Earth, as I just said is strong against Water.  But, it is weak against Lightning.  Licghning strikes the earth and everything goes down hill.  Lightining is strong to earth and weak to wind.  The wind can cut clean through the lightning.  Lastly, Wind is strong agains Lightning, but weak against Fire.  The Wind just makes the hot hot even hotter.  Now, Hiroshi here will finish up your lesson.  Do you all understand?"  

The kids would smile and say yes in unison.  They then directed their attention to Green for the final part of the lesson.* - Fri Dec 11 06:26:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would smile and nod his head.

"Yup, class dismissed."* - Fri Dec 11 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Ok, next we have to deliver wood to a small place outside of the land of fire. - Fri Dec 11 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Awh~ - Fri Dec 11 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *bops him on the head* No complaining.  This isi important work too. - Fri Dec 11 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: *groans* Fine~ - Fri Dec 11 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled at his borhter as he led him into the forest.  the two of them had to cut down a tree and deliver some wood to a small place.  The shop keeper was nice enough to give them a double handled saw, and a couple of wheelbarrells to take the wood in after they had cut it.  This should be a pretty easy mission.  But, in the shinobi world, things didn't always go as planned.

The two of them got to the outskirts of the forest at Hiro started to talk to his brother.  "Ok.  We just have to go in, find a big tree, cut it down, and take the wood to the village.  Shouldn't be too hard.  But, we are shinobi.  We have to be ready for anything.  If something comes that you think you might not be able to handle.  Either step back, or run back here.  If I tell you to leave and come here without me. . . "  He then gets a demonic glow around him.  he wanted to show his Brother how serious he was about this.  "Do it. . .No questions. . just go and get help. Got it?"

They would enter the forest and Hiro would start to look around for a nice sized tree.  He found one that was a lot taller then both of them combined.  He looked up at it and cupped his hand around his eyes to sheild them from the sun.  He pulled out the saw and then instructed Green to grab the other side.  Now, this is the going to be something that they would have to work together on.  But, he was sure that he and his bro could do it.

Push and pull the two bothers would go to work.  The saw would cut into the wood bit by bit.  The chips of wood would fly in all directions.  They were almost done with the first half.  They were going at a good pace.  "How are you holding up Green?"* - Fri Dec 11 06:52:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Show me what you can do. - Fri Dec 11 12:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Right! - Fri Dec 11 12:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: true xD - Fri Dec 11 12:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) stood there with a smile on his face.  It was not too often that his little Bro asked him to train.  He was used to having to bop him on the head and pretty much drag him to the training area.  This was a nice change of pace.  He had the opportunity to teach his brother a few mor things.  Things that he can only learn during the course of battle.  Well, enough talk, it was time for him to do something.

As Green slipped below the surface, Hiro was watching him carefully.  He knew the seal that he had put up, I mean, he taught the kid the damn thing.  Still, he was even more focused on how his brother was planning to attack him then usual.  He was trying to gain a better understanding of different fighting styles anyway.  Looks like Green's was the first one he was going to break down.  

For right now, Green was trying to use a surprise approach.  A very basic, yet useful style to go about in a battle.  Hiroshi knew the jutsu he had used, and knew the ups and downs of it.  This was all part of his increased study in how people battle.  A smile came across his face, as his mind started to run through various ideas on how to combat his lil bro.  "Hahaha.  Good job Green."

"Ok, so he is under the ground right now.  Do I really want to go down there and just knock him back up here?  Hmmm.  Nah, I think I am going to  try something else.  Something a little.. . . hahaha I might ge a chuckle out of this.  I know he can sense what is going on on the surface, but on that rock over there?  Nah, he aint got that one.  Let's do this."  He would jump on the wall beside him, using his suimen to his advantage.  

He stood on the wall, parallel to the ground, keeping a sharp eye out for whenever his brother decided to come out and look for him.  He put up a single seal and took a deep breath.  His cheeks puffed out as he held the seal, and the jutsu.  Waiting for his time to strike.* - Fri Dec 11 12:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled as Green resurfaced as Hiro planned.  But, he didn't just resurface, he attacked.  A ball of lighning was coming his way, and movinig at a pretty decent pace.  Hiro wanted to smile again, but he didn't want to let his plan fail before it started.  He darted down towards the ground, full speed, to avoid the oncoming ball of lightning.  He would hear it crack ans sizzle as it went just over his head, onto the wall.  "Hmm, that one might have hurt."  He thinks to himself.

As he was running, he unleashed the jutsu he had stored in his back pocket at his brother.  A powerful stream of water would come flying out of Hiroshi's mouth.  Nothing too damaging, he basically just wanted to knock him over, if he could.  Plus, he thought it would be kinda funny to soak his brother in water.  He was a dick, so what?* - Fri Dec 11 12:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: ... - Fri Dec 11 12:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) 's stream of water was met with yet another ball of lightining.  His eyes widened a bit, as the ball was coming towards the water.  "Ohhhhhh shit. . . ."  He would think to himself.  He quickly attempted to cut off the stram of water.  Just as he had finally gotten it to stop, the lightning had made it's way up the stream and gave Hiro a nice little jolt.  His heart skipped a beat and he stood there for a second, trying to collect himself.  "Hehehe nice move Bro."  He thinks once again.

Just when he thought that he was gogn to be able to stand there for a second, to try and get himslef back together.  A kunai came flying over his head and onto the wall above him.  He looked up, and noticed a tag.  Then, boom!  The tag exploded and rocks started to tumble down towards him.  He had not fully recovered from the shock just yet.  He couldn't move at full speed, but he could at least sheild himsef from the falling rocks.  In fact, he might even be able to use them to his advantage.  He had a good grip on this jutsu, so he only needed three seals.  Dog! Rabbit! Snake!  As the final snake seal was put together.  A mighty gust of wind would start to blow from behind Hiroshi, sending the rocks hurling towards his Bro.  He smiled as he watched to see how his opponent would handle the rocks.* - Fri Dec 11 13:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) kept a sharp eye on Green.  It seemed that he had picked up yet another skill while Hiro wasn't looking.  "I see, so he can uae a sword now too?"  He watched carefully as he slashed away at the rocks as fast as he could.  It was actually pretty impressive.  For someone his age to be able to handle a sword like that, he was proud to call him his brother.  Still, he analyzed the way he held the blade, the way he swung it.  Taking in all the information he could about his particular style of handling a sword.  He stored it in his memory back for the future.  "Hehehe, good job."  He thinks to himself.

A few of the rocks had made their way past the slashin sword and hit Green.  He fell to a knee at first, concerning Hiroshi a bit.  He wasn't about to harm his brother badly in a spar.  His concern was all for nothing though, as Green rose to his feet and started sparking.  Hiroshi knew that nothing good could come from it, and braced himself for the next attack.  He moved his foot to the left, just a small bit.  He heard a sploosh sound and looked down. . . Water.  "Oh hell no.  He is . . .Ok, nope. . Moving."  He jumped back onto the wall, useing it as a dry source for now.  The moment his feet left the ground, the water started to spark and crackle.  Green had done just what he thought he would do.  He called out from the rock.  "You really are trying to shock me today, huh?"  He would say with a smile and a laugh.

It seemed like his bro was doing a good job at keeping his distance.  Yet another style of fighting that He had to try and soak up.  This was indeed something that he had to learn to combat.  Everybody was not a close ranged fghter like he was, and he was goign to have to learn how to be able to counter act things like that.  No fight in the shinobi world ever goes exactly the way you want it too.  Another smile came across his face, as he jumped down from teh wall, onto the dry part of the sand and charged.  He was about to try and make his own move.

Green was sparking, but that didn't mean that there was nothing that Hiro could do.  He put up a single seal and then sent out three weak air bullets towards Green, to make him move, and hopefully stop him from sparking.  Wherever he moved, Hiroshi was ready to follow and attack.* - Fri Dec 11 13:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked over to his bro with a smile on his face and extended a hand to help him up.

"Good fight man.  You are coming along nicely I see.  That is good, I can't have my brother going around giving me a bad rep."  He would say with a smile.* - Fri Dec 11 13:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: At least not while you are here. . heheheheh - Fri Dec 11 21:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked into the academy and started to look around for the various books that Auntie had told him about.  as he was looking, his mind started to go over the various fighting styles of the many people he had faced in battle.  Some of the styles were different, some of them were similar, hell, some of them were the exact same.  Even he had his own unique way of fighting that he was going to break down while he was in here.

The first fighting style that he was going over was his own.  He sat there, leaning back in the chair with his feet propped up onto the desk in front of him.  Thoughts filled his head.  "Hmmm.  I am a taijutsu user, with a lot of ninjutsu to fall back on.  My ninjutsu isn't as strong as my taijutsu, but I have it there for when I need it.  I would say my strengths are my strength, reflexes, and my speed of which I can attack.  My weaknesses, my ninjutsu,  fighting long ranged fighter, and my lack of powerful taijutsu skills.  Hmmm, I sound terrible.  Oh well, it is me."

He shrugged his shoulders and went on to the next person in his memory bacnk.  Kinami.  "Ok, she can use multiple fighting styles.  The one that she usually uses when we spar, is her kung fu style.  While she is in that, she is noticably faster, and even a bit stronger.  It is amazing really.  I doubt she would ever show it too me, but it is something I would like to learn.  I'll talk to her about it later.  I just need to think of a way to combat it.  I need to gain an understanding of each fighting style that I can."

He yawned as he countinued to focus on Kinami's Kung fu style for now.  "Ok, so what are the ways that I can combat something like that?  I think I have a good understanding of something like that, I mean, I used to spar her all of the time.  Hmmm. .  I nkow her attacks get more precise and fluid as she goes into her stance.  I need to see it again before I can say I know the weaknesses.  Oh well.  ON to the next one."

He readjusted himself in the chair and accidentally knocked down a few of the papers off of Auntie's desk.  He popped up and grabbed the papers.  "Oh shit. . "  When he picked them up, he noticed something on the paper that he had never seen before.  Was it yet another style of combat for him to try and learn things about.  He sure hoped so.

He started at the paper and read it out loud.  "Pandora's light. . . What the hell is that?  Is it literally a light?  Maybe it is a food?  Hmmm, she told me not to mess with the papers, but, I have to know now.  This is important.  He searched the desk for a few papers to try and explain whatever this Pandora's light thingy was.  He found only one more sheet that he could really understand.

The paper said what elements made up this Pandora's light thingy.  He would nod his head as he once again started to read out loud.  "Elements huh?  So this Pandora's light thing must be a ninjutsu of some sorts.  But what the hell is it?  It is more then one?  Let me look at this paper.  Fire, Wind, and Earth. . . This is a combination of three different elements?  Wow, that is amazing.  I thought you could only mix two.  Hmmm, this might be a very productive style of combat."

He continued to look at the paper as he thought of Lera.  "So I wonder If Auntie can use this.  Wait, if she can use this, that means that she has at least four out of the five chakra elements.  Auntie really is amazing. "  He then notices Geo stolling in.  "So you decided to join me?"* - Fri Dec 11 21:15:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) went back to his little meditation for a little while.  It seemed as though Geo had decided to take  quick nap on him.  He went back to thinking about his Auntie as those papers were fresh in his mind.  "So, If Auntie can use this Pandora's light thingy.  That mean she has at least 4 chakra elements.  I wonder if she can use Lightning too.  I don't know, I can't jump to conclusions.  But i really want to ask her.  I hope she doesn't get too upset.  I really wasn't trying to lok.  i knocked the papers down and picked them up.  Then I saw some words that caught my attention.  Hmmmm.  I don't know."

He shook his head and refocused himself.  "Ok, enough thought on Auntie.  It is time to move on to the next persn that I am going to analyze in my head.  Momura.  She has these weired Ant like things going for her.  I don't know what they are, but she gets a lot stronger when she uses it.  I kind of like it to be honest.  It is interesting.  I need to get a definitive fighting style of my own.  Oh well, Focus on Momu for now."
