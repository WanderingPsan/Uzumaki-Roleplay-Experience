<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Bend your knees in mid-air. - Sat Nov 21 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: And then kick out when you arrive at your destination, before you move any forward. - Sat Nov 21 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Make an imaginary foe. - Sat Nov 21 06:31:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Ground Zero. - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Get it? - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I kicked you into the water because there was no ground. - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: If there was ground there. - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I think your head would've been fractured quite a bit. - Sat Nov 21 06:34:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Seido, Way(DungeonKing) glanced back and forth, his soft spoken eyes glancing towards the group of people and the man who assured everyone he bites. His eyes became slightly narrowed as he registered their positions and speech. With no words for which to speak, he stood there in silence for a few moments before taking a few steps forward.* - Sat Nov 21 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Seido, Way(DungeonKing) continued to calmly observe the four, trying to be wary if anything were to happen. He had never heard the name before until now, quickly wedging it into the back of his mind. As he stood in place, both arms seemed to dangle at each side, his back slightly hunched as if the weight of his arms were too much. There was a holster strapped to his left arm as well as to his right leg, the only things visible on his rather black cladded body. His voice unheard, as he awaited for this rather odd story to progress.* - Sat Nov 21 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, what brings you here to this dump of a village? - Sat Nov 21 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: What brings me here to Kirigakure? - Sat Nov 21 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Nothing in particular, really. - Sat Nov 21 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I simply wanted to.... - Sat Nov 21 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Test the waters. - Sat Nov 21 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I haven't been out in a while. - Sat Nov 21 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I've only been testing my jutsu. - Sat Nov 21 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'd like to get some fresh test subjects. - Sat Nov 21 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Seido, Way(DungeonKing) thinks: Test....subjects? - Sat Nov 21 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well, there's the Mizukage. He seems like a good test subject if you want a punching bag. Oh, there was another genin we just beat up a while ago. Not sure how useful he is since he's missing his tongue and eye now. - Sat Nov 21 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh, there's a bunch of kids here. - Sat Nov 21 07:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Let's see..Oh, there's a bunch in Sunagakure too. I wonder how strict the security is there though.. - Sat Nov 21 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Shiro, you said Sado was coming back right?  - Sat Nov 21 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'm sure our boss can help you if you're patient. He's pretty interesting. - Sat Nov 21 07:27:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'm sure he has no quams about being a test subject. - Sat Nov 21 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: He'll probably learn a thing or two with you. - Sat Nov 21 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: ....Mmmmm. - Sat Nov 21 07:32:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: By the way, by testing what do you mean? Are you a medic like Koeki was or something? - Sat Nov 21 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'm no medic. - Sat Nov 21 07:38:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Relationship? Oh her? Hm..I doubt it. - Sat Nov 21 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: She's heads over heels for Sado. The three of us just work together. - Sat Nov 21 07:45:29 2015
