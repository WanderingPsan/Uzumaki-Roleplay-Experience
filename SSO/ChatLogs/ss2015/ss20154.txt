<br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: H-Hanae. . .please? - Thu Nov  5 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Why... - Thu Nov  5 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: Y-You told me you'd do all the work the next time. . . - Thu Nov  5 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: If..I..Move..My..Legs..I'll..squirt... - Thu Nov  5 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: A-And? - Thu Nov  5 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) thinks: I want to see that. . . - Thu Nov  5 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I'm..So..hot..and...moist...I..feel..Like..Im..going..to...cum.. - Thu Nov  5 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Ooh~ - Thu Nov  5 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Not being able to control himself anymore, he'd move forward, attempting to grab the pillow and lay above her. His member again pressing into her stomach, probably the biggest it had even been. "H-Hanae, I-I need to do this. . ." saying such, he'd try to move in to kiss her. If sucessful, he'd reach down with a free hand to try and spread her legs open.* - Thu Nov  5 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her speak, it'd drive him even more, trying to get forceful, now reaching a hand to place on her knee, trying to slide it up her thigh and hopefully please her enough to where she'd be too weak to hold the pillow. Regardless of if this worked or not, he'd attempt to grab the pillow, and forcefully remove it. His mind already moving a few clicks towards full lust.* - Thu Nov  5 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Throwing the pillow to the side, his member pulsing a bit he was so lustful to get to her, he'd move his body to be above her, regardless of her hands blocking her, though, his member would be pushing against them, and with how much pleasure she was in, he was hoping this would drive her to want it. Though, not really caring about this, he'd move to look her in the eyes.

"H-Hanae. . .let's fuck. Just imagine how good it'll feel." saying such he'd move in to kiss her neck, nipping at it a small bit to tease her.* - Thu Nov  5 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Seeing what had just happened, and what she had said, he'd look down to her determined, "No. I'm going to be firm on this one. Move your hands." saying such, he'd push his member into her hands quite forcefully, trying to make her move them. Though, while he did this, a free hand would move to one of her nipples, pinching it quite hard, "Are you telling me after all the things you did to me, that you can't handle this? What? Afraid to break?" saying such, as he had obviously clicked over much faster to his unusual self because of the way Hanae was acting.

Again going to kiss her neck , his one free hand would rub from her chest, down to her tummy, and would tease her a bit, doing such over and over.* - Thu Nov  5 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Pulling his head back from her neck, he'd look at her, nothing but lust on his face. Reaching down, he'd attempt to forcefully remove her hands, not holding back anything at all, and more than likely even being stronger than usual as he was completely driven by his lust for her. If sucessful, even a little bit, he'd attempt to slide his member closer to her folds, if not in them somehow.

Once he had dont this, he'd move his mouth down to her nipple, literally biting down on it, and then licking it with his tongue, and going back and forth with such. One hand while he did this would go to her other nipple, and his last free hand would go to her mouth, teashing putting two fingers in it, "Here~ Just suck on these, it'll make everything better~"

Remy was obviously fully lost in lust.* - Thu Nov  5 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Aggravated with not being to get in her, he'd keep his mouth on her nipple, now moving both hands down to move her arms and hold them out of the way. If he could do this, he'd move his leg between hers, forcing them open, not caring for her flooding everywhere, he wanted to get an actual house anyway. If he could get them open, he'd slide himself into her hot, wet, slippery folds. Himself being bigger than usual, would probably be enough to drive her while beyond the edge.

If he could do this, he'd move to thrust all the way into her, and sit there for a moment as he moved to suck and bite on her nipple again. "Keep sucking on there~ It'll keep the moans down." saying such he'd rub his fingers in her juices and move to put them back into her mouth. 

Of course his one free hand would pinch her other nipple. 

Remy was longggg gone until this was all said and done.* - Thu Nov  5 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Starting to thrust into her, no caring if she was going to break or not, he'd go fast for a few thrust, before almost going to a dead stop, and would continue to do such to tease her, his ring making it easy to hold back. 

Continuing to move his fingers around in her mouth, he'd now use his free hand to go down to the clit ring, rubbing it slightly. "You like that don't you? You slut. Such a naughty girl, can't even control herself over a little ring. I'll make sure to fill you up and make you my cum dump~" saying such out of lust, the real Remy wouldn't be able to do any of that obviously, let alone say it.* - Thu Nov  5 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her moans and words, he'd already be close to the edge now. Thrusting into her as fast as he could at this point, he'd say, "You dirty little slut, take it, all of it." saying such, he'd continue his thrusting, lost with in it all. Though, in reality, his body would be screaming out to him from all from all of the moving he was doing, but he was too lost to realize it.

"Get addicted to my dick, I'll make sure you can't live without it." saying such, he'd continue to thrust, starting to twitch and pulse, as he'd suddenly come, so hard that the ring wouldn't be able help. It would simply if anything, raise the force of his cum as it had to be forced by it. Rushing into Hanae, she'd likely feel it actually hit her womb as he was likely to fill her up pretty well, coating her walls.

Panting at this point, everything catching up to him he'd say, "Get pregnant with my baby you little cum slut." this being the last bit he'd get out before his lust starting to die down.

Falling onto her, his body literally red from all of the damage he had done to it, he'd be sweating -too much- and breathing rather loud. His body would likely be off for a good couple days. Drooling a bit he'd say, "C-Cold bath. Soo-" passing out, he would have been saying such, because he had learned icing his body helped it.* - Thu Nov  5 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Lay atop of her, he'd have a bit of drool stuck to his face, his body still screaming. Barely opening his eyes, recalection of everything he had done coming back, "H-Hanae. . .I-I'm sorry." saying such, he'd pass out until one of them could move, hopefully doing something about the situation.* - Thu Nov  5 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) is still passed out, body basically toast.* - Thu Nov  5 08:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Getting put into a cold bath, and having his face smacked, he'd blink a few times, "H-Huh?" his entire body screaming in pain, "H-Hurts."* - Thu Nov  5 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Good your alive. - Thu Nov  5 08:19:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking down at himself, red and such, the ring having fell off he'd smile in pain, "I-I know. . .I-I remember. . " grunting he'd say, "W-Was it good?" obviously still worried if he was good enough.* - Thu Nov  5 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Yes it was Remy. - Thu Nov  5 08:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling somewhat better he'd say, "C-Can you help me out? M-Maybe someone is awake now."* - Thu Nov  5 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Okay. - Thu Nov  5 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Getting the robe on he'd say, "A-Are you ok?" saying such as he cringed himself.* - Thu Nov  5 08:27:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking at her, he'd gulp a bit. Watching as she exposed herself to him, he'd in turn have a tent pitched in his own bathrobe, "Y-You mean you just want to get right to it? S-Should I put mine one?" biting his lip after saying this he'd move closer to her.* - Thu Nov  5 16:31:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Gulping again, he'd move behind her, untying his own robe, he'd walk forward, his member already af full length. Lining himself up, he'd rub himself against her slightly, trying to tease her. Moving to rub it across the ring for just a slight second before moving back to line it up. Thrusing into her, he'd almost fall against her back, his body still having been a bit rough.* - Thu Nov  5 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling walls tighten around him, he'd cringe, having been a bit rubbed raw to begin with. Pulling all the way out of her, he's moan a slight bit, "Y-You're so tight. . .I-I told you it isn't a bad thing." saying such, he'd try grab her by her arm and turn her around so she'd be facing him, "T-Turn this way."

If she listened to him, he'd line himself back up, again pushing himself into the hot, wet, tight folds of hers. His mouth opening once he did this, as it to moan, nothing would get out as he was at a loss. 

Thrusting into her, he'd reach down, a hand going to rub the ring slightly as to see what it would do to her. His other hand trying to go to pinch her nipples again.* - Thu Nov  5 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Being that Hanae had wrapped around him, he'd hear what she said, along with the thrusting she was now doing, "B-But I want to enjoy it as long as I can. . ." saying such though, he'd twitch just a small bit, showing that he was feeling really good, and who knew how long he could last.

Moving his hands down to wrap around her ass, he'd squeeze it quite a bit, trying to slow down and enjoy and enjoy Hanae's folds. "Y-You feel s-so good that I never want to pull out. . ." saying such he'd move in to attempt to kiss her.* - Thu Nov  5 16:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Getting bitten, he'd moan loudly, somehow enjoying it this time. Her insides too much for him to handle, he'd start to thrust as fast as he could again. Hearing what she said he'd reply, "F-Fine, I'll you fill you!~" 

Saying such as he started to twitch, and pulse a bit, he'd give it one last big thrust, not being able to hold it anymore as he plastered her insides with his cum, "I-I told you it wasn't all bad." saying such, he'd lean into her, tired.* - Thu Nov  5 17:06:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) (*Hanae Stood there staring at Zenaki. Soon Hanae body would take on shaoe of a tall black shadow type figure. It had very long fingers that look like sharp claws. Its smile was big and its teeth were pointed and sharp. The inside of its mouth was puprle and had a slight purple ish vaper excaping from it. Her eyes were wide open, white circels and her ahir was just a black smoke that travel high into sky.

Zenaki was stuck inside the mist survant genjutsu but Beth is now able to increase the power her genjutsu letting her bend and mold them slightly..All the others figures would take on the same shape that hanae figure did.. To Zenaki it would seem all these figure swere getting closer and closer slowly. 

The figures feet, well the yhad no feet it seems just a black mist type vaper that seems to spirals around the floor. Every minute or so more figures would come creeping out from under the bed and other places in the room even the from the floors and ceiling..

"It surrounds us both the true evil we are. I have been rather nice lately again I'll give the chance to promise. That you wont kill your child or children and you will raise them be a mother to them."She said.*)

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Basically crying at this point, he'd move to get out of the bed, falling as he did so. Crawling up to Hanae and grabbing onto her leg he'd say, "D-Don't leave me. . ."  saying such, he'd full on have waterfalls for eyes at this point.

"I-I just didn't like the thought of you changing." trying to catch his breathe between crying now he'd say, "A-At the t-thought of it I went to the place where I fell in love with you. I-I went to the place w-with the most memories of how I want you. . ." crying a bit more he'd say, "B-But if you want to change, I-I can't stop you."* - Sat Nov  7 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Reaching up, and grasping at her clothing, only to lose his grip, and hit the floor again, he'd curl up, her foot in the middle of his body mass as he curled around it.

"D-Don't leave me. . .I-I love you too much. . .I-I-If you leave me. . .I-" cringing at the thought he'd hold onto her foot tighter, "D-Don't you love me?"* - Sat Nov  7 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her, he'd still be wrapped up around her leg, crying, mumbling over and over, "Don't leave me. . .Don't leave me. . .Don't leave me." in a very quiet manor, seemingly lost over the thought.

It would seem that the thought of it had triggered one of the biggest panic attacks Remy had ever had, skipping the usual phases he would normally show, and simply went straight to shutting down. He was so lost in the thought of her leaving him, that his brain had shut down anything it had deemed not needed, and simply worked the organs, and speech, though, only the same line of speech.* - Sat Nov  7 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Simply lets it happen, he was too shut down to do anything about it.* - Sat Nov  7 01:41:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) still panicing, he'd start to open back up, though he'd be shaking, "D-Don't ever leave me. . .H-How could you even suggest that. . ." crying again he'd mumble "I-I love you to much to be able to survive that. . ."

Pausing to wipe his own tears he'd say, "T-Though I g-guess I'm nothing but trouble for you anyway. . ." the tears starting again he'd say, "Y-You d-don't need trouble like me around a-anyway." sobbing even more he'd try to hide his face, thinking <I-I knew after my family all left that I deserved to follow them. . .a-and I haven't even summoned Koko in forever. . .I-I've cut all my bridges. . .a-and caused Hanae trouble. . .D-Do I deserve to be alive?>* - Sat Nov  7 01:49:39 2015

Feeling her on top of him, he'd finally wake slowly, though, being that he realized that something was going on, he wouldn't move. Feeling himself against her moist folds, he'd again moan, keeping his eyes closed, though, he couldn't deny he wanted in, so he'd move his hips just a tad towards her.

Then, hearing what she said, he'd tear up, he couldn't hold it anymore. Before she was done, he'd have tears running down his face. Though, as he felt himself go all the way into her, he'd moan again, tears still on his face, "H-Hanae. . .Y-You keep pulling my heart apart, and putting it back together. I-I might explode." saying such with a stupid smile on his face while crying, he'd try to wrap his arms around her now.

"You can have all of me, anything I can give you and more. I'll make sure of it." putting his face into her shirt he'd enjoy how it was feeling, but he was still emotional. Trying to cheer himself up, and make himself laugh he'd say, "D-Don't forget you have to wear girl underwear at least once in my life time so I can see." laughing, letting a few of the tears fall off, he'd feel like his heart was going to explode, he was beyong happier than he had ever been. * - Sat Nov  7 03:12:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her whisper to him he'd continue to thrust, not being able to help himself anymore, he'd reach down with one hand and lightly brush the ring, trying to hurry up and make her cum since he was close himself, "Oops~ Did I do that?"* - Sat Nov  7 04:38:36 2015

"I want to blow in you again~!" saying such he'd move to lick her ear a bit, whispering, "I know on the inside you're just a dirty whore, so ride me like you haven't had it in a long time, I want something amazing~!" teasing her, he'd lick her ear again.* - Sat Nov  7 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her bite down on his neck, he'd moan a bit, the pain getting to him. Though suddenly getting pinned down, and her sudden burst of speed when it came to slamming those beautiful hips down. Listening to the sound, he'd be even more turned on. "S-So good!"

Hearing her say she was cumming, he'd suddenly feel the juices cover him, and the tightening of her folds. Though, as she continued to slam her hips down, he'd grit his teeth, "I can't hold it!" saying such, he'd suddenly release into her again, coating her walls. Though, as she kept riding him, he'd grit his teeth, forcing himself to stay  Hearing what she had said, he'd basically get even harder.

Feeling her remove her mouth from her neck, he'd hear what she said, "Oh don't act like it's punishment you slut~ You know you want it done to you~" saying such, he'd lean forward, again bitting her ear, and teasing it with his own tongue, "I plan to fill all your wholes, and cover your body, but I'm going to make you do all the work to show how badly you want it~ You cum addict~"* - Sat Nov  7 06:17:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Shop is closed. - Sun Nov  8 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: - - Sun Nov  8 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Knowing what had happened the last time he tried something while the shop was closed, he'd simply stare at her ass while she wore them. Not being able to stop himself anymore, he'd quickly reach down his own pants, and would start to rub himself. 

After a few moments, he'd start to moan quietly. He didn't want her to know.* - Sun Nov  8 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: ZZzZZZzzzzZZzzz - Sun Nov  8 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing what seemed to be her asleep, he'd withstand the urge to touch her. He knew what would happen if he did. Thus, he'd simply look at her, and imagine all of the things he wanted to do to her while she wore those. Moaning out rather loudly now, as he had pulled his pants down and was now actively stroking himself, he'd let escape a rather loud moan, "H-Hanae!~"* - Sun Nov  8 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Still rubbing himself, he'd moan again, not even hearing her waking up, as he had his eyes closed as he envisioned the things he wanted to do, "H-Hanaeeeee~" saying such, he'd breathe rather heavily.* - Sun Nov  8 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Jerking himself off still looking at her he'd say, "I-I don't think I'm going to last long Hanae. . .a-and you wanted to watch so." saying such, he'd continue, almost about to blow.* - Sun Nov  8 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Go ahead. - Sun Nov  8 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: and stop. - Sun Nov  8 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Having stopped, he'd look to Hanae, who was kissing him, which he'd kiss back to. Once she broke away, he'd stare down to her soaking panties, and see the outline, and the ring, "H-Hanae I-I want to f-f-uc-" not being able to bring himself to say it he'd say, "I Want to put it in while you wear them. . ."* - Sun Nov  8 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) watching as she slid the the panties to the side, he'd drool a bit. Feeling her slide down onto him, he'd let out a rather loud moan. His eyes blanking out a small bit, and his mouth hanging open he'd get out.

"W-Why?"* - Sun Nov  8 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her ride him even faster, he'd moan out, some of Hanae's spit falling into his mouth. "H-Hanae! I-I can't take this!" saying such, he'd move to wrap his arms around her, unsure that he would be able to last much longer if she kept up the speed.

grunting a bit as well, because of back pain.* - Sun Nov  8 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her go even harder, he'd be close. The bed shaking, he'd moan out loudly. Feeling her cum, he'd almost do it himself, barely hanging on. Thinking he had made it, he'd feel her tighten up and go even faster. "H-Hanae!~"

Saying such he'd cum harder than he ever had, coating her walls and womb, filling it up to the top.* - Sun Nov  8 02:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I'm s-sorry. - Sun Nov  8 02:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Taking them, being that they were likely still wet, he'd blush heavily, turning away from her as he smelled them, heavily. At the same time he'd say, "D-Don't look." as he said it, he'd start to rub himself.* - Sun Nov  8 02:51:31 2015
