"E-Evvie. . .I-I. . .I haven't felt this way in a long time." saying such, he'd try and wrap his arms around her, "I-I'm sorry. . ."* - Mon Nov 23 07:30:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Feeling her arms wrap around him, he'd wrap his arms behind her head. Inserting his tongue into her mouth, he'd worm his tongue around. Feeling her grind against him, he'd move her kimono up a bit so that his member, under his pants, could rub against her panties.

Sighing out in pleasure in a break in the kiss he'd say, "It's been a long time since I've felt this way. . ."* - Mon Nov 23 07:51:28 2015

Reaching to one of her hands, he'd move it to his member, being pulsating and super hard.

Then, his hands moving to rub ontop of her underwear, rubbing her. His head moving down to kiss her neck.* - Mon Nov 23 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head, he'd grab one of her hands, FORCING her to feel his member. "It's not in yet. . .though this will be soon." saying such, he'd move to pull her shirt down, if she had a bra on, he'd find the way to uncolapse it, and move to her breast, groping and sucking on her nipples like he was a baby, needing milk badly.

"You are such a naughty girl, I'm glad I hired you first." saying such, he'd start to playfully like around her breast, and inbetween them, again working his way up to her lips, kissing her as his knee now went between her legs, pressing into it hard.* - Mon Nov 23 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly, he'd move to be on his knees, not even pulling her panties off as he moved them to the side. Lining himself up, he'd -very- slowly start to rub the tip around her entrance. Smirking at her he'd say, "Say you'll be mine. Forever. That you'll live here, and get paid with my dick instead of money." it was somewhat truth, somewhat dirty talk, he just wanted to see how she reacted.

Though, while he did this, he'd prod her a bit, putting in a small portion of his tip before rubbing it around her folds a bit, "I can't hear you~"* - Mon Nov 23 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd say, "You're going to be such a dirty, evil girl when I'm done with you~" saying such, he'd move to slowly, snails pace, insert himself into her, enjoying her tight, soaking wet, warn, folds as he did so, and her likely feeling the many veins, and shape of him as he entered her, and he wouldn't stop until he was literally knocking at her womb, trying to get in.* - Mon Nov 23 08:29:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to her, picking her up and taking her to the shower, he'd wash her down and put her in a robe, doing the same for himself, "You belong to me now, no matter what.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Sighing slightly, he'd shrug a bit, throwing his hands into his pockets, keeping his usual mixed look of apathy, and depression. "I'ma go then. . " saying such he'd try to walk off a bit.* - Mon Nov 23 20:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Let's roll.. - Mon Nov 23 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shakes his head slightly, looking to Kiyoko, "I'll talk to you. . .after this, alright?" saying such he'd look to the Kaze, shaking his head slightly before turning on a point, and running northward.* - Mon Nov 23 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: 9go fight - Mon Nov 23 21:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You shouldn't be next to me, you should be up there with them. - Mon Nov 23 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) whispers: I'm not leaving you alone in this. - Mon Nov 23 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being that he had been ordered to the area like everyone else, he'd of course be aggravted at the fact Kiyoko was a close as she was to the fighting. Though, deciding to hang back and watch over her, as of the moment she was the only direct means anyone had of being healed. Looking to the Kaze and Sanoke, he'd know that the two of them could handle most of the major fighting.

Having come to the conclusion that he needed to watch over Kiyoko, he wouldn't play around, he'd release the first stage of his power, allowing nature energy to start flowing into his body as half of him took on a change, darkening, and his right eye changing color as he body flooded with more power than usual. Having complete control over this stage, he'd stay in front of Kiyoko, aiming to keep his only friend safe.* - Mon Nov 23 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: This is good. Not everyone is clumped together in one spot, makes it harder to fight multiple people. - Mon Nov 23 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) whispers: You -will- stay behind me. Regardless of what happens. I will take you to the people who need help. - Mon Nov 23 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...okay. - Mon Nov 23 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) whispers: Dunno if you'd care ICly, but I am in stage one, holding it in control xD.) - Mon Nov 23 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: yeah i know you told me icly already and now are showing me] - Mon Nov 23 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) His eyes on the mass of fire coming at everyone's direction, he wouldn't exactly worry over them, he knew that everyone here for the most part would help each other out, and take on the attack, so in turn, his one worry would be Kiyoko, his one still human eye looking to behind the fire, curiout to what the army would do after, and his one changed eyed simply scanning.* - Mon Nov 23 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Would have of course stayed where he was, alert, now having bryson added to the fray, he'd grit his teeth a bit, not wanting to have the job to watch over anyone else aside from Kiyoko. Though, he'd try and manage if the time came.* - Mon Nov 23 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Retreating? Why? . . . - Mon Nov 23 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Gah. I don't want to charge in and fight all of those men myself. Hopefully I  can get some cover. - Mon Nov 23 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Turning back to look to Kiyoko, he'd simply nod, feeling that she was safe now that the enemy forces were retreating. Though, hearing Hassan's orders, something in him would be spark. Moving to leave Kiyoko's side, he'd start his way forward, his body still under a weird form as he was holding in the first stage of his transformation.

While he wanted to now join the battle, odds were he wouldn't get far enough forward to do anything before the army began its retreat.* - Mon Nov 23 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Who? - Mon Nov 23 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Seeing that he was no match to keep up, yad yada, he'd move back, huffing.* - Tue Nov 24 00:06:49 2015

Starting to stiffen he'd watch, wanting to do something, yet not wanting to interupt her, "Though, who is the one being bad now?~" asking such, his hands would go to rub up and down her thighs.* - Wed Nov 25 00:28:35 2015

"Though, Who knows how bad you really are. Not as much as me though~" saying such, almost as a joke, his evil aura would flare as his hands continued to rub her thighs.* - Wed Nov 25 00:36:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Quickly swallowing the food, he'd shrug, "Who knows. Though, I'm not sure if I'm hungry anymore." syaing such, he'd move a hand up to careress her face, leaning in to kiss her and prod his tongue into her mouth.

Breaking the kiss he'd say, "So, how bad of a girl are you?~" asking such, he'd look to her, "I'm not kidding when I say I'm straight evil~"* - Wed Nov 25 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Chuckling a bit, he'd move to stand, leaning forward to push her back onto the table. Grabbing at her breast and moving in to nip, and lick her nipples he'd say, "But you'll have to clean it after~" saying such he'd move a free hand down to inbetween her legs, -barely- rubbing it, trying to tease her as much as he possibly could.

Moving his head back up, he'd kiss on her neck, sucking on it heavily in attempts to leave a hicky, which he'd then follow up by biting it, "I want to mark you so everyone knows~"* - Wed Nov 25 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Raising an eyebrow, he was really curious now, "Oh? And why is that?" asking such, he'd suddenly move his knee to her folds, trying to rub against her panties. Holding her hands in place at the same time so she couldn't stop him. 

"Are you afraid of me?~"* - Wed Nov 25 00:59:18 2015
