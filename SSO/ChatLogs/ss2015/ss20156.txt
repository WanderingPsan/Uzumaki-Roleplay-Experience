<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Chuckling a bit he'd say, "If you would, attempt to anger me a tad more. . .it'll help things."* - Tue Nov 10 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Just start us off. - Tue Nov 10 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Sighing a bit he'd simply shake his head, "You don't understand. I'm doing this to release anger. I can't do that by simply starting. So if you would Ivel. Humor me."* - Tue Nov 10 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) getting hit in the face with an annoying tier ball of fire, he'd instinctively flinch away, biting his lip. "What an asshole." saying such, he'd bite his lip. He had been waiting for this, he was trying to empty himself out before he did it by accident. Thus, he'd let the flood gates open.

red-type marks forming over a portion of his body, he'd let out some weird grunt in pain, it slowly forming over him, before coming to a stop, one of his eyes now being a yellow and black color, and his skin turning a gray-brown. At the end of such, his body would be a good bit stronger, but his rage and blood lust had taken over. "I'll kill you!"

Saying such, he'd attempt to rush forward, only in the first stage of his transformation, before aiming to hit the boy in the gut.* - Tue Nov 10 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: The hell is going on with that guy? - Tue Nov 10 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) getting hit with with some Mario Bros type of shit, he'd be knocked back, burnt rather well. Though, it not registering with him, he'd let out a rather disturbing laugh. Moving from a kneeling position now, he'd again state, "I'll Kill you!~" letting that out, the marks would begin to move more, his built up anger starting to show itself more as the discoloration would move to his entire body.

Though this not being the only part, as multiple parts of his body would change, a feature on his head, and pipes on his back and such. (Imagine fully transed Jugo) Standing on his feet looking to the boy, he'd again rush forward, trying it once more, all sign of his usual calm personality gone, and now an even less intelligent, murderous one at the helm.

He of course, would go for a gut shot, again.* - Tue Nov 10 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) having his blow diverted, and even had a counter hit him in the face, he'd get knocked back once more, and to the ground. Though, if it wasn't obvious at this point, it wasn't going to end that easily. Hoping to his feet, giving quite a death glare to Ivel, he'd look down to his own right arm.

As he did this, it would morph a bit, a piston looking cylinder forming at his elboe. Now looking back to Ivel, he'd once more jump forward towards him, aiming to hit he boy in his own chin as a form of payback. 

"Die!~"* - Tue Nov 10 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: We // - Tue Nov 10 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Ha// - Tue Nov 10 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) thinks: Oi. Tickle my Dick, but I'm pretty sure I saw that dude with a gross fist about to kill Ivel. - Tue Nov 10 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) ignoring whatever pain came from the fire, he'd simply continue the strike, trying to at least make the boy budge, the piston like appendage aiding this effort. Though, regardless of any damage done, he'd jump back. Looking around. His primal mind looking for a way to damage the boy. Though, being surronded by a ring of fire, he'd only look be able to see the boy, and the fire.

Taking note of this, he'd turn on heel, aiming to run towards the fire wall, and hopefully through it, he wanted to kill someone, and it was obvious the boy wasn't a valid target. Though, he wouldn't make it to the fire yet, only towards the edge.* - Tue Nov 10 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Suddenly being trapped in a cube of flames, in his new higher pitched voice, roar out in anger. Looking to Ivel, he'd let a toothy grin form, his pointy teeth showing. Yelling out again, "I'll Kill you!" saying such, he'd take a few steps back.

Looking to the hole, he'd suddenly thrust his arm forward, the gray-brown appendage extending out of the hole, aiming to shoot out and wrap around Ivel's neck, though, he'd likely just wrap around the fire shroud and again, ignore the pain. "Die!!" Though, as it was likely he'd have no effect on the boy, the screaming he was doing would be pointless.* - Tue Nov 10 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: That doesn't look normal... - Tue Nov 10 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I got it! - Tue Nov 10 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) thinks: I think... - Tue Nov 10 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) thinks: Still trying to get the whole..."Burn without killing" thing. I guess practice makes perfect. - Tue Nov 10 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Go Funa Shuriken! - Tue Nov 10 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) his arm, having no effect would be pulled back, moving to what could be considered normal for this body. Glancing around every which was as the fore began to close in on him, he'd do the only thing that his murder filled brain could handle, he'd rush straight forward, aiming to break through the flames and charge Ivel. Though, likely buring the hell out of himself, and adding to the burns he already had.

If he made it through the flame, he'd of course be ignorant of the pain. Though, his body causing him to stumble, his form would again make his way forward towards Ivel. Though, suddenly getting hit with a giant shuriken in his back, he'd fall to his knees being that he had just torn his way through a wall of fire.

Again, ignoring this pain as his blood lust in this form, and lack of intelligence to tell him when to stop he'd stand up, continuing his approach. As if he lacked all knowledge of his previous attack on Invel, he'd again turn his arm into a piston like weapon, aiming again to hit the boy in the jaw.* - Tue Nov 10 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Because thats what it was in canon - Tue Nov 10 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being suddenly bound, by the clothe, he'd be imoblized. Raging out, looking to Ivel, he'd scream in quite a high pitched voice, "I'll Kill you!" stuggling against the clothes, but not being able to do anything. Being that he had been forcefully restrained, he'd start to calm down slowly.

His body slowly reverting back to the first stage, and then back to his normal self, though, still being burnt from all of the flame usage, he'd about be knocked out cold, in pain. 

Looking to the boy he'd say, "T-Thanks. I assume you kicked my ass?" being that he had little memory past the point he was hit in the face with the fire ball, "I need to release my anger or else I'll turn without wanting to." mumbling out such, he'd eventually just fall limp within the clothe, his skin reddened and ugly with burns.* - Tue Nov 10 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) still knocked out, he'd be set against the wall, still burnt and in pain.* - Tue Nov 10 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Good fight, though. - Tue Nov 10 04:36:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. He's knocked out. - Tue Nov 10 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Slowly comes to his senses, being that he was sat against the wall, he'd cringe, looking around. His skin, being burnt rather much, he'd simply say, "Guess I went a bit far by how I feel." saying such, he'd kinda just go limp there, now wanting to voice a complaint about how he felt being that he had asked for it.* - Tue Nov 10 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You got all crazy. -- Say. - Tue Nov 10 04:43:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to the man like he was crazy, he'd again cringe in pain as he had to look up, and he of course had burns on his neck, "N-No. . .that was me."* - Tue Nov 10 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Again cringing, as he was really feeling the burns now, and the man in front of him felt the need to ask stupid questions, he'd already find himself starting to be annoyed again, "No. Was just me." saying such, he'd let his head slump, not wanting to move.* - Tue Nov 10 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: OOoh! Well, uhm. You need to learn how to control that. No offense but. .  - Tue Nov 10 04:46:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Simply shakes his head, again gritting his teeth in pain, "You do realize, I'm burnt to hell, and you're annoying me. Do You want me to turn into a monster again?" saying such he'd then go on to think, <I almost wish I would, I'd rip your head off in the process.>* - Tue Nov 10 04:52:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being forcefully manhandled onto the man's shoulder, he'd grunt. Being in even more pain from the shitty treatment he'd simply grumble out sarcastically, "Oh joy, thanks."

Once he had, he'd cough a bit, "Let's just be on with it." saying such he'd now be quiet, not wanting to cause himself more pain.* - Tue Nov 10 04:59:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having sat in the hospital for some time, he'd be bandaged up, and given an ointment to put on the burns. Nodding at such, he'd leave.* - Tue Nov 10 05:15:44 2015

Looking back to Mitsunara now, he'd grit his teeth, slowly pulling off the bandages he had on, revealing semi-healed burns from his recent fight with Ivel. They covered most of his body. "I hope you're prepared." saying such, he'd mentally allow his angers flood gates open again, like he had done only a short time ago. 

A sudden burst of red marking would take over a part of his body, one of his eyes turning black and purple. His usual personality vanishing like it was never there. Now being replaces with murderous hate he'd say, "I'll kill you." his voice slightly high pitch now.

Moving forward, he'd try to close the gap between them, and hit her in the gut, his concern for the swords being non-exsistant.* - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'...Jiki, Marco. - Tue Nov 10 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Evening. - Tue Nov 10 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Have you tallied up what that armor is going to cost? - Tue Nov 10 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Don't get all beat up..you are suppose to spar me. - Tue Nov 10 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) His attack being diverted, and his arm being slashed into, he'd be cut open. Falling to the side into the sand, he'd bleed into his rather thick coat, soaking up all the blood.

His anger now raising even higher as it was clear he wasn't going to get an attack on the girl, the markings on his body would suddenly spread even more, turning him into a full blown monster. (AKA Jugo trans 2) his skin taking on a new color, along with his eyes, and his hair moving to be longer. An even worse personality taking over now, he'd turn to look at Mitsunara, "You'll die." saying such in quite a high pitch voice, he'd move to stand.

His right arm suddenly changing shape, a piston like shape would form at his elboe as he dashed forward, again aiming to get the gut shot he was aiming for before.* - Tue Nov 10 05:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Not quite yet. - Tue Nov 10 05:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) His eyes having been darting all over Mit he'd get hit in the jaw line as he had hit her. Ignoring any sort of pain here, he'd bring his fist back again, looking to the weapon. sending it forward, he'd aim to connect with the weapon, attempting to shatter it.

If he did this, he'd again roar out, a load amount as he was no longer his normal self, "I'll Kill you!" again said in a high pitch voice, he'd hope to continue the hit all the way down the blade, aiming for the hand that was holding it.


If he connected with this, he'd ignore any damage done to his own hand.* - Tue Nov 10 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Hmm.. Yan's going to do something? He has no idea... - Tue Nov 10 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Spar -- turned death match. - Tue Nov 10 06:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) being that his hand hand broken her sword, and hit her in the chest, he'd already be bringing his other arm up. His eyes catching sight of her hands moving in a direction towards his neck, he wouldn't take any chances, being that his eyes werent fast enough to catch if they were holding a weapon or not.

Catching sight of this movement, he'd quickly shoot his arm upwards towards them, trying to knock them even slightly to the side, and he himself moved in the opposite way, trying to avoid whatever it was that she was holding, or doing, or at minimum, escape with a small wound.

If he was sucessful, he'd be over a good amount of space, staring her down, wanting to go back.

If he wasn't? Well, we all know.* - Tue Nov 10 06:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being that he had his neck cut into, and was bound, he'd continue to ignore the pain, his murderous personality at the healm, screeching out in a high pitch voice he'd say, "Let me go!" struggling as his body slowly started to revert, no longer able to move.

Turning back to his normal self, he'd look to Mit blankly, "I-I'm sorry." before passing out within the binding.* - Tue Nov 10 06:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I gotta respect that, even if he did.. try to kill me. - Tue Nov 10 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Still passed out durning all of this process, he'd let out small noises of pain while being healed. His chakra levels would have plumeted back down to the normal levels.

Kiyoko would see slight bruising on his face, a cut into his arm, and of course the cut into his throat. Though something new would apprear. It would seem he had been in a battle not long before this one, and would have signs of healing burns over most of his body.

Once he eventually woke up, if he did while still in the area, he'd look to Kiyoko, "I-I Assume I lost? W-What happened? I-Is she okay?" though as he said all of this, he'd only be hurting himself more.* - Tue Nov 10 07:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Coughing a bit more at this point, he'd almost begin to cry, a tear forming at the edge of one of his eyes. "D-Did I do it again?" afraid that he had hurt someone to the point where he'd have to leave once more.

Shaking his head he'd say, "A monster in a sense. . .I can't control it." saying such, he'd lay back, in too much pain to say much else at this point, only coughing occasionally.* - Tue Nov 10 07:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing what Kiyoko had said, the tear would roll down his face, Nari would be upset if he was allowed to go home and he had to explain what had happened to her. Though, looking up to Kiyoko, he'd cough again, "Aza."

Saying such, he'd look to Koji, trying to hold back more tears at this point, "Y-Yea?" saying such in his normal kind voice.* - Tue Nov 10 07:33:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to Kiyoko, he'd laugh slightly, though, his eyes still watering, "You remind me of my mo-" though thinking of the word mom would only drive him closer to sadness. Obviously he had something to do with her death.

Though speaking to Mit now, somewhat loudly so she could hear it, "I-I'm sorry." not saying anything else to her, feeling he didn't deserve to.* - Tue Nov 10 07:37:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Simply listening to Koji, he'd shake his head. Agreeing with what most of he said, simply mumbling, "I didn't mean to let it take over." saying such, he'd rub his eyes a bit, still not wanting to move. Though, looking to him he'd say, "It's not exactly within myself. . .it's hard to explain." pausing as he breathed deeply, he didn't want to think about it.

"I don't need a specialist. . .I just need Nari around. . .it's because she wasn't that this happened." saying such, he'd cringe, he knew once she found out that she'd be mad with him.

Of course, mumbling again he'd say, "I can't believe I did it again. . .twice in one day." again, having a tear come to his eyes he'd look to Koji, "I-I'm sorry." saying such, he'd look over towards Kiyoko and Mitsunara. Seeing that the Doc was obviously working, he'd be upset, and worried, and this, would try to get to his feet slowly. Though, likely only causing himself pain in the process, having already been through a beating before this one.* - Tue Nov 10 07:52:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Slowly forcing himself to his feet now, he'd nod to Koji, showing that he had no intent to do any more fighting without Nari around, he'd grunt a bit, stray tears on his face, "I-I'm sorry." it was obvious that this transformation was linked to some bad memories for him at this point in his life.

Slowly, and painfully making his way towards Mitsunara and Yan, he'd walk past Kiyoko, "Only if they are with you. . .y-you remind me of someone." saying such, closing his eyes, as if to push a memory away, he'd continue until he was in front of Mit.

Bowing low, and letting out a grunt of pain, as the burns he had all over his body were still hurting him, yet faint now, he'd say, "I-I'm truely sorry. . I-I didn't think I'd lose it twice in a day. . .I-I. . ." trailing off, tears again on his face.

If was obvious that the usually calm, and collected normal Aza was gone for now. This whole incident had made him remember things that upset him, and caused him to be more saddened than usual.* - Tue Nov 10 08:08:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) unable to bring himself to respond, he'd nod, turning back towards Koji and Kiyoko. "N-No need for it to be Mandatory. I'll go of my own will. . .as I said, Nari was simply asleep. . .I was stupid to leave the house. . .and even more stupid to get badgered into being angered." saying such, as he'd be more likely to do it of his own free will. If it was mandatory, he'd be more likely to want to not go.* - Tue Nov 10 08:11:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to Kiyoko, he'd nod, "H-How many times do I need to come see you? Nari might get jealous. . .even if it's to help me." saying such, he'd rub his neck. Moving to wip his face with his other hand, he'd try to bring himself back to how he normally was. 

"P-Plus. . .I-I'm not even sure I can work on it. . .having Nari around keeps me calm is all. . ." saying such he'd look to the sand below his feet.* - Tue Nov 10 08:20:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking between the two of them he'd simply say, "C-Can we just do it now then? I-I don't even want to do it that often. . .I-I just want to stay home now."

Finally calming himself down, his face would somewhat form back to his usual look, which still wasn't a happy one, but his voice would be a small bit more cheerful. "It just happens sometimes. . .It just kinda builds up." saying such he'd shake his head.

"I know I'm a monster. . .Nari calms me and distracts me from it. . ." saying such he'd frown, more unpleasent memories of the things that had happened before his met Nari popping into his head.* - Tue Nov 10 08:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his own head, he'd plop down into the sand, staring into his lap. "I'm fine. . .I-I'm used to this feeling now. W-We can start now." saying such he'd fidget with his shirt. 

"I only have a basic understanding. . .M-My parents told me about it." mumbling such, he wouldn't say much more, not wanting to say such in front of anyone really, only to another person one on one -if- he had to.* - Tue Nov 10 08:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm sorry but I refuse, you are stuttering and as I saw you speaking earlier that isn't a natural occurance to you, meaning you still have nerves bundled up in high gear. - Tue Nov 10 08:41:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing her talk about sleep, and then Koji backing her up, he'd shake his head, "Sleep isn't go after this. . .but I'll go home." saying such, he'd stand to his feet, "There isn't a way to calm me. . .Nari is just. . .Nari." saying such, he'd smile stupidly at the thought of her.

Somewhat cheered up by the thought of the only person he loved that was left alive he'd move to stand, "Nari is my girlfriend. Having her around is simply. . .calming." saying such he'd pause for a moment, "If she were gone. . ." clenching his fist a bit, not wanting to think about it, he'd shake his head.

"I don't need that thought. . ." saying such he'd move on, "I-I'm sorry for what I did. . .but you can blame most of it on nature." saying such, as one of the only hints he had been given about what he was, he wouldn't say much more other than, "I-I'll explain when there are less people about."* - Tue Nov 10 08:49:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to the sand again, he'd open the water, going to take a sip. Still destressed over everything he'd say, "I-I guess I should go now." Then looking to Koji he'd say, "Please stop with the talk of water. . .it's aggravating. . ." saying such, he'd have a bit of a depressed look as he made his way to walk towards the exit.* - Tue Nov 10 08:57:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) hearing her agree, he'd simply nod, "Follow me." saying such, he'd begin to walk off to the north-east.* - Tue Nov 10 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Walking into his home, holding the door open for Kiyoko, he'd move to the table, sitting one one of the mats on the floor, "Make yourself at home I guess." any sign of the saddened, or happy version of himself now gone, a more apathetic version taking over.* - Tue Nov 10 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) watching Kiyoko look his home every, she'd see it basically clean, and bare of anything fancy. He couldn't afford to get anything better than the basic items.

Watching her sit, he'd already start to be annoyed. He was a bit angered at the fact he was forced to go through with this, but, he'd shake it off for now, "Well. . .?"* - Tue Nov 10 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) shaking his head a bit he'd say, "I get annoyed easily, and then angered. It's not that I don't want to do this, it's simply I already assume I know how it'll end." sighing again, he'd rub his neck, "Why offer this to me anyway? Why be so nice?" gritting his teeth a bit, assuming she just wanted something out of him as well, no one could be that nice. Thinking about this over and over, his anger would build slightly, for what was likely a pointless reason.* - Tue Nov 10 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly, not wanting to believe it. He had met nice people, sure, but once they had seen what he was, they usually turned around and become someone else towards him. He was unsure on how to react to all of this, and in turn would simply lean back against the wall, biting his lip, his anger still a bit present, "And why choose to be that way?"

Sighing once more, he'd clench his fist again. He'd already want to blow off steam, but of course, that would in turn cause more trouble, so for now he'd suck it up and look to the table, refusing to meet her eyes, feeling that if he did, she'd see the amount of anger he held inside of himself.* - Tue Nov 10 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head, he'd somewhat denie her, "My life is as balanced as it will ever get." saying such he'd think more on her words, "Even actions can't prove intent. People fake things all the time." speaking from experiance, he'd again sigh.

Clinching his fist once more he'd find himself annoyed with all of the talking, and beating around the bush, "If you want to help me. Get to it. I don't exactly care about you." though, flinching at his own words, being that she did remind him of his mother, he'd simply think, <Better to have her away from me.>

Now glaring at her, trying his best to keep his annoyance, and anger hidden, he'd hope that she'd leave. If his past was any sign of the future, anyone aside from Nari was in a bad way around him.* - Tue Nov 10 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) watching her hand raise, and the tremble it had, he'd shake his head, this was what he was used to. "As I said, I am a monster." Now pushing his anger down, likely to let it build on the next person who annoyed him, he'd hold it back for Kiyoko, "It's better you not try to help me. You'll end up hurt, or worse." saying such quite apathetically, he'd have a flashback for a second, his eyes going blank as he was forced to remember everyone he had hurt. 

Shaking his head, removing the memories from his thoughts he'd say, "People who try to help me never make it far, so you're safer if you don't try." saying such again to try to make it clear to her that she was a person she didn't want to hurt, at least as of this moment. Of course, a side of him was clawing to rip her apart, but he would keep it contained for now.

The moment she mentioned how helpless she was, of course didn't help. His body, always absorbing nature chakra, mixed with his hidden intent to kill, would drive him a bit crazy mentally. Putting his hands under the table, he'd dig his finger nails into hia hands, "You might want to go." saying such, as if it was anyone else, he'd already would have likely smashed their head in. Though, as stated before Kiyoko had a connection by her actions to his mother in his mind. Thus, he'd give her a chance.* - Tue Nov 10 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head, gritting his teeth, a big part of him wanted to kill her. Though, the small shred of him that loved Nari knew that if he messed up again, he'd be jailed, or worse, killed. Thus, grabbing onto the table now, cracking it in his grasp he'd say in quite a stressed mannor, "Leave. G-Get someone who can stop me." saying such, he'd force himself to be seated. An overwhelming urge to kill the girl beside him starting to bubble up.

All the anger he usually had hidden inside of him, along with the power that his body could harbor, would start to make it's appearence. A red glow would start to make its way over his body, coming from his shoulder, and moving towards his face. He was starting the first stage of his transformation.

His anger about to explode out, he'd let one last word escape his mouth before it happened, "Go." anger and annoyance stressed with said word. It would seem all of the talking, and all of the memories he had gone over in his head, along with the thought of Kiyoko being another liar, regardless of what she tried to show him. It might be obvious that it would be -near- impossible for a normal person to help him somehow drop his anger and want for killing. 

Of course, those feelings were usually hidden deep within himself when left alone.* - Tue Nov 10 20:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) being that he was now having the markings come over him, part of his true personality would come out, his left eye now a black and yellow. Taking a time to get his bairings, he'd look to the table, roaring out in anger.

Slowly lumbering to his feet, he'd catch sight of Kiyoko. She seemed like a fine target now that all of his reasoning was gone. Though, along with his reasoning, was also any intelligence that he once had. Thus, he wouldn't make the connection that he could simply jump onto the table. 

Thus, pushing against it pointlessly, he'd grin, realizing that he was doing something stupid, he'd make to walk around the table towards her.* - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Now, being around the table, he would have thought he could have gotten to her, not even registering that she was running, as he was too lost to take more into account aside the fact he wanted to kill. Thus, rushing forward as she turned the corner, he would have charged, though, her slipping would have saved her, as he flew over her, and slammed now into the couch.

Likely breaking it, he'd slowly move to get back to his feet, staring at Kiyoko, too far lost within his rage to realize what he was trying to do.* - Tue Nov 10 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing the scream, it would only drive him to want to kill the girl more. It was clear any sign of what he had been was gone for the time being. All the energy that had entered his body was forcing him to act out to his feelings, amplifying them. Feeling that she had no where to go now, being as he didn't even take account of there being a door there, he'd make his way towards her, walking, very horrr movie like.* - Tue Nov 10 21:25:58 2015

Once he had gotten to her, he'd grin, now sharpened teeth showing themselves. The beast that he now was, would decide to toy with the girl. Reaching forward with the hand that was still human, grabbing her by the neck, and would attempt to throw her into the non-existant wall that he thought was behind her, only to literally toss her out of his house. Of course, he'd follow after her once he realized this.* - Tue Nov 10 21:30:14 2015
