<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Listening to what the girl had said, he'd awkwardly remove his shoes, moving to the only chair in the room, and putting his hands between his legs, somewhat nervous, "A-ah, yea, I am. . ."* - Thu Oct 29 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: . . . - Thu Oct 29 02:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Who is that? - Thu Oct 29 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) A small smile forming, he'd slowly, and quite hesitantly bring his hand to his mouth, bitting his thumb, and ripping the skin quite easily. Putting his hand to the ground, he push his chakra forward, inacting his summoning.

With a puff of smoke a small gray Koala bear would be where the smoke had formed. The bear, crawling up his arm slowly would rub his face into Remy's.
Looking to Beth, Remy would say, "This is KoKo. . ." saying such, he'd have a very girly, happy look on his face as he rubbed his own into Koko's.* - Thu Oct 29 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to Hanae he'd smile, looking probably the cutest he probably could look, "Yea, she is. Isn't she?"* - Thu Oct 29 02:28:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) saying such, he'd look to the side, avoiding Hanae's gaze.* - Thu Oct 29 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: So cute. - Thu Oct 29 02:30:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing this, he himself would blush, looking away even more, cuddling his Koala quite tightly, "N-nu uhhhh."* - Thu Oct 29 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: -clears throat- - Thu Oct 29 02:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Having Koko attached to his arm, he'd look to the floor, rubbing his hands together between his legs, "W-whatever you have. . ." never actually having drank tea before, but he wasn't gonna say such.* - Thu Oct 29 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Taking the cup carefully, he'd look at it, and then to Beth, waiting for her to drink first, only giving a slightly nervous look.* - Thu Oct 29 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: amazing things - Thu Oct 29 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to the cup after Beth had sipped from it he'd bring his own cup to his lips, testing it a bit, he'd find it surprisingly good, mumbling without meaning to, "This is so good. . ." 

Though, hearing Hanae speak, he'd blush heavily, moving Koko to cradle her, "N-No I don't. . ."* - Thu Oct 29 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Yes you do. - Thu Oct 29 02:46:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Quickly looking to his tea, he'd avoid saying anything else, drinking down his tea as fast as he could, putting the cup on the dressed, Koko clutching onto him, "T-Thank you for the tea."* - Thu Oct 29 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Not a problem. - Thu Oct 29 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: So Remy what do is it you want to do for a living - Thu Oct 29 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Nodding, he'd move to hold Koko like a baby, moving back to the chair, "N-nothing. . ." saying such with shame, he'd look to Koko, frowning while rubbing her head.* - Thu Oct 29 02:51:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Frowning, a tear almost coming to his eye, he'd force himself to stay calm, even though it sounded like Hanae had been having a hard time til now, "I-I'm sorry."

saying such he'd rub his neck a bit, holding Koko out he'd say, "W-wanna hold Koko? S-she makes things better. . ."* - Thu Oct 29 03:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Taking it he'd set Koko to the side, looking at it curiously. Rubbing his neck with a free hand, he'd then hold the paper with his finger tips.

Pushing his chakra to it, the paper would suddenly burst into flame. Panicing, he'd throw the piece of paper to the side. "W-Wha!!"* - Thu Oct 29 03:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Seeing her turn, he'd feel a bit awkward, turning to the other direction to have his back to her, and let his feet off the bed, "N-Nineteen. . .even though everyone things I'm a kid. . ."* - Thu Oct 29 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Cool, I'm nineteen too. - Thu Oct 29 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her spreak, he'd blush, heavily, having a hard time thinking of what to say, replying to the first sentence with, "T-Thanks." though, pausing to rub the back of his neck.

Moving on to feeling her foot against his ankle, he'd flinch, heavily, as he hand't even really touch another person in awhile, and he hadn't expected. This, coupled with her statement about being nervous, he'd basically flinch -off- of the bed, falling.

Hitting the floor, he'd have the air knocked out of him, as it didn't take much. Coughing he'd get out, "N-N-No I'm not."* - Thu Oct 29 03:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Blushing quite heavily as he continued to cough he'd say, "I-I'm not offended. . .Just . . .surprised." saying such he'd attempt to get back up to the bed to sit, having a hard time of doing such.* - Thu Oct 29 03:51:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Finally getting back up to the bed he'd speak, still blushing, "I-It's been a while. . and I get hurt easily, so people don't touch me usually. . .because I get afraid. . .and. . .w-what you said embarrassed me. . "* - Thu Oct 29 03:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Flinching again, as he felt her hand on his lap, he's blush heavily. Though, as she had predicted, as she tried to make eye contact, he'd try to look away, and would have his face grasped. Flinching again, at this touch, he'd have his face forcefully turned towards hers. Though, blushing heavily, he wouldn't let it go any further, as he simply cut his eyes to the side, still refuses to make contact.

Hearing her talk, Just the opposite would happen, he'd have a mini-panic attack, his breathing picking up, and his heart beat raising. He wasn't used to being touched, much less held in place. Closing his eyes to try and block everything out, it was obvious he was having some sort of issue, being that he simply needed to calm down, and couldn't do it from his own power.* - Thu Oct 29 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her hands be removed, he'd have his eyes still closed, his feet rolling up into his chest as he accidently rolled forward, and likely ended up in a position where he'd have his head rested on Hanae. 

Ignoring this though, as he was blocking everything out, his breathing would be a bit heavy, still in a small panic.* - Thu Oct 29 04:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Having been having a bit of a panic attack, he wouldn't realize where his head had landed, though feeling her hands, he'd tense up more, still not used to being touched. Though, she was gentle about it which helped. Feeling his head turned again, "He'd slowly open his eyes, a tear forming at the end of one. Not sure what was going on, he'd simply watch in confusion as she leaned closer, pressing her lips to his, and easily getting her tongue into his mouth. Though, his eyes going wide, not realizing what was happening, he'd try to break away after a few moments, "W-What!?" confused about everything that had just happened, his face red from a mixture of his panic attack, and the kiss.* - Thu Oct 29 17:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Blushing heavily, a mix of too many things going on at once, from his nervousness, and the kiss, he'd look away, laying onto the bed, and trying to hide his head and face under the pillow, not even remembering that this wasn't his room, just confused about so many things.

"I-I d-do not." saying, he'd advert his eyes, and head entirely.

"I-I S-Still don't see w-why you'd kiss me."* - Thu Oct 29 18:28:28 2015

His heart beating faster, as he took it as a sign something was wrong he'd try to stand, "M-Maybe I should go." saying such he'd try to move back to the chair where his shoes were, unsure which was worse, his embarrassment, or the fact he was panicing over someone touching him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her hand on his shoulder, he'd nod a small bit, trying not to panic.

Laying back onto the bed, he was worried, because he still wasn't sure what was happening, closing his eyes, trying to relax as he was still quite nervous.* - Thu Oct 29 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling the change of weight on the bed around him, he'd clench his eyes a bit tigher, worried about what would happen. Hearing her statement he'd nod back a bit.

Feeling her lips against his, and then her tongue, his face would turn blood red, small gasps of breathe being released. His tongue, by accidenly, probably hitting hers at least once or twice.* - Thu Oct 29 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her tongue wrapping around his, the heartbeat would pick up, feeling her hand on his chest, she'd likely feel it beating ridiculously fast.

As she pulled away, his face would twist, a bit of saliva still hanging on his lips as his mouth was left open, face blood red, eyes somewhat closed, Quite a girly face of pleasure and confusion. "W-What?" though as he was a bit out of it, it'd take him a bit to register what she had said, slowly moving his hands to her hips.

Getting kissed again, he'd just go with the flow.* - Thu Oct 29 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: -omit- - Thu Oct 29 19:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) continuing to kiss her, he'd feel her hand move down him. Feeling where it was going, he'd try to break the kiss, "W-What are you doing?"  though by the time he had said it, his pants had already been undone.

Panicing, he'd fidgit a bit, trying to stop her, "T-This is weird isn't it?" actually confused.* - Thu Oct 29 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) thinks: W-Why would she redo my pants. - Thu Oct 29 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) thinks: *Undo - Thu Oct 29 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her hand on his chest holding him there, he was assuming that he'd be let go after she spoke. Though, hearing the way she said relax, he'd start to squirm more, hurting his own body in the process. 

"L-Let go. . .it hurts."

saying such he'd basically ignore the second thing she had said, only feeling her hand on crotch, and the squeeze. While his body would react the obvious way, by causing it to stiffen up a small bit he'd say meekly, almost feeling like he was about to cry, and he wasn't sure why.* - Thu Oct 29 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling himself being rubbed, and then the hand slipping into his boxers, his body would likely already have caused him to be at full length. Bringing his hands back, he'd cover his own face, though, his hands would be moved as Hanae went to kiss him again.

Trying to turn his head away he'd meekly say, almost is a voice that would sound like he'd been crying, "I-Isn't this rape? M-My parents told me about this when I was little."

Wiggling around a bit more, he'd continue to hurt his own body, which in turn would cause his breathing to pick up, and eventually make him just lay completely still, his body confused by the pain, and the pleasure that were happening at the same time.* - Thu Oct 29 19:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Finally moving to sit up now that he was free, he'd watch Hanae as her eyes started to water up. Listening to what she said he'd say, "I-It's fine. . .I-I've just never been touched like that before. . .it scares me some." saying such, feeling terrible being that Hanae was simply trying to show him something pleasurable.

Watching her lay back, he'd find himself somehow attached now. He didn't know why, but something in him clicked a small bit, even if he was frightened by the situation. Moving in, he'd wrap his arms weakly around her, his head going to her flat chest where he heart would be, laying it there lovingly, "I-I'm fine with it. . .j-just don't hurt me too much. . ."* - Thu Oct 29 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Holding onto her as hard as his thin arms would let him he'd say, "Y-You can't do that to me. . .getting me going and emotional. . .and say you need air. . ." saying such, a few tears would come to his eyes, "Y-You're the only one who has tried to touch me and help me." saying such he'd try to move up and kiss her, failing heavily, being that he had never intiated a kiss before.

Frustrated by his mess up, he'd move back to the pillows, holding it in his arms for comfort, "I-I'm just not good enough am I?"* - Thu Oct 29 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Watching as his pants were removed, he'd nod a small amount, his heart picking up pace again. "I-I. . ." pausing unsure what he really felt, as everything was weird right now he'd say, "I think I like you too Hanae." saying such,he'd blush heavily and tried to look away, not being able to make eye contact with her.

Though hearing her next sentence he'd simply look in her direction, avoiding eye contact, "I-I Think I want to be around you too. . ." saying such he'd put his hand to his heart, "M-my Heart keeps going fast. . .please try not to hurt me by such much." saying such being that the way his body was, he was likely to get hurt regardless.* - Thu Oct 29 20:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) having his boxers removed, he'd again look away, too embarrassed as he stood there, his body weak. Hearing her say she wouldn't hurt him, he'd nod a small amount. Though, watching as she removed her clothing, he'd blush even more, even if her body was a bit manly. 

Watching as she moved to be above him, he'd literally shake a small amount from the pressure of his heart beating. "I-I've never done this. . " saying such, he'd feel her hand grab at him, lining him up. Gulping down air at the feel, he'd close his eyes a bit, readying himself. Feeling himseld start to slide into her, he'd have basically a look of complete bless take over, his face reddening, biting his own lip a small amount. Though, embarrassed by this, he'd try to hide his look, grasping for anything to hide his face.* - Thu Oct 29 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) blushing as her first word he'd say, "Y-You mean this is only the start?" saying such, he'd feel himself get covered by something warm and soft. Hearing her moan, he'd respond himself, letting out something probably even worse, a soft, yet high pitch noise that he'd let out. 

Feeling her ride him, he'd look up to Hanae, covering his forehead with one of his hands, "W-Why does it feel like this?"* - Thu Oct 29 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her kiss, he'd melt a small bit, only able to enjoy the feeling he was having. He was literally a bit broken at this point. Though, with her slowing down, it would have the reverse effect of what she wanted. Slowly moving his own hips a small bit as to try and get back the intense feeling he had before.

"I-It feels g-good." pausing, his face looking like lust at this point he'd stop his hips, trying to hold back, "S-Something feels werid." saying such as this -was- his first time, it would be unlikely that he'd last much longer, but on the flip side, nineteen years of waiting, it'd also be likely he'd be able to last more than one round easily.* - Thu Oct 29 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her whisper he'd gasp a bit, grabbing at the sheets, "S-Somethings going to come out. . .S-stop." saying such, he'd go to wrap his arms around Hanae's back, needing someone to hold on to as he felt like he'd drift away if he didn't. 

Feeling her speed up, he'd be basically on the edge, digging his fingers into Hanae's back much like a girl would to a guy, "I-It's about to. . " * - Thu Oct 29 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her moan, he'd sorta know what was coming, as it was explained to him as a child that letting something out in a girl made kids. Afraid of having children, as he didn't want anyone cursed with his type of body, he'd suddenly focus in a bit, "S-Stop." though hearing her moan his name, he'd feel like he was going to burst. Quickly pulling his hips back, he'd hopefully barely get out of her.

Though, when doing this, he'd cum, -hard- covering Hanae's stomach a -small- bit, but, instead, covering himself in it, his pale body would have specs of his own juices. While he had came he'd somehow still be hard, "I-" trailing off in a bit of lust now, all reason that he had moments ago gone.* - Thu Oct 29 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her grabbing him again, he'd once more reach up, hands going around her back, as he was feeling sensitve, "T-T-Too good." saying such he'd feel her slide down onto him again, his face twisting in girly lust, "I-I want to kiss you." saying such he'd look to her longingly.* - Thu Oct 29 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her tongue moving into his mouth, he'd push his own forward, not even sure what he was doing anymore, as his personality was burried, only replaced wirth lust. Using one of his arms, he'd move to push her off from her chest, probably accidently rubbing her nipple too if that did anything for her, "I-I might get a-addicted. . .is t-that bad?"

Saying such, he'd reach up and wrap his arms around her, trying to pull her as close as physically possible, though, being frail, he wouldn't really be able to move her, she'd just feel the pressure. He was currently a bit lost in what was happening.* - Thu Oct 29 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) being that she had moved, he'd move to be above her, "I-I'm not sure what to do." though saying such, he'd line it back up, having a hard time before finding it. Sticking himself in, he'd move slowly at first, getting the hang for what he could do without hurting himself. Though, after a moment, he'd speed up, knowing he'd be sore from it later.

While thrusting into her, he'd lay on top of her somewhat, not like his body weighs much, putting his head and mouth near her neck, breathing heavily.* - Thu Oct 29 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling his head played with, he'd almost lose his strength, apparently having his hair played with, and his back touched were two of the most enjoyable things Remy could experiance, aside from what was happening now. Hearing her words in his ear he'd say, "H-Hanae. . .I-I can't." feeling a bit weak, he'd fall, only thing still being able to move being his hips as he felt himself in estacy again. 

Head beside her neck, he'd start to let out weird noises again himself, and in attempt to stop this, he'd bite onto Hanae's neck, not even realizing he was doing it.* - Thu Oct 29 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling his hair grabbed, he's like out another girly like moan, his teeth coming off of Hanae for a short moment before digging in even more, trying to stop himself, too embarrassed. Continuing to thrust, being he was already sensitive, he'd be about close to letting loose again, his member swelling up a bit more as he heard her moans.* - Thu Oct 29 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: I'll have to toss these sheets~ - Thu Oct 29 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling Hanae arc her back, he'd keep doing his best feeling the sudden pressure on him, and the wetness, he'd be about to lose it. Hearing her call his name, he'd feel it get even wetter, causing him to be literally on the edge. 

Feeling too good, he'd lose his grip on Hanae's neck with his teeth, moans filling the room as he was basically out of energy, his body sore all over. Though, feeling himself approach again, he'd start to let out an even louder moan, but would stop himself by clamping back onto Hanae's neck, probably drawing a small drop or two of blood. 

Quickly thrusting his hips in one last time, he'd explode inside of her, releasing a good amount of hot white liquid into her, though keeping it in her, he'd collapse ontop of Hanae. Being that this was the first time he'd ever been through any of this, he'd likely be able to keep going with some 'coaxing' but, it was really up to Hanae if she decided to keep going or not.* - Thu Oct 29 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling basically out of strength, he'd stay hard inside of her for a few moments, he'd soften up, being that no more stimilation was given to it. Breathing heavily, he'd hear what she said.

"I-I can't move. . .my body hurt. . ." saying such between breathes, he'd feel her hand on his back, letting out a small moan as that again, was a really good place for him.* - Thu Oct 29 23:51:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) wanting to know what she had in mind, he'd frown a bit, thinking <I-I want to feel good still. . .> but, knowing that Hanae had already shown him something amazing, he'd simply hide his face back behind her neck, not wanting her to see that he was upset.* - Thu Oct 29 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: . . . - Fri Oct 30 00:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Having his hair and his back having fingers running over them, he'd moan again, "I-It does hurt. . .b-but it felt good. . .and s-s-do does this. . ." saying such, he'd continue to his face, his arms going to rest around Hanae's hips, as he no longer had the strength to move them.* - Fri Oct 30 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Well I tell you what go ahead and lay back. - Fri Oct 30 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I can tale your still hard. - Fri Oct 30 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her, he'd painfully try to roll over, laying onto his back, "I-I think I L-" though, keeping himself quiet, he knew that wasn't something he should say unless he new it was the right time.* - Fri Oct 30 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) not expecting what was to come, he'd feel her grab ahold of him, and then go onto start licking various parts. Though, unable to hand anything to bite onto, he'd start to let out the sounds he had been making before, now at full volume since he couldn't muffle them. Also, being that he had already came twice, he'd be extremely sensitive.* - Fri Oct 30 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) hearing her question, he'd be unable to answer as he was too busy moaning out a bit, though feeling her mouth and tongue go over him, causing him to grab the sheets, grasping them tightly. Feeling her tongue going around it he'd say, "T-To G-Good." before his head fell back into the pillow, his breathing a bit ragid.* - Fri Oct 30 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Having been really sensitive already, he'd suddenly feel more of him in her mouth, and her tongue going over more of it. Then, feeling her hands on his sack, he'd moan even loader, "Hanae I-I don't know how much longer I ca-n." saying such, his rod would begin to grow a bit again, and pulse a bit, it obvious that even though it hadn't been long, he didn't have much time left before he blew again.* - Fri Oct 30 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her hand on him, he'd moan again, the feeling she was giving him, a bit too much for him. "H-Hanae I t-think I-" though, as he was about to say something he knew he shouldn't again, he'd find himself cut short as his lower half jerked a but, shooting his load once more, likely covering parts of Hanae, and her hand. 

Once doing this, he'd be motionless on the bed, the only movement shown would be the ragid breathes he had, and the up and down of his small body as he breathed.* - Fri Oct 30 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her continue to rub him as he came, he'd be even more sensitive, "U-Uh." still hard, but a little too out of it right now. "S-So much. . .pleasure." saying such as he was a bit broke after three times.* - Fri Oct 30 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling himself getting licked, he'd stir a small about, "H-Hanae. . ." coming back to his senses, he'd look down, feeling another lick, he'd moan out, "I-I wanna make you feel good too. . " though as he said this, his chest would raise and lower faster, as his small weak body was sweating profusely, which, in a long run, probably wouldn't be good.* - Fri Oct 30 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her move on top of him again, he'd feel himself slide all the way into her. Letting himself moan again he'd force his arms up, trying to put them around Hanae, but having a hard time, he'd only got one hand up and around her, lost in his lust a bit, not realizing how much his body was getting punished, "H-Hanae, I love you." 

Saying such, he'd try to use his one arm to pull her in, his breathing a bit shallow.* - Fri Oct 30 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) again moving his arms up around her, he'd try to pull himself towards her, locking lips and attempting to push his tongue in hesitantly. Feeling her hips start to move slowly, he'd moan into her mouth, losing his mind, along with the well being of his body.

"I-I don't know if I can take much more after this. ." pausing he'd say, "M-My body hurts." saying such as he'd put in more work here than he had in a long time.* - Fri Oct 30 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her speed up, he'd again start to moan out quite loudly, his face taking the form of a girly lustful face. Leaning forward again, he'd try to move to Hanae's neck to bite in, he needed something to stop him from being embarrassed.

"I-I just want you to feel good." saying such, he'd try his best to thrust back, his body screaming a bit from going onto the fourth time without any substantial break.* - Fri Oct 30 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her playing with his hair, he'd bite harder into her, feeling her tighten up, and the liquid coating him. Though, when it tightened, cobined with how sensitive he was, he'd again explode into her, coating the inside of her. "H-Hanae~" 

Saying such, he'd fall back, literally unable to move, -needing- the break of else his body would probably actually break.* - Fri Oct 30 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her he'd blush heavily, still having a hard time breathing, he'd say, "C-Can I ask you to do something for me?" blushing while trying to look away, but too sore to do such.* - Fri Oct 30 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: What is it? - Fri Oct 30 02:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Sure. - Fri Oct 30 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Being moved, he'd be pulled against Hanae, closing his eyes to rest, having his back and head rubbed, letting out cute little noises every now and again, "W-Won't the others be wondering where you are?" though, he didn't care, he was happy.* - Fri Oct 30 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Nah. - Fri Oct 30 02:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Saying such, he'd un-summon his Koala, forcing himself to his feet, and painfully walking over to Hanae, trying to hug her, but simply falling into her lap, "I-I guess not that much better."* - Fri Oct 30 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Having Hanae's arms wrap around him he'd say, "I-I just didn't want you so far away. . ." saying such he'd snuggle into her, obviously wanting to be close.* - Fri Oct 30 04:23:15 2015

Curling himself up a bit, he'd say, "I love you. . ." saying such he'd look away from her, blushing.* - Fri Oct 30 04:26:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) looking at her a bit confused he'd say, "N-No. . .I'm not usually that hungry, but I can try it." saying such, he'd rub his stomach, being basically nothing there.* - Fri Oct 30 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her blushing he'd look away, "I-I don't know. . .my mouth kinda hurts too. . .I'm not sure I can do it alone." he was -obviously- teasing this time.

Pausing to let the joke set in, once she'd acknowledge it, he'd go to take a small bite, testing it.* - Fri Oct 30 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Chewing what he had, and actually founding he'd enjoy it, he'd swallow, looking to her fondly, "W-well I am still hungry." saying such, he'd blush and look away, unsure of what to do.* - Fri Oct 30 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Oh. - Fri Oct 30 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Watching as she took a bite, he'd feel her turn his head, and then forcing the food into his mouth with her tongue. Chewing it and swallowing it, he'd try to keep the kiss going, sticking his tongue into her mouth. 

Breaking it though after a small bit of time, he'd lay back onto the bed, "Moving still hurts. . .what we did was amazing, but it hurts so bad. . ."* - Fri Oct 30 04:56:32 2015
