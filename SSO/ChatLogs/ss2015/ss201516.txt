He was obviously trying to talk her into what she had to let out. In terms, he was trying to repay her for everything she had done for him.* - Wed Nov 18 08:16:38 2015

I just figured it'd be easier if it was like having a normal conversation." though, rubbing his neck, he'd lean back into the couch tiredly, it would seem that he hadn't slept in some time.* - Wed Nov 18 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Rubbing his eyes and his nose for a moment, both to keep himself awake, and to think, he'd slowly nod, "Groomsmen I believe. Though I could be wrong." saying such, he'd smirk a bit, "Looking forward to it?"* - Wed Nov 18 08:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Sighing slightly he'd aim to rush forward. Trying to close the distance slightly, he' try and test the waters, aiming a punch experimentally at her gut. At the same time he'd make note of any defence she'd try to put up, or any counter attacks. Regardless if the attack got through or not, he'd back off afterwards, checking to see what she'd do.* - Sat Nov 21 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: mmm... - Sat Nov 21 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being pushed back, he'd shake his head slightly, "Oh? I see. Well then, you have my interest, but let's see if you can keep it." saying such, he'd again move back in, for what would appear to be the same exact thing he had done before, though this time around he'd be hiding a great deal more hitting power behind hid punch, aiming again to hit her in the gut, and if she went to grab his hand again, he'd likely attempt to continue the punch and knock her back.

"Let's see if you are serious or not." * - Sat Nov 21 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh.. - Sat Nov 21 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Alright.. - Sat Nov 21 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) being that he saw the punch coming, but lacked the ability to fully dodge, he'd turn his head slightly, letting himself get punched in the face, though avoiding his nose. Though even though he was hit in the face, if anything it would feel as though she had hit a solid break wall with the amount of force she was putting in. Standing back to his feet, he'd look towards Yan now, ignoring Kinami he'd say, "Here is what I wanted to show off."

Suddenly having a mark appear over his right arm, and move up to cover half of his face, causing an eye to change color and his teeth to sharpen, he'd hold himself to his first form, finally having somplete control over -this- form. "See Yan. I managed to gain control of it." saying such, he'd simply glare to Kinami, "I suggest you take -me- seriously now."* - Sat Nov 21 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Big pappy) thinks: I wouldn't ever let either of them get close to me. I'd put  them to sleep before hand... - Sat Nov 21 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being that he wasn't paying much attention to Kinami, he'd basically tank the hits, simply shaking them off as annoyances. Though, once she was done he'd say, "I assume it's my turn?" having said such, he'd suddenly attempt to rush her, aiming to again, hit her in the gut. This if sucessful, would lead to him aiming to kick her legs out from under her.

Mumbling while he did such, "No need to even use my techniques yet." as he did such, he'd wait to see the outcome of his attacks if they landed, being that if she had avoided, he'f figure he'd have to step it up a notch.* - Sat Nov 21 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright..uhm.. - Sat Nov 21 02:57:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being that his attacks had missed once again, he'd sigh slightly. Though, suddenly taking a kick to the jaw, he'd be raised slightly, yet unhurt. Then, taking the barrage of hits that would likely send him higher into the air, he'd let a small chuckle out.

Suspended there slightly as Kinami had kicked off, he'd quickly stretch his arm out, sending it after her as she made her way to the ground. It was likely that it would catch her unaware, and wrap around her tightly, making it so that she couldn't do anything else as he fell. If this was sucessful, he'd of course keep his grip on her well after he fell back to the ground and managed to get to his feet.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being hit with a barrage of attacks, he wouldn't exactly feel much from any of it. Though, as he was thrown to the ground, the arm he had outstretched would have come back in an attempt to wrap around around her, nto stopping even with the attacks he was recieving.

Regardless if the arm managed to wrap around her, he'd be kicked into the ground, the most happening to him, being that the ground was sand, and his body was tough enough to take her hits anyway, would be a bit of marking on his stomach under his clothes, and having a bit of air knocked out of him.

If the arm had managed to get her this time, he'd stand, looking to her. The same if it didn't, spitting a bit of saliva out that sand in it from hitting the ground he'd stare the girl down, "So that was it huh?" it was obvious Aza wanted a bit of payback, even if he had to run her down until she was out of energy.* - Sat Nov 21 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having wrapped her up, he'd shake his head, "While I do have the urge to still hit you for the annoyance you caused me, I won't. I don't feel like having Yan on my back, or having to take you to the hospital." having said such, he'd set her down lightly. 

Sighing a small bit, he'd reign himself in, withdrawing all of the energy he had let out in order to be in the first form of his curse.* - Sat Nov 21 03:42:17 2015
