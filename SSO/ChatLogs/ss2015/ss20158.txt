<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Anger coursing through him, he'd clinch his fist. Hearing her say that he had no self control, would basically be adding fuel to the fire. She was basically saying he was a monster, she was admiting to it. Shaking his head he'd grit his teeth. He wouldn't say anything, but the usual mark would begin to form over part of his body. Not even remembering it was part of a treatment anymore, it would take him over rather easily.

Roaring out in a rather monsterous sound, he'd slame a now, brown, deformed fist into the wall, likely going through it. Then, turning to stare Nari down, he'd screech. For some odd reason he wouldn't advance on her, though, he would start to look towards the exit already.

Though, being that his hand was still through a wall, he'd have to manage with getting it out.* - Wed Nov 11 09:44:57 2015

His right hand gripping one of the metal hand bars, would squeeze down, starting to dent the metal of the chair. "I'm sick of everyone calling me dangerous. It may be true in a sense, but I don't want to hear it." upon saying such, he'd begin to take deep breathes. 

Doing probably the best he had ever done to withhold his anger he would say, "I suggest you let me take Kiyoko where she wants to go. . .before I lose it. I don't plan to leave without her."* - Thu Nov 12 02:12:16 2015

"I-I Suggest you all shut up and give me a second." he was quite literally fighting himself now. It was unsure who was winning, but was was sure, is that someone was going to have to replace Kiyoko's wheelchair, as he had now fully crushed one of the handles on the chair, causing his hand to be cut by the crumpled metal. Blood running down his right hand, he'd look to Bryson, anger shown in his eyes, "W-What did you call me?" 

Having asked such, though he wished for the man not to reply, and for everyone to shut up at this point, he'd close his eyes, trying to calm himself down. It was looking like some struggle between the hulk and Bruce Banner going on. "J-Just everyoen be quiet and give me a second.

As he said this, if everyone remained quiet and calm, it'd be likely he'd be able to gain a hold of himself, and eventually calm a bit. Though, if the same types of things that had been said continued, who knew what would happen.* - Thu Nov 12 02:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm... - Thu Nov 12 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So you can't think of anything funny right now? - Thu Nov 12 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Not really. - Thu Nov 12 04:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Hm? - Thu Nov 12 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Simply shaking his head at her poor attempt to joke, he'd shake his head. "At least you can laugh about it." pausing, looking away from her he'd say, "I guess being the one who caused it, I don't find it that funny." saying such, he'd rub his neck a bit.* - Thu Nov 12 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly at her he'd say, "You're ridiculous. Too chill about things." having said such, he'd shrug some, leaning back with his head tilted up against the wall. "Too many people is bad for me. . .for obvious reasons." saying such, he'd hum a bit to himself, trying to relax now, and keep himself from feeling awkward over being with the girl he had almost killed.* - Thu Nov 12 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head again he'd say, "Not a clue. Like I said, just looked like a light show to me." upon saying such, he'd continue to hum, trying to remember something from his childhood, but having a hard time recailing hte tune. "Well, feeling better to leave yet? I assume you don't want to be stuck in here."* - Thu Nov 12 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I could stay here forever, why do I like that weird smell so much. - Thu Nov 12 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head a bit he'd say, "I'm unsure of a spa, though I'd just be dropping you off at one anyway, I'm not sure I'd like it, or if it would be appropriate." saying such he'd simply say, "Though, you are the hurt one. You can do as you please, stay or go. I simply don't want that man bothering you."* - Thu Nov 12 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Hospitals are only bad memories. - Thu Nov 12 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head a bit, "She wouldn't be mad, she simply is curious why only girls are trying to help me." saying such he'd sigh again, looking to her now, "We can go to the spa if you really want, I don't care." though leaning his head back again, humming once more, "We can do whatever, and, I don't eat often." though he wouldn't say the truth, being that he had hadn't eatten since he had attacked her, and since he had thrown up.* - Thu Nov 12 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . .What? - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: It's not that. - Thu Nov 12 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Simply, along with you, Marrisa and a few other girls keep trying to help me. - Thu Nov 12 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: She is worried, for nothing I might add. - Thu Nov 12 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Kinda rude though, make me feel like I'm not worth anyone being interested in me. - Thu Nov 12 05:19:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: At least to ease her worry? - Thu Nov 12 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Hm? - Thu Nov 12 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm pansexual, do you know what that means? - Thu Nov 12 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sanoke didn't. - Thu Nov 12 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Not really. - Thu Nov 12 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Pansexual is when you find a person's personality attractive. It doesn't matter what they look like, pretty, ugly, stunny, scarred, small, big, male, female. - Thu Nov 12 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The more you know their personality the more attractive they become. - Thu Nov 12 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well, to me at least. - Thu Nov 12 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I see. - Thu Nov 12 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I do find you attractive because I know you have an amazing personality deep down that you keep hiding away from the world. - Thu Nov 12 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But I also labeled you as taken, which puts you off limits. - Thu Nov 12 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov 12 05:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Benefits of the sexuality? - Thu Nov 12 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I've never had a temptation to force anyone out of relationship. - Thu Nov 12 05:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Raising an eyebrow at Kiyoko he'd say, "What is it?"* - Thu Nov 12 05:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Though it causes more pain than anything. - Thu Nov 12 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I'm afraid I'll hurt her one day. - Thu Nov 12 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I uh... is she the first person you've loved? - Thu Nov 12 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Obviously had no issues talking about things like this, out of anything in the world there was to talk about.* - Thu Nov 12 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: She isn't the first person I thought I loved. But I'm sure she is the first person I -know- I love. Even if she can be aggravating. - Thu Nov 12 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh. - Thu Nov 12 05:35:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: If you don't want to talk about it, don't. - Thu Nov 12 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't really know how to say it. - Thu Nov 12 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't know how to say it. - Thu Nov 12 05:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...yeah. - Thu Nov 12 05:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Let's go get some food. - Thu Nov 12 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: No problem. . .Nari is asleep anyway. . and she is going to be busy for awhile. . .I need to try and relax while she is busy. - Thu Nov 12 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mkay. - Thu Nov 12 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Lets go.~ - Thu Nov 12 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: A-Are there any more wheel chairs? - Thu Nov 12 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh yeah, just go out and ask the head nurse. - Thu Nov 12 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She will give you one in my name. Just tell her that I'm covering the loss of the other. - Thu Nov 12 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Nodding a bit, he'd move out and into the hall to look for said person. Once he had explained it all and come back, he'd say, "They'll have one down the stairs for you." saying such he'd then make as to carry her again, "You don't mind right?" 

If he was allowed, he'd of course carefully pick her up, and carry her down the stairs, aiming to put her in it and wheel her to the next destination.* - Thu Nov 12 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having gotten her into the chair he'd say, "Where to?" of course then taking her to where ever she said.* - Thu Nov 12 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The Hungry Ant. - Thu Nov 12 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Wheeling her into the building, he'd set her to the side, so she could stay in the chair, "What do you want? I can treat you. . ."* - Thu Nov 12 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head at her happiness, he'd look to the menu, unsure of what to get. Sighing some, leaning back into the chair, he'd think things over. "Order for me too will you?" though in reality, he wasn't that hungry, and was unsure if he'd even eat. Again, leaning back against the wall he'd start to hum. It was a new method of keeping himself calm that he had come up with, and it seemed to distract him as well.* - Thu Nov 12 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Just pick something, stop being silly. - Thu Nov 12 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: If you say so. - Thu Nov 12 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov 12 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: You're out of it. - Thu Nov 12 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I don't know what to think. - Thu Nov 12 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...so even if I'm out of it I can't earn more trust? - Thu Nov 12 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I'm not sure if you're acting truthfully as you are. As the lightbulb saild, you're under the influence of a head injury~ - Thu Nov 12 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Who knows. - Thu Nov 12 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov 12 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd look to his food, not moving to touch it, not exactly hungry at the moment, "You still plan to keep trying?" asking such, he'd raise an eyebrow at her, "I'm not sure if that's smart." saying such, he'd again lean back, pulling his hood over his head, a very tired look on his face as he began to hum once more. For only being seven-teen, he'd have a very tired, worn out look on his face.* - Thu Nov 12 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Sighing slightly, barely catching what she had said, he'd whisper back, "Why?" Pulling the hood a bit tighter down around his face, he'd sigh. Though, then changing the subject he'd say, "I need music. . .I bet that'd help. . .just block everyone out. . "* - Thu Nov 12 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly, he'd continue to hum, "You can have it." saying such, he'd chuckle slightly, remembering something from his past. "Are you really my friend?"* - Thu Nov 12 07:27:08 2015
