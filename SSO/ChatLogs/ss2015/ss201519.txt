<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Would simply wait for the waiter, "I'll have what she yelled for." saying such, he'd rub his neck a bit, yawning. His body was mostly hidden by the hoodie aside from his face. Though, even there scars could be seen, and would also be hidden all over him under his clothes. 

Looking up to Rias, his eyes would be a bit blank, as if he didn't exactly care about how happy the girl was. "Nothing to tell." saying such as if it was fact, he'd lean back in the chair, his hands going to his hoodie pockets at he waited for his drink.* - Wed Nov 25 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Oh comon! Everyone has something to tell, a little bit of you has to be intersting. Or, do you like to stay cool and mysterious! Hahaha! - Wed Nov 25 06:01:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to Chik, he'd raise an eyebrow, he thought it was common knowledge by now of what he was. Though, if she didn't know, he wasn't going to say. Shrugging a bit, he'd stay quiet for now.* - Wed Nov 25 06:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) sighing slightly looking between them all, he still wouldn't speak right away, just nodding to each one. Though when he got to Chik and her burst of words, he'd shrug, thinking to himself, <Doubt it.> before moving back to lean on the wall. 

Once his tea had finally shown up, he'd sip on it slowly, not really one to speak unless a specific question was asked, and perhaps even then he'd have to think about if he wanted to respond. He had to keep a lock on his emotions and such, being his past and his outburst. Thus, the outcome would be what was seen in him now.* - Wed Nov 25 06:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hahah, you're a real quiet guy. - Wed Nov 25 06:21:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Perhaps because I consider her family? - Wed Nov 25 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: So tell us about you... - Wed Nov 25 06:22:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) His eyes flaring with life a small bit, they'd eventually fall back to the blank look they had originally. Shaking his head slightly again, now pulling the hood on his jacket up over his head, finding it more comfortable to lean against the wall if his head had some padding. 

"I'm from. . .a distant place." not wanting to get into where he originally hailed from, "I came here at a young age." pausing, looking at her for a moment before looking to his tea he'd say, "I have no family, and I won't talk about them past saying such." his family being a touchy subject, he'd try to put that particular question to rest now.* - Wed Nov 25 06:30:24 2015

Moving onto Hiro he'd simply state, "She started a nasty rumor about me that the -Kaze- had to dismiss, and we won't be talking about it." Keeping an apathetic voice as he spoke, as if he didn't actually care.* - Wed Nov 25 06:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Catching sight of everything that had happened, he'd have a bit of life flare back to his eyes, and his face would blush for about a second before it all faded back to how it normally looked. Though, as he heard her last question, and saw the way she looked at him, he'd know.

It wasn't the first time someone had tried to figure out his ability, and it wouldn't be the last. He had been tested on and the such, and he wasn't going to allow it anymore. Thus, his face hardening even more so, where his life had simply been blank before, now it was actual discust. "No."* - Wed Nov 25 07:00:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head, doing his best to ignore the girl in front of him. He didn't need this at this time, so thus, he'd lean back against the wall, closing his eyes before speaking aloud to Chik and Hiro, "Is she always this way towards people? Because if she acts that way towards any old person, it's really trashy." saying such, he'd grab his tea once more, taking a sip.

Once he had, he'd of course lean back agains the way, doing his best to keep his composure, though, he wouldn't exactly have to try hard being that his emotions had hardened a long time ago. "You really shouldn't act that way, people might think weirdly of you." saying such now, he'd sigh slightly.

"It was nice having tea with you, but seems one of your friends is here, thus, I'll be on my way." saying such, his cold face staying how it was as he rose from his seat.* - Wed Nov 25 07:30:59 2015

She was one of the only medics in the area, thus, he'd again hold back on his urge to rush in and stay by her side.

His body releasing the energy he had constantly been storing, he'd start to change over to his first stage.* - Wed Nov 25 20:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Catching sight of Trill engaged with an Edge, he'd know that they were still being attacked to the East, thus, catching sight of Ryomen he'd say, "Come with me!" before attempting to grab his atm and run to the far east, knowing Trill could likely handle himself.* - Wed Nov 25 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having grabbed a hold of Ryomen and brought him to the east, he'd eventually let go of him, and be standing there in his partial changed transformed state. Looking to Ryomen he'd simply mutter, "Aza, unsure how much help I'll be, but I can at least be a distraction." saying such he'd huff a bit, sick of all the recent fighting.* - Wed Nov 25 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) whispers: We're fucked, j/s xD.) - Wed Nov 25 20:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: I am from Kumogakure. - Wed Nov 25 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being suddenly caught in a genjutsu, being that his tansformation was already making him a bti stupid to begin with, he'd find himself starting to drift a bit, though at the same time, his control slipping over his tranformation, even as he started to fall to the ground. 

Though, as the state progressed it would take him over, his chakra would blare with nature chakra. While it would  cause him to lose his mind, and turn into a literal monster, it would allow him to escape from the effects of the genjutsu. 

His body starting to change even more, the brown color would suddenly over take his body, changing it and morphing it into a monsterous form. His other eye and face changing as well. His teeth sharpening, and his back starting to form tubes that would look somewhat like exaust pipes. Though, again with this transformation, he'd lose control of himself. His eyes having been locked on Rymei's form to begin with, his monsterous rage would be released on her to start.

His hand and elbow changing shape, it would take on the form of a piston at the elboe. Dashing foreward, he'd attempt to swing it into her, aiming dead for her chest.* - Wed Nov 25 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: So if I moved out of the field - Wed Nov 25 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having his attacked dodged, he'd look to her with monsterous yellow eyes. Registering what he could inside his animalistic brain, he'd basically ignore the sword that would have gone through his gut, like it wasn't even there. Though, this of course would't mean it didn't damage him, as blood would start to pour out of the opening. Though, during this entire process -as- she was stabbing him, his other arm would quickly extend forward, aiming to wrap around her while she was busy worrying about what to do.

If he was fast enough, this technique would kick off as the blade entered ito her, hoping to take advantage of her distraction towards Ryo. Hoping if anything to stop her movements, he'd also attempt to lift her with it, tossing her behind himself.

If he couldn't stop her from grabbing him, he'd still let his arm extend, aiming to wrap around her, and stop himself from being flung but so far in Ryo's direction. Though, in all honesty, it was more of an animalistic urge to kill the girl in front of him.* - Wed Nov 25 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Where did Ryo go? - Wed Nov 25 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: -omit- - Wed Nov 25 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being that by the time she had stopped, his arm would have already unwrapped itself, his body unable to keep up with the strain of being dragged around, it would retract back to his body as he started to revert back to his stage one trans, his body unable to take the strain of maintaining the monster.

Once he had reverted back to his first stage, the blade still through his stomach, he'd fight to stand to his feet. His one human looking eye a bit hazy now, he'd look about, struggling to see any right answer as of what to do. Being that he had a blade through his gut he'd have a hard time at it, but he would move forward, leaving it impaled in him, figuring that if he removed it, it would only lead to more damage.

Reaching back with his now left, human arm, he'd grab a pouch. Doing such while the girl seemed to be distracted by Ryo, he'd toss it to land behind her feet, grunting in pain as he went to make a seal.* - Wed Nov 25 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being that he had suddenly heard a noise behind him as someone spoke out towards him, his half monsterous face would glance back for about a a second, still thinking that he would be able to save the person he had foolishly dragged into a fight that he was unsure he'd be able to handle. Though, being that he'd suddenly have a chakra rod stabbed through his throat, he'd gasp for a second.

In this second, that seemed to last an enternity, all of his thoughts would flash through his head. First being the memory of the parents he had accidently killed in a rage, then it would be followed by the memory of his lost love Nari, who he had forcefully taken down when she threatened to leave him, and tried to kill him. Though, these thoughts would be chased off when he suddenly came to the realization of the people he would be leaving behind, the last person he had that was likely family to him, Kiyoko, who he hoped Akira would be watching after.

This being close to one of the last thoughts on his mind, he'd also realize that Edge would likely storm the village and eventually kill her as well, which wouldn't sit right with him. Grunting out, he'd attempt to say, "Leave us alone." though it would likely come out in a gargled mess as he had the weapon in his wind pipe. This last sad attempt at language would be likely the last thing anyone saw or heard of him as his mind wandered one last time.

<I won't get to see Kiyoko get married. . . > being that for the past month, he had been focused on surviving long enough for the person he considered a mom to get married. This though would be on his mind as his body finally went limp, and life left his body, the transformation cauased by his body's chakra intake ending.* - Thu Nov 26 00:08:32 2015
