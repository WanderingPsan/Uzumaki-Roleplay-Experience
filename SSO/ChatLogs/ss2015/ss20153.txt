<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Being carried down the steps, the first thing that hit him would be the smell, causing him to almost gag. Doing his best to ignore it, along with the bones and Stains, he'd wrap his arms around Hanae, very tightly. He had asked for this, and he had no choice but to go along with it as, he had already made the mistake of going back on his word once.

"H-Hanae. . .c-can't we only stay long enough for me to see?" already frightened. As to reinforce this, his fingers would dig into her quite hard.* - Mon Nov  2 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Seeing the scene in front of him he'd say, "W-Why do that to him?" being that he didn't exactly care if Hanae had done it, just more of, why the man would let it happen.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) hearing what she said he'd look to her, worried, "H-Hanae. . .please?" though as he said this he'd feel something suddenly, frightening him even more.

"I-I want to have fun at home. . ." saying such he'd wiggle a bit, trying to get free, "L-Let go Hanae. . .you're scaring me."* - Mon Nov  2 20:16:00 2015

Hearing what Hanae was saying, he'd freeze up even more, "Y-You said you wouldn't hurt me t-that badily anymore." saying such, he'd lock down, a death grip on his own body, holding himself in a ball.

Thinking aloud he'd say, "I-I knew I'd only be hurt again."  refering to mentally, not physically now.* - Mon Nov  2 21:14:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Having heard her, he'd think she was having a naughty dream. Thus, turning to look at her, he'd listen a bit, his hand going to the top of his pants to rub himself a bit without being obvious.* - Mon Nov  2 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her call his name again, and watching her move, he'd try to move a bit closer, wanting to touch her, but not wanting to risk waking her and having her made, he wasn't that lustful - yet. Though, he would bite his own lip a bit, slowly removing his own pants, throwing them to the side, and slowly started to rub himself. His face twisting with a small bit of lust for her.* - Mon Nov  2 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Watching as her butt was moved back towards him, he'd struggle, his moral compass going off. A bit out of his mind he'd whisper, "I-I'm sorry Hanae." before moving forward and wrapping his arms around her, starting to rub his member into her butt a bit, trying to pleasure himself, "I-I'm too perverted now. . .I didn't want to be this way."* - Mon Nov  2 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Panicing a bit, he'd tuck himself back into his boxers, trying to pretend he didn't know what she was talking about, "W-What do you mean?" saying such, he'd blush pure red, almost breaking down and telling her the truth.* - Mon Nov  2 23:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) thinks: I-I don't want her mad at me. .  - Tue Nov  3 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Watching as her butt was again pressed out, he'd lick his lips a bit, unsure if he should continue, though, breaking down, he'd again let his member out of his boxers, moving forward to try and rub it against her, his breathing getting a bit ragid.* - Tue Nov  3 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her, proding a bit more, rubbing it at a decent speed, he'd moan a bit, though, biting his lips he'd mumble, "Hanae. . .if you don't wake up I might go too far." saying such he'd look to her boxers, knowing what was under them. Lighting wrapping his arms around her, his hands would go to rest on her chest, almost tempted to play with her nipples.* - Tue Nov  3 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Seemingly that she was fully passed out he'd mumble, "I-I'm sorry Hanae." saying such, he'd try to pull her boxers down a bit to where he could get to her. Then, using the hand on her chest, he'd rub one of her nipple slightly. 
Taking his member between her legs, he'd rub it against her, refusing to put it in because he knew that he would be taking to far if he did that. Though, he would lean in and kiss her neck a bit.* - Tue Nov  3 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling bad, but also over powered by lust, he'd stop playing with her nipple, and line himself up with her folds, he couldnt' help himself anymore. Attempting to slowly put it in.* - Tue Nov  3 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Panicing, he'd finally break down, "I-I'm sorry Hanae. . .I-I've turned into a pervert.  .I-I tried to. ." breaking off, he'd cling to her back.* - Tue Nov  3 00:34:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) having her lean back, and slide onto him, he'd moan. Barely getting out he'd say, "B-But I-"  still feeling guilty for what he tried to do, but the feeling of her made him lose all words.* - Tue Nov  3 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her now remove herself, he'd grit his teeth. "I-I'm going to the bathroom." saying such he'd attempt to get out of the bed.* - Tue Nov  3 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Okay take your time. - Tue Nov  3 00:47:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Having stopped once he had heard her, he'd see her leaning over the bed, "I'm sorry." saying such, he'd quickly move forward, grabbing onto her hips and sliding himself into her, "I-I can't help myself." saying such, he'd attempt to move in and out of her, only thinking selfishly of himself for once.

"I-I'm sorry."* - Tue Nov  3 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Continuing to thrust in and out, he'd moan a bit, much like a school girl, "T-Then I guess I'm breaking and entering." gripping tightly onto her hips, he'd be a bit lost in lust, "I-I feel broken. . ." refering to the way his lust was.* - Tue Nov  3 00:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) having said such, he'd suddenly come to his realization of exactly what he was doing. Pulling out he'd sit back on his legs, huffinf a bit, "I-I'm sorry I-I'll punish myself now." saying such he'd look around for the knife they had out before, "D-Do you have that knife?" thinking the only way to make up for it was to hurt himself.* - Tue Nov  3 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) seeing her fall, he'd panic, "A-Are you ok?" saying such, he'd move off the bed to look to where she had gone. "A-And c-could you hit me? I-I need to punish myself."* - Tue Nov  3 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I have your punishment ready down here. - Tue Nov  3 01:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: W-What? - Tue Nov  3 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Gulping, nodding, as he did do something wrong, he would lay over the bed, "P-Please be easy with me." saying such, he'd clench his eyes closed, already scared.* - Tue Nov  3 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her spit come onto his hole, he'd say, "P-Please don't make me like weird things." though, he didn't have much time to complain as it started to slide into him. Grunting a bit, he'd tense up. "S-Stop."

Feeling it slide all the way into him, he'd tear up, starting to cry some. Though, feeling her hit the button, and the vibration, he'd clench his eyes closed, and his hands, moaning just a small bit, though over all he disliked it more than it pleasured him at the moment. "W-Weird."* - Tue Nov  3 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Clenching his fist, tears still coming out of his eyes, his mouth would hang open, a mixture of pain and pleasure coming out in noise. "S-Stop! T-This si worse than what I did to you." saying such, his upper half would fail, and he'd fall onto the bed, his lower half at Hanae's mercy.* - Tue Nov  3 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling it, it would be an equal amount of pain and pleasure, he didn't like having it in him, but something about Hanae being the one doing it made him feel like it was alright, "I-I don't. G-Get it out." saying such, he'd have tears running down his face, "I-I'm sorry for what I did!"* - Tue Nov  3 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Moving up, he'd let the toy fall to the floor, still vibrating. Moving to the corner of the room, he'd curl up in a ball, having his legs in his arms, and wiping his eyes, "I-I-" trailing off as he put his head to his legs again.* - Tue Nov  3 01:42:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her as she started to read, he'd move to the bed, laying on his back, his bones popping a bit, stretching out fully.* - Wed Nov  4 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I love you Hanae. - Wed Nov  4 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) saying such, he'd curl up, moving to look at her like a happy little kid.* - Wed Nov  4 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) thinks: D-Did she not want to say it back? Or have I said it too much. . . - Wed Nov  4 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her, he'd move to stand up. "I'm going to let you have some alone time for once." saying such, he'd look himself over, making sure he was fit enough to go outside without anything happening.* - Wed Nov  4 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: W-why? - Wed Nov  4 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: ... - Wed Nov  4 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Did I do something wrong? - Wed Nov  4 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: N-No. . . - Wed Nov  4 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I just don't want you to get bored of me. . . - Wed Nov  4 00:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: D-dont leave me! - Wed Nov  4 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I'm sorry... - Wed Nov  4 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Seeing her start to get worried, he'd in turn start to worry, his own breathing picking up, "W-What's wrong Hanae??" saying such he'd have quite a sad look on his face, "I-I just didn't want you to get sick of me. . .I-I thought being around was making you sick of me already." saying such, he'd slightly wrap his arms around himself, hugging himself.* - Wed Nov  4 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Seeing her eyes start to water, he'd crawl over the bed, accidently falling of the side into the floor. Hurting himself slightly, he'd sit up to look at her, half of him taking this as her making fun of him and making him a bit angry, while the other half was legitimately worried. 

Bringing his knees to his chest, holding himself with his own eyes starting to flood, and his breathing probably rocketing up as well, "W-Why would I want to leave you? Y-You're. . .the only thing I have left." though he wasn't counting his summon, as Koko really had no choice but to come when he called her. Anyway, saying such, he'd burry his head into his knees, "A-are you making fun of me?"* - Wed Nov  4 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Watching her move to sit in the floor, hearing up, he'd just look to her, tears in his eyes still. Feeling his arms wrap around him, he'd bury his face into her.

Though, hearing her say it again, and her squeeze him tighter, tears would stream a bit faster for a moment, as it was slightly painful, but he wasn't going to say such. "S-Still not fair. . .I-I don't have a nickname for you." saying such, he'd sob a bit into her.* - Wed Nov  4 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Hmm. - Wed Nov  4 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Maybe you can call me Queen. - Wed Nov  4 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Queen bug... - Wed Nov  4 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: ...Doesn't sound right.. - Wed Nov  4 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I sorta have one more fitting. . . - Wed Nov  4 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Moving his head back to look at her, wiping the tears away, "I-I could always call you Honey-Bun. . ." smiling in a small way, he was obviously making a joke being that was all he'd seen her hit.* - Wed Nov  4 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Awh.. - Wed Nov  4 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: My cuddle bug so sweet. - Wed Nov  4 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: . . . - Wed Nov  4 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Simply tucking his head back into her he'd say, "I'll never leave you. . .honeybun." saying such he'd close his eyes.* - Wed Nov  4 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I know you wont. - Wed Nov  4 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: if you try I'll kill you. - Wed Nov  4 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Remy. - Wed Nov  4 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) his arms, wrapped around Hanae, would go a bit weak. Being a bit more pale than usual, this bit of panic put him over the edge. Closing his eyes, he'd stay against her, though, not much movement would come from him, or sound.* - Wed Nov  4 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Are you feeling okay? - Wed Nov  4 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: Y-Yea. . .of course. - Wed Nov  4 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) thinks: I can't let her know I don't feel well. - Wed Nov  4 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: . . . - Wed Nov  4 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Okay. - Wed Nov  4 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Do you want play with my body? - Wed Nov  4 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) trying to pull away from her, starting to sweat a bit he'd say, "A-Ah, I'm gonna use the bathroom." saying such, he'd walk towards it, almost stumbling, "I-I don't know. . L-Let me- " saying such, he'd almost fall. "I-I just need a shower."* - Wed Nov  4 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Okay. - Wed Nov  4 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Take you time in there~ - Wed Nov  4 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: -chuckles- - Wed Nov  4 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) once inside of the bathroom, he'd close the door, getting undressed. Though, moving to turn the shower on, he'd step in. His breathing being a bit ragid, and his face red. After a few moments, he'd lean into the wall, his body being weaker than normal. Suddenly falling in the shower, it's be likely that Hanae would hear him hit the bottom, as he laid there, having the breathe knocked out of him and his body a bit too weak to move.* - Wed Nov  4 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) being picked up, he'd simply give a slight chuckle, "I-I'm not feeling well. . .M-Maybe I haven't eatten enough after all." saying such, he'd be somewhat limp in her arms. "I-I'm sorry for you having to come check on me . .now your clothes are wet. . I-I'll wash them." saying such, he'd shaking his head, he'd try to stand up, though, not getting anywhere.* - Wed Nov  4 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Relax. - Wed Nov  4 01:23:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) saying such, he'd struggle to get to his knees, grabbing on to anything he could to get to a standing position.* - Wed Nov  4 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) getting helped up, and having the towel wrapped around him, and her hand rubbing against him, he'd almost fall again, as his bodily functions almost switched over from preservation, to well, ya know. 

"Y-You'll cook for me? Y-You don't have to do that. . .I-I'm not that bad where I can't cook for us. . .no need to work yourself."* - Wed Nov  4 01:28:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Being pushed back, and he towel being undone, he'd say, "W-What happened to eatting. . .? T-Though this isn't bad." being that his body had basically switched over now, letting his body be weak and helpless to let blood rush to his member, he'd harden up at her licks causing him to moan out like a girl.* - Wed Nov  4 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her lick all over him, going painfully slow as she did it, he'd continue to moan, having no control over it. Though, feeling his legs being spread, he'd look down somewhat confused before seeing her lay. Suddenly feeling her tongue on his balls, he'd bite his bottom lip, hard enough to draw blood, noises that didn't make much sense coming out of his mouth. "S-So good." though he wouldn't exactly be able to move to grab her like he wanted, his body too weak.* - Wed Nov  4 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) hearing her, he'd look at her a bit with puppy dog eyes, though, he wouldn't be able to for very long as his head slammed back, mouth wide open moaning from having himself inside of her mouth, feeling her tongue work its magic. "H-Hanae. . .I-I don't think I can. . . much longer." getting this out between moans, he'd start to pulse a bit, a sign that he was sure to cum soon.* - Wed Nov  4 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her take him in more, and further back into her throat, he'd be unable to control himself, "H-Hanae, t-that's too good!" unable to hold back anymore, he'd release his load into her, while letting out a moan himself, his weak body now laying completely limp, his breathing being a bit too ragid for normal.* - Wed Nov  4 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) hearing her cough, and gag, he'd panic, trying to move but finding himself unable to, his body actually too weak now, from lack of food, and poor health, he'd start to cry. Worried about being weak, and about Hanae he'd say, "I-I'm sorry. . .d-don't hurt me again. . .I-I didn't mean to let it out." tearing forming at his eyes as he spoke.* - Wed Nov  4 02:08:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) embarrassed about being fead, he'd blush heavily, only taking a few bites, much like usal before saying, "I-I don't need anymore. . that's enough to fill me up." saying such, while in reality he really needed to eat more, and years of neglect had tricked his stomach into thinking this was a normal amount of food.* - Wed Nov  4 02:12:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) still feeling pretty crappy, as his body was still well below normal levels, he'd simply look down, pouting a bit. "B-But. . .I-I still don't feel good."* - Wed Nov  4 03:25:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: But you need to eat more then. - Wed Nov  4 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: and stop playing games. - Wed Nov  4 03:35:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Or try. - Wed Nov  4 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Thats a very annoying thought to hve.. - Wed Nov  4 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: have* - Wed Nov  4 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looks down away from her, "F-For some reason I'm never hungry. . .I-It's not like I don't want to eat." basically saying to her that she was right, and he didn't eat almost at all.* - Wed Nov  4 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Then you need to.. - Wed Nov  4 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Eat something every three hours. - Wed Nov  4 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Hungry or not. - Wed Nov  4 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: W-Why? - Wed Nov  4 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: So your body gets what it needs. - Wed Nov  4 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking down to his boney body he'd say, "I-I guess. . .just my tummy never feels like it wants food." saying such, he'd eye the food that Hanae had set aside, wanting to feel better as fasy as he could.* - Wed Nov  4 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Well. - Wed Nov  4 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: . . . - Wed Nov  4 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Hmm. - Wed Nov  4 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) still feeling over all in a bad way, he'd look at her move, wondering what she was doing, "H-Hanae. . ?" though seeing her get the box, he'd gulp a bit, "W-What are you doing. . .I-I still don't feel well." though aside from that he wouldn't complain as he cringed a bit with the bands being put onto him. Shaking his head a bit, "A-Are we really going to do this again? I-I might really break before out wedding."

though as it seemed she was going to keep going anyway, feeling her start to put the gag around him, he'd start to protest, only getting gagged up by the ball obviously, muffling what he was saying. Looking at her with scared eyes, he wanted to know why she was suddenly in the mood for all of this. Cringing, and closing his eyes even more as the clamps were put onto him.

Now being tied to the bed, he'd already be breathing a bit hard, uncomfortable as Hanae didn't even ask to do this, and he'd only ever seen bad things happen when she got forceful.

Though, even all of this wasn't enough to make him completely panic. That is, until the collar was put onto him, His eyes going even wider now, he'd almost start to panic, already moving his head around, digging into his neck right away. He felt like he was going to throw up, panicing a bit, though he felt if he did, he'd choke on it because of the gag, so in turn, he'd be left to her mercy.* - Wed Nov  4 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Even wtih all this you are just as stiff hard as before..I like it. - Wed Nov  4 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to Hanae as she began to cut herself, he'd move his head around, cutting into his skin again. Looking to her he'd want to speak, but of course would be unable to. Feeling the blade against him, he'd panic even more, to the point that blood would start to show up in small placed on his neck.

Hearing what she had said about cutting into him everytime he came, he'd close his eyes, his entire being now devoted to not coming, while it may drive him crazy, he'd hopefully be able to restrain himself. Though, feeling her slide onto him, he'd moan loudly into the gag.  

While also concentrating on not cumming, he'd also accidently feel her all the better, basically drooling all over the gag. Looking up to her though, he knew her cutting herself was a way of pleasure, but he'd cry, he didn't like seeing her hurt herself, and it was getting to him. 

By the time this was all said and done, he'd likely be completely broken unless something changed between start and finish.* - Wed Nov  4 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) watching as the blade was thrown to the floor, relief would go through his body. Then, feeling the collar go, he'd feel even better, letting his focus on not cumming slip away. Though, feeling her start to kiss his neck, he'd moan even more into the gag, apparently his third hidden spot was to have his neck licked, or kissed, which added with her hands in his hair, his eyes would almost roll back a bit.

The slow pace getting to him, he'd hold back a bit, knowing it'd be painful to cum, the threat of having two bands only making it worse. Though, losing himself a bit, hearing her whisper into his ear, his frail body would start to thrust into her the best he could, which being frail, and tied down, it'd be only a little bit. Moaning loadly into the gag, saliva would have coated it.

Feeling her face in his shoulder, he'd feel her pick up speed, wanting it even harder, he'd moan a bit more, feeling about on edge for his first round about to come to an end as he'd start to pulse a bit, a sign obviously, though not that it'd matter as the bands were present.* - Wed Nov  4 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her breathe on his shoulder, he'd moan a bit, his tongue rubbing around the gag blocking it mouth. Hearing what Hanae was saying, he'd feel himself start to twitch more, he was beginning to lose himself a bit. Attempting to pull on the ropes holding his arms, being there there were so many things he wanted to grab a hold of.

Feeling her tighten up around him, he'd again moan into the gag, his eyes rolling back a bit as he could no longer handle the teasing he had been recieving. Again pulling against the ropes, he'd likely hurt his own wrist, though, he wouldn't even notice it.

Though, as he was already close to the edge, he'd finally be driven over it when he heard the statement about her wanting to swallow his cum, which was somewhat of a twisted fantasy of his. Letting out probably the loudest-muffled moan yet, he'd cum once, though it'd get stopped by the first band.* - Wed Nov  4 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her start to move faster on top of him, being that he had just cum, he'd again moan into the gag, he was breaking a bit and didn't know what to do about it. Thus, he'd simply let himself break, trying again to thrust into her, but having a hard time because of the ropes, which were also stopping him from grabbing onto anything. Though, while all of this was happening, his eyes would be a bit faint.* - Wed Nov  4 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Watching as she moved off of him, he'd moan a small bit again. Watching, wide eyed, as she went to move him back to her other hole, he'd clench his fist a bit. Feeling her lower herself onto him, feeling his tip enter, and then a bit more of him, he'd lose it. To him, it felt really good for some reason, and thus, he'd pull against all of the ropes holding him again, trying to thrust deeper into her, even if it was just a bit.

Moaning into the gag again, he'd be going a bit crazy, feeling like he was getting more pleasure than he deserved.* - Wed Nov  4 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her slide down just a bit more, he'd again moan into the gag, which was now covered in his spit. Feeling the difference with this hole, he'd be on the verge again, starting again to twitch. 

Pulling against the ropes on his wrist, he'd like have rope burn quite badly now, though, his eyes rolling back once more, he'd begin to twitch even more, suddenly cumming again, and going limp on the bed, the pain from the build up starting to get to him.* - Wed Nov  4 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her continue to move, he'd moan a louder, and constantly, he wasn't able to contain himself anymore, and wanted the gag and ropes off, but he assumed that wasn't going to happen. Feeling the slow movement of her, he'd already feel like he was going to burst again, being that he was feeling it more than ever.

Tears coming to his eyes now, being that the pain of cumming three times was too much for him at this point, and he knew it would only get worse.* - Wed Nov  4 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) suddenly being released from everything, he'd remove the rope from his wrist and ankles, and the gag probably faster than Hanae had probably seen him do anything. Quickly jumping forward, he'd try to tackle her down to the ground. 

If he could get away with this, he'd rub his member against her stomach as he leaned it, trying to bite hard into her neck, "So, what was that about wanting to swallow it? I'm sure my next time will be more than enough to choke you." saying such, he'd take one hand, pinching at one of her nipples, -hard-, and the other hand would go to her clit, pinching that as well.* - Wed Nov  4 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) hearing what she had said, he'd simply smirk, moving to turn around, and have it so he was above her, looking down at her folds, and his member was over her. If so, he'd simply spread her a bit.

Leaning forward, he'd begin to lick at her folds and such, proding his tongue a bit at first. Though, deciding that it wasn't good enough for what she had done to him, he'd move to her clit, licking it teasingly at first before simply going in and -biting- it. While he did this, his fingers would replace his tongue in proding into her folds.* - Wed Nov  4 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling his tip beginning to get licked, he'd in turn let out a few gasps. Though, it would seem she'd stop when he started to have his way with her. Pausing to speak to her he'd say, "I don't care about fair. You had me held back, from -anything- " saying such he'd ove back down, one hand going to her clit to squeeze, and play with it, and his other hand would be placed near her folding, proding her still with his fingers. 

"Plus, who said you could stop?" refering to he not pleasing him at the moment. Saying such, he'd move his head towards one of her legs, literally biting into her thigh, likely hard enough to leave a scar which, even with time -might- still show small signs of it happening. Of course drawing blood with this, he'd go to lick it afterwards.

If it wasn't obvious, the rare side of Remy was out to play.* - Wed Nov  4 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her take him in again, he'd gasp, enjoying it. Starting to leak a bit of pre-cum into her mouth as she ran her tongue over him. Pulling back from her thigh, he'd catch sight of how wet it was getting, "Oh~ So someone is excited?" saying such he'd say, "Take it back in, and swallow it this time~" saying such, he'd lean his head down to her folds, licking like a dog thirsty for water. Proding his tongue in and out of her, he'd get an idea for some pay back.

Moving his hands free, he'd somewhat put them under her, and raise her slightly to where he could get his fingers to her other hole. Doing such, he'd prod and push his finger into her.

Coming up from licking he'd say, "Better be ready~" saying such, as he was wanted to see if she'd really swallow his juices, he'd move back in, licking and proding like a beast. 

Again, Remy's -very- rare side was out, this would be Hanae's one chance to enjoy it.* - Wed Nov  4 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling him go into her mouth again, he'd moan slightly. Feeling her bite down a small bit, he'd cringe, yet get a bit of pleasure out of it he'd say, "Oh? I see how it is." saying such, but being cut off as he was taken all taken all the way into her, he'd chuckle a bit, "Y-You've gotten too good at that." 

Looking down at all of the juices coming out of her, he'd lean down, ravaging her with his mouth and tongue, while his free hand gave it one more hard squeeze, though, not caring about what it did to her at the moment as he felt himself coming to the edge.

Thrusting his hips down into her mouth, he'd try to get as far back as he could, suddenly starting to pull out of her mouth as he'd moan out loudly, letting himself explode on the exit, likely coating everything from her throat, to even a little bit on her face, being that he had been backed up a bit from the bands before. 

Gasping some he'd say, "B-Better swallow it." being that if she didn't, he had quite a plan.* - Wed Nov  4 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her gasp, and watching her juices squirt out, he'd slowly get up, moving to grab a towel and wipe himself off, feeling less. . .nervous? than usual he'd move and wipe her as well, being somewhat loving about it. Moving the towel to a clean portion, he'd wipe her mouth for her.

Throwing the towel to the side, he'd move to lay beside her, wrapping his arms around her, and attempting to kiss her a bit. After all of this, he'd somewhat return to normal, "D-Did I do well?" Saying such he'd cuddle into her.* - Thu Nov  5 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her, he'd blush heavily, "I love you honey bun."* - Thu Nov  5 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I love you cuddle bug. - Thu Nov  5 00:25:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Rubbing his neck a bit, "I-I'm the one who is meant to buy the ring. . .remember? I may be cute. . .but I'm still a guy." pausing he'd say, "None of that matter though. . .let's just get someone of importance to marry us now."* - Thu Nov  5 00:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) seeing her walking over, and starting to move to kiss him, he'd turn his head, attempting to make it so that it was on his lips, and he'd also attempt to slip his tongue into her mouth.

If sucessful, he'd pull back, looking to the ground, face pure read, "I-I'd like that. . .and I only seem to know what I want in the middle of it all. . ." pausing again he'd move to cling to her, "I love you."* - Thu Nov  5 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Awh, cuddle bug. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Does the same, but pulls one to the side about a 'special ' order.* - Thu Nov  5 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Hmmm thanks. - Thu Nov  5 01:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Okay. - Thu Nov  5 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Cuddle bug. - Thu Nov  5 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: Hm? - Thu Nov  5 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: What you doing? - Thu Nov  5 04:47:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I'm pregnant. - Thu Nov  5 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I got a gift. - Thu Nov  5 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: you a gift.* - Thu Nov  5 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her, he'd look to the bag, "A-Ah. . .thanks I guess? D-Did you get the rings?"* - Thu Nov  5 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Yes I did. - Thu Nov  5 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: G-Good. . . - Thu Nov  5 04:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: S-Sure. - Thu Nov  5 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) taking the ring, he'd hold out his own hand, looking to Hanae, his eyes watering with her little speech that she had given. Moving to put the ring on her finger he'd smile slightly.

"Hanae, You're the only thing I could possibly love. . .I-I never let anyone touch me until you rubbed your foot against my ankle because I was supposedly 'cute'." chuckling about this, as he was trying to add a bit of humor he'd go on to say, "You're the only one I can be calm around. . .well. . .unless we're. . you know." blushing heavily, he'd be rambling, "I couldn't bring myself to even want to be around anyone but you Hanae. . .and I never want to be even an inch apart unless we have to be." saying such, he'd basically be about to ball his eyes out with tears, being that he was a big softy.* - Thu Nov  5 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) putting her ring on her, he'd lean in to kiss her back.

Mumbling to her once the kiss was broken, "I have a gift for you later, I don't know if you'll like it or not."* - Thu Nov  5 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Awh so sweet. - Thu Nov  5 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: S-Should we go tell Zenaki and everyone else? - Thu Nov  5 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Every one ells is sleep or busy. - Thu Nov  5 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: O-Oh. - Thu Nov  5 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her he'd say, "I-I asked the crafts people what erotic things had been made for people. . .and well. . ." pulling out a seperate box, he'd open it, revealing two different rings. One, a large gold circle which was too big to fit around a finger, and another very small one that looked like a peircing that would attach to well, the most sensitive part. 

Gulping a bit he'd mumble shyly, "T-They said it was a his and her set." saying such  he'd look to the ground, more embarrassed than he had ever been in his life, "I-If you don't want to do that to yourself I'll take it back."* - Thu Nov  5 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: His and hers set. - Thu Nov  5 05:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: W-Won't it hurt putting yours on? - Thu Nov  5 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Yup. - Thu Nov  5 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov  5 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Sets them to the side for now, "W-We can put them on later. . ."* - Thu Nov  5 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I bet you cant wait my little pervy man. - Thu Nov  5 05:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-It just holds it back until ya know. . .it has to force past. - Thu Nov  5 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Okay. - Thu Nov  5 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: B-But your is permenant. . . - Thu Nov  5 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: A-Are you okay with that? - Thu Nov  5 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Yeah. - Thu Nov  5 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: You want to put mine on? - Thu Nov  5 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: On me - Thu Nov  5 05:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Yeah. - Thu Nov  5 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Nodding a bit, he'd grab the item, looking to her somewhat embarrassed.* - Thu Nov  5 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Okay here goes nothing. - Thu Nov  5 05:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: really - Thu Nov  5 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Kneeling down, this would be the first time he'd be able to actually get a good look at her. Blushing he'd simply line the ring up, snapping it closed on it, likely causing -ALOT- of pain and pleasure. "A-Alright, done." while saying such, he'd start to get a bit hard from looking at her. Standing up, he'd glance away from her, blushing.* - Thu Nov  5 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Gulping a bit, getting fully hard, a bulge would form in his pants. Looking to her he'd say, "S-So I guess you like it?"* - Thu Nov  5 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I...Like it yes.. - Thu Nov  5 05:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Catching sight of this, he'd gulp a bit, reaching for the other circle in the box, he'd take his and turn away from her, being that it was only fair. Putting it on himself, with his pants still on, he'd turn back, "H-Hanae. . .d-don't hide it. . .i-its a-a turn on. . ." pausing and gulping down a bit more spit he'd say, "Y-You can do whatever you want to me to help you. . ."* - Thu Nov  5 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her a bit longingly, he'd pull his own pants and boxers off, standing there at full staff, the ring around his base, "B-But what about this H-Hanae?"* - Thu Nov  5 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I don't know..take care of it your self.. - Thu Nov  5 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: no way letting remy in....he'll lose it he wont stop.. - Thu Nov  5 06:04:48 2015
