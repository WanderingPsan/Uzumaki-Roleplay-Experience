<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: What? - Thu Nov 12 18:13:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Because I don't want a monster walking around my village. - Thu Nov 12 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Being around Kiyoko.... - Thu Nov 12 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: People seem to think I'm one. - Thu Nov 12 18:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov 12 18:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Which is a bit aggravating. - Thu Nov 12 18:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing the words spoken by Yan, he'd freeze. His anger instantly rising, "You have no right! Leave my family out of this!" saying such, his fist would begin to clench a bit, his mind already moving back to the past during which he had killed his own family in a rage. Now finding himself on the edge, he'd glare at Yan.* - Thu Nov 12 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...You actually did.... - Thu Nov 12 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Your mother....your father.... - Thu Nov 12 18:19:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You monster.... - Thu Nov 12 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) hearing his words he'd finally lose it. His hands clenching at this point, he'd look to Yan, "Shut up!" as he said such, the telltale signs of his transformation starting, a orange-red marking starting to work its way over his body, and half of his face. One of hid eyes twisting into a black and yellow form.

His teeth forming into points, he'd look to Yan, for once he wouldn't speak out in this form, simply staring the man down, as now his murderous form only saw prey in front of him.

Quickly raising an arm, he'd shoot it out, aiming to wrap around the Yan he thought was real, though in the start of the transformation, he lost track, and wouldn't have a clue which one was real.* - Thu Nov 12 18:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Watching as the man disapeared under the ground, he'd be somewhat angered. Pulling his arm back in, he'd look to the clones as they stood there. Shaking his head, he'd think that they were simply worthless, and had no point being that they were just standing there. Glancing around, he'd be discontent about the loss of his target.

Though, upon feeling hands on his legs, he'd instinctively try to kick, and stop and whatever had grabbed at him, struggling to get out of the boy's grip. If Yan let go, he'd attempt to change his arm into a weapon, the shape of a piston forming at his elbow, and then, in turn would aim to slam said arm into the ground, trying to break it, and pull Yan out.

Though, if he was pulled in, he'd of course be stuck there, no real way to get out of the hole he was put it.* - Thu Nov 12 18:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being stuck in the hole, he'd be anything but calm, his anger still flowing. Looking up to Yan with anger in his eyes, he'd shake around, trying his best to get anything out that he could, be it eve an arm.* - Thu Nov 12 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is this the extent of your will to not turn into that monster? - Thu Nov 12 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Still wiggling in the ground, while usually the marks on his body would progress, and turn him into a full monster, he'd slowly start to revert back again, being completely immobilized. Once he had changed all the way back, his head would slump. 

While he didn't remember what was said or done once his transformation had started, he did remember what had been said to cause it, and that, would bring back bad memories. These memories coming back, with his head still slumped he'd begin to tear up.

They obviously weren't good memories.* - Thu Nov 12 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: .... - Thu Nov 12 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Keeping his face hidden from Yan, he'd slowly move to dig his way out. Not wanting Yan to see his face at this moment, as soon as he was able to get out of the hole, he'd turn away, wiping his face. 

"W-Why did you have to bring that up? I-I hate myself for it. . .I didn't mean to do it." saying such, he'd wait for some sort of reaction, "I guess you believe I'm a monster now?"* - Thu Nov 12 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Because you need to remember everyday what caused you to kill your mother and father. - Thu Nov 12 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov 12 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And you need to use every fiber in your being to make sure you never hurt anyone that you love ever again. - Thu Nov 12 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I-It's harder than you know. - Thu Nov 12 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You have the ability for a reason. I believe in your ability to tame that power. - Thu Nov 12 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Everytime you think you are about to transform unwillingly, think about your mother and your father. - Thu Nov 12 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov 12 19:09:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: C-Can we stop talking about it for now. . ? - Thu Nov 12 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah. Return to the village. Like I said, no sparring unless it's a jounin or higher. - Thu Nov 12 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Wiping his face again, his back to Yan still, he'd nod, trying to walk back off to the village, planning to go lay down unless stopped.

It would appear Aza was more sensitive that he normally showed.* - Thu Nov 12 19:12:00 2015
