<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Simply watched this exchange, shaking his head slightly, mumbling, "Fools, always acting ridiculously." sighing at this thought, he'd move to turn, walking back off to his house. He couldn't handle what was happening.* - Mon Nov 23 00:22:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: This is strictly a cleaning service. - Mon Nov 23 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: E-Eh. . .if I let you have the bed. . .and slip on the couch, could it be cheaper? It's not that I don't have the money. . . - Mon Nov 23 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: That and shopping and cooking. - Mon Nov 23 02:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I can't bring myself to do anything in the bedroom other than clean it. - Mon Nov 23 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: So payment please. - Mon Nov 23 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Sighing slightly, he'd nod sadly, his thoughts being on who used to live here with him, "Here. . ." he'd quickly toss her a bag of money.* - Mon Nov 23 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) thinks: I guess the price can go down... I don't know.. - Mon Nov 23 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Just. . . - Mon Nov 23 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I dunno. . . - Mon Nov 23 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Make it that much for two months or something? - Mon Nov 23 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I guess I'll start out here. - Mon Nov 23 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Asking such, he'd move to sit in his usual seat, likely the only non-dusty part of the room, as it was the only part of the house he used.* - Mon Nov 23 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: To get my service its 25k plus what type you need. - Mon Nov 23 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I see. . . - Mon Nov 23 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: But if your going to let me stay in here like live. - Mon Nov 23 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I guess it shouldn't be a lot. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Mhm. . .the house is yours. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I just need this spot right here. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Use the house as you wish. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I'll have talk it over with my..friend. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Friend? - Mon Nov 23 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: For food what do your normaly eat? - Mon Nov 23 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: So i know what to buy. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . .Honestly. . . - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I've fallen to eatting packaged food, or not eatting. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: So get whatever. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: Okay. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) thinks: so depressing. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) thinks: must be really lonely. - Mon Nov 23 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to her, he'd smile a small bit, a past happiness of his face as if he was back in time would flash for a moment before it fell to what it usually was now-a-days, "I guess it's weird for me to want you to myself isn't it?" looking back to the table, he'd continue to have flash backs.* - Mon Nov 23 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Oh. . .alright then. - Mon Nov 23 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) sighing slightly, his evil aura would be basically doing nothing, as he wasn't motivated to hurt this girl. Laying his head on the table he'd close his eyes, trying to get the old images out of his head.* - Mon Nov 23 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing her hum, he'd suddenly smile, it drawing something out of him, thus, opening his eyes, he'd look towards Evvie, a -very- small smile on his face.

"Beautiful" talking both about her and the song, though, he was unsure why he had said it. Shaking his head and closing his eyes, he'd lay his had back on the semi-dusty table.* - Mon Nov 23 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head lightly he'd speak out, "Don't worry about shopping right now. .I stocked up on stuff." Pointing tiredly to a cabinet, it would be shown to have a bunch of packaged food, though even those seemed to not be touched recently.* - Mon Nov 23 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: You don't want a home cooked meal? - Mon Nov 23 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I guess makes my job a lot easer. - Mon Nov 23 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I mean. . . - Mon Nov 23 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: It'd be nice. But you don't have to. . . - Mon Nov 23 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I'm used to that stuff anyway. - Mon Nov 23 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) As she walked by, he'd smake dat ass. -omit-* - Mon Nov 23 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: *Smack - Mon Nov 23 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) As she walked by, she'd find nothing under the cushions. Though, when she got to the one he was sitting on, he'd wouldn't move, he'd still have his head on the table, and his eyes closed, "Thanks. . .for cleaning. . .and even being here Evvie. . .though, I never gave you my name. . .I'm Aza." pausing he'd hold his hands over his head, his evil Aura held beneath his skin, "Um. . .people around town are going to call me a monster. And it's true. . .so if you end up not wanting to work here, it's fine. Even though I can control it now."* - Mon Nov 23 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: R-right.. - Mon Nov 23 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I think this room is clean - Mon Nov 23 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: Is there anything ells you need done in ehre? - Mon Nov 23 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: here* - Mon Nov 23 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: If you find any dirt I'll clean it up right away. - Mon Nov 23 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Not in here. . . - Mon Nov 23 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I'll be moving to the bed room. - Mon Nov 23 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: O-Oh. Alright. . . - Mon Nov 23 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: Are your sheets clean? - Mon Nov 23 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Should be. . .I havent even sat on that bed. . .in a long time. - Mon Nov 23 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: Okay. - Mon Nov 23 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I'll have clean them thin. - Mon Nov 23 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having stood to watch, he'd cringe a bit as she went around the room like it was nothing. Though, he couldn't bring himself to look at it but so much.

If she were to check the bathroom, she'd see -two- toothbrushes, his, and Nari's and two towels as well, as he couldn't bring himself to get rid of them, "Y-You'll see a set of things in the bathroom. . .it should be clean, I cleaned up after my shower today. . ." pausing and wiping an eye he'd say, "T-Throw away the towel and toothbrush that isn't blue. . ."* - Mon Nov 23 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Unable to bring himself to look at it, he'd already know, "M-My. ." trailing off he'd say, "A girl used to live here with me. One day she up and left. Didn't even take anything with her." of course it was a lie, but he couldn't bring himself to say anything about it. "It was her pot."

Though, everything he was doing currently was to help himself. He wanted some company he could at least -pretend- to be good around, while in reality he -hated- just about everyone, and only worked over everyone for his own gain.

He thought that perhaps this one person in front of him could be the one person he fooled into believing he was a nice person.* - Mon Nov 23 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: Oh. - Mon Nov 23 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: Well do you want me to throw it out or. - Mon Nov 23 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I-I don't smoke. . . - Mon Nov 23 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: Okay trash it is. - Mon Nov 23 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) She would of course find more sheets, and even durning such, he'd look away, unable to take the change from what used to be Nari's room as well. Though, not because it made him sad, he was already a depressed person. It was simply because he was dark. He had done terrible things, and it seemed like someone was trying to change that, even though all she was doing was cleaning.

Dark thoughts suddenly popping into his head though, blocking out any other ones, <I should fuck her. . .she had a nice ass.>* - Mon Nov 23 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Catching sight of more of her thighs, and the figure of her ass bent over, he'd gulp a bit. For the first time in a long time, his member would harden a tad, "A-Ah. . .D-Don't forget about the bathroom. . ." saying such, he'd just stare, not even realizing he was hard, and thus, wouldn't cover it.* - Mon Nov 23 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Of course would follow to the door, still not realizing his 'predicament' as he watched her a bit.* - Mon Nov 23 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Watching her clean, feeling rather bad, it would likely be late into the night now, and she'd likely have missed her chance to talk to the shop owner. Though, these thoughts being pushed from his head, as he kneeled, feeling tired. Though, doing such, he'd catch sight of her panties. Gulping heavily, he'd not realize it, but he'd be fully erect, it showing in an outline on his pants. Standing up, he'd try to look away, still not realizing how hard he was, too distracted.* - Mon Nov 23 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head lightly, wanting to move forward, and grab her, he'd gulp a bit. He knew if he did, that she'd leave. Thus, he'd suddenly realize his issue. Shifting his legs a bit, trying to hide it, and trying to pull his jacket down, and block it he'd get out, "U-Um. . .thanks. . .for everything."* - Mon Nov 23 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: Do you need to use bath room? - Mon Nov 23 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I should get out incase you do - Mon Nov 23 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: U-Um. . .M-Maybe. . .I haven't decided. . . - Mon Nov 23 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Thinking about handling himself, he'd shake his head, thinking it was a bad idea if she heard him, being that it had been a -long- while. Moving to follow her, if for some reason she were to look at his crotch, she -might- notice it as he was trying to hide it. "Thanks again. . .I'll ah. . .go sleep in my usual spot. ." saying such, he'd attempt to walk to the living room to the table, in his seat, and lean on the table, adding to back pain he'd had for awhile.

Though before he did, he'd look back, catching sight again if her legs were still spread, not helping his issue, "U-Um. . .if I can ever do anything for you."* - Mon Nov 23 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Mon Nov 23 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Was passed out leaning on the table, likely very back for his back.* - Mon Nov 23 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Even after an hour, and all of her shopping and likely noise, he'd still be asleep, though, waking up near when she was done witht he luandry, he'd grunt a bit, mumbling. "Gah. . .back pain. . ."* - Mon Nov 23 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: Back hurts? - Mon Nov 23 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: Massage? - Mon Nov 23 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: H-Huh? - Mon Nov 23 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: U-Um. . .if you want. . . - Mon Nov 23 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: Go ahead lay on the floor - Mon Nov 23 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: is it lower back or. - Mon Nov 23 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: All of it. . . - Mon Nov 23 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Nodding slightly, he'd painfully basically just fall to his side and roll over onto his stomach, if for some reason she were to look at his behind, she'd see it rather toned and nice, and his back, were she to feel it, would be covered in scares, and be rather hard to the touch.* - Mon Nov 23 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: *scars - Mon Nov 23 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Feeling her hands on his back, he'd be curious to how she was sitting being that it felt like her hands were coming fromt he front of him. Glancing up quickly, he'd be met with nothing but whatever she was wearing, if she was wearing anything.

Blushing heavily regardless, he'd put his head back down, fidgeting his lower half a bit. Though, he'd also let a sigh of pleasure release as she rubbed his back. 

He was being assaulted on all sides, and didn't know what to do.* - Mon Nov 23 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Again looking up quickly, he'd catch another eyefull, affecting him even more as he hardened from the sight. Gulping a bit, he'd wiggle a bit, trying not to be an any pain as it hit the floor, "Y-You have no idea." saying such though, his back pain would act up. Grunting a bit, he'd lay still.

"Y-You're really good at this." saying such, he'd again sigh, somewhat erotically as she massaged him.* - Mon Nov 23 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Feeling her lean to his lower back, he'd again sigh out in pleasure, though, being unable to resist himself, he'd turn his head, and glance up, seeing her panties hugging her folds. Again squirming in a way that would be -very- noticable, he'd huff a bit, Evvie liking feeling the air on her legs, and maybe even up to her place, though, if she were to look, he'd have his eyes closed like he wasn't paying any attention.

"I-I think the ah. . .walls. . .look just fine."* - Mon Nov 23 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Stopping her, or at least trying to as his back pain acted up, he'd get about a foot off the ground before falling, "W-Wait." saying such though as he grunted in pain, he'd not only still have back pain, but he would have had hsi member hit the ground. "O-Ow. . ." saying such, he'd close his eyes a bit.

"W-Where are you going?" saying such through pain.* - Mon Nov 23 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: To my room. - Mon Nov 23 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: This is strictly business. I'm sorry for putting you in a awkward situation. - Mon Nov 23 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: N-No. - Mon Nov 23 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I-I still need help. .  - Mon Nov 23 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Wouldn't mention his now enlarged member but would say, "M-My back hurts even more. . .I don't think I can move." it wasn't 100% true, he could move, but it hurt rather much.* - Mon Nov 23 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I .. - Mon Nov 23 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I can help you to the couch. - Mon Nov 23 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: U-Uh! - Mon Nov 23 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: N-No! - Mon Nov 23 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: J-Just um. . . - Mon Nov 23 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Finish the massage just um. . .don't sit in front of me. - Mon Nov 23 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I.. - Mon Nov 23 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: sorry I just. - Mon Nov 23 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Before she closes the door he'd say, "I-I'm sorry, it was my fault for looking. . .a-and now. . .I'm having issues." saying such, as his back was in pain, along with his member.

Sighing slightly he'd also mumble, "I-I haven't been excited over a girl. . s-since. " trailing off he'd simply lay his head on the ground and close his eyes, hoping that he could just fall asleep there, or die, which ever came first.* - Mon Nov 23 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Would eventually fall asleep there, his member softening over time. Though, let's be realistic, you think back pain is gonna get -better- from sleeping on the floor?

Eventually, he'd wake up, in even more pain with a stiff back. "D-Damn. . ."* - Mon Nov 23 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Noting that if he was picked up, she'd feel rather hard muscels in her hands, and depending on how she layed him on the couch, she'd perhaps notices his chub still going away.* - Mon Nov 23 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I apologize I really do. - Mon Nov 23 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) was out cold.* - Mon Nov 23 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) thinks: Bet it feels good to have sex..touching my self is good but..what would sex be like.. - Mon Nov 23 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: phew - Mon Nov 23 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) says: I need a shower. - Mon Nov 23 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being that when she came out, he'd still be passed out, though, something might seem wrong at first as he was grunting and sighing in his sleep. "N-Nari. . .Y-You really like . . ." trailing off he'd come in a bit later, "D-Drink. . ."trailing off again, he'd roll over, his body laying so that he was on his back, and his member would be noticed fully hard against his pants, he was obviously having a 'good' dream.* - Mon Nov 23 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) thinks: I cant shower again...but have shake this feeling... - Mon Nov 23 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Mumbling in his sleep again, his choice would suddenly change, "E-Evvie. . .W-Why? W-What?" his dream taking a weird turn. Though it would seem as if by some impossibility, he got even harden, twitching being noticed in his pants.

"W-Why, H-how."* - Mon Nov 23 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Evvie(Ej247) thinks: I want to watch but if I'm caught....I just can't hold it in. - Mon Nov 23 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Grunting a bit in his sleep once more, he'd suddenly groan out, "E-Evvie. . N-Not there. . .Y-You don't have to l-lic-" trailling off again, he'd probably be hard enough to the point it was causing pain, being that he hadn't done anything since he killed Nari.

"I-I'm At-trac-ted t-to you b-but you don't have t-" again trailing off in his dream.* - Mon Nov 23 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Suddenly rolling over as if he was avoiding something, he'd hit the floor, and instantly wake up, having fallen onto his back, he'd have caught full sight of Evvie, and of his own hard member. Unsure of what to do, he'd feel -very- awkward. The want to move in on Evvie pretty strong, yet he didn't need to lose another person.

Feeling it was his fault, he'd say quickly, "I-I'm sorry! I-" though before he could finish, he'd run to the bathroom, still not taking care of himself, as he had sworn not to after he had killed Nari.* - Mon Nov 23 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Eventually coming back out, still hard as it wouldn't go away, he'd block it with his hands, and a spare coat. Moving back to sit on the couch he'd mumble, "T-This is my fault. . .I-I shouldn't have brought a girl into the house after so long without. . ." saying such he'd blush and look down.

"I-I. . .Just forget what you saw. . .and I'll do the same?" saying such, even though he really wanted to throw her down and ravage her right there, he'd hold back, he didn't want the village to have another reason to kill him yet.* - Mon Nov 23 07:03:40 2015
