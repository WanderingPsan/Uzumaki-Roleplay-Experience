<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to her, he'd be a bit aggravated, "I just wanna move o-" though as she suddenly took him in, letting him slowly move through her mouth and further, he'd groan a bit.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having slid all the way into her, and then feeling her start to move back, he'd suddenly lose it, letting himself release all down her throat, and if she pulled back, likely into her mouth and on her face, as he had been saving up a rathe large amount for her. Being that she seemed to like to drink it.* - Mon Nov 16 01:49:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: You're annoying me. - Mon Nov 16 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: W-why are you being so mean? - Mon Nov 16 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) saying such, he'd rub his head a bit.* - Mon Nov 16 03:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I'm annoyed. - Mon Nov 16 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Whatever I did I'm sorry. - Mon Nov 16 03:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Stop apologizing. - Mon Nov 16 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: It's pathetic. - Mon Nov 16 03:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: I'm confused. - Mon Nov 16 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: You just... - Mon Nov 16 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: *sighs* - Mon Nov 16 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Still standing in front of it, he'd get somewhat forceful with his words, some unknown form of anger getting to him, "No, you aren't. You're staying here."* - Mon Nov 16 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Move away from the door Aza. - Mon Nov 16 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: So I can go outside. - Mon Nov 16 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I said no Nari. - Mon Nov 16 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Please move. - Mon Nov 16 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Grabbing her with one arm, again forcefully throwing her back, he'd say, "I said no!" His anger again getting a bit higher.* - Mon Nov 16 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to the puppet, his anger would sky rocket, "Is that a threat Nari? Do you plan to try and fight me out of the way?!" His hand going to the doorway, would begin to squeeze it, forcefully cracking the frame.* - Mon Nov 16 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: I just want to go outside and you refuse to let me leave the room. - Mon Nov 16 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: I dont know whats happening with you but just clam down. - Mon Nov 16 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Yet you have the Puppet out Nari. . .that's a threat. . . - Mon Nov 16 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: I'm scared. - Mon Nov 16 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: I'm scared of you - Mon Nov 16 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: HAve not looked at your self? - Mon Nov 16 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing her speak out, he'd break. The last person he had loved was now afraid of him. Shaking his head, he knew he couldn't go back now, even if he did, she would always be afraid of him on some level, "Come on then! Fight me! Fight for your life!" saying such, he'd glare at her, his fist clenching as he eyed the puppet.* - Mon Nov 16 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: I wont fight you Aza. - Mon Nov 16 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Just move so I can go outside. - Mon Nov 16 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: No. - Mon Nov 16 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Why? - Mon Nov 16 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: You aren't leaving this room. - Mon Nov 16 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Why though why? - Mon Nov 16 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: It doesn't matter. - Mon Nov 16 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: If she leaves now, she won't ever come back to me. - Mon Nov 16 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: I just want to get some air. - Mon Nov 16 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I don't care. - Mon Nov 16 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: So do you not care about me? - Mon Nov 16 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Or us? - Mon Nov 16 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Watching the head on the puppet move, he'd again find himself in anger. He took that as her preparing the puppet to do something. Moving back to block the door way with his body he'd say, "Make me then!" it was clear that his anger was causing him to act in a abnormal way.* - Mon Nov 16 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: YOur angery Aza. - Mon Nov 16 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Just calm down. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Fuck off. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Its okay to be calm. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: You have your puppet ready. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) It was clear he was ready for a fight.* - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: The puppet is not ment to fight or even a threat. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: I just need you to calm down. - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Fuck you. - Mon Nov 16 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: breath calmly and listen to me. - Mon Nov 16 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Nari. Fuck. Off. Fight me. You have it out. You obviously got it out for a reason. - Mon Nov 16 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: I love you Aza. - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: *eyes tear up* - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: I love you please just calm down. - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) His anger blocking out what she had said he'd again say, "Fight me Nari! Stop waiting!" his mind clouded now as nature energy started to flood his body, a mark would start to show, letting Nari know that soon she wouldn't be able to even speak with him, as he wouldn't be in his right mind. Though, it wouldn't go so far to let him go into stage one, not yet at least. 

"Fucking C'mon!" * - Mon Nov 16 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: . . . - Mon Nov 16 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Aza. - Mon Nov 16 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Its me Nari. I just want to say I love you. No matter what happens between us no matter what others say. No matter what happens here or any where I still love you... I know you love me...Just please  calm down, calm down and come to me.. - Mon Nov 16 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Roaring out again, ignoring what she had said, the mark would continue to go over his body. Eventually getting to the first stage. His right eye changing color, along with his face and part of his body. His right arm and hand changing as well, becoming more monsterous.

"C'MON!" His anger controlling him at this point. Looking between the puppet and Nari, he didn't know which to go for first. In his mind, he knew he loved Nari. But then again, anger and hate took over, wanting her gone. Thus, his thoughts were that the only way to keep her around was to end her and force her to stay around forever.* - Mon Nov 16 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing what she had said at some level in his brain, he'd almost stop, though, it would only be for a second as anger and blood lust filled his head. That and along with the thought that if he did this, Nari would have to be with him forever, even if it was in the form of a body, he'd quickly glare to her, radiating pure danger. Glancing to the puppet, making sure that it wasn't a threat, he'd look back to Nari.

His arm, suddenly changing shape, would be that of a piston at his elboe. Glaring at Nari now, he'd say, "Die." before suddenly swinging his arm forward, aiming to hit her in her chest, trying to stop her heart, or do enough damage to literally kill her. If this went through sucessfully, he'd move to the puppet. Not wanting to take any chances as his rage drove him to kill anything that even looked like a person. 

Continuing the attack, he'd aim to smach the device down to tiny pieces, doing anything he could to destroy it.

Once he was done with everything, if it all went his way, he'd walk back to Nari's lifeless body, the monster that was currently released, mixing with his human emotion and thoughts.* - Mon Nov 16 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to the lifeless body of Nari, something inside of him snapping as his human and monster-like sides merged. He simply submitted to the power and lust for blood now. He just assumed he'd have to direct it, and stop trying to control it. Though, this would all be going on in the back of his mind. Looking around, not seeing anyone else he could kill, he'd move to the body. His sharp teeth showing in an evil smirk.

Some dark part of him threw a thought to his mind, "Eat her. She'll stay with you forever then." this thought being pushed into the forefront of his mind, he'd begin to rip the body appart, piece by piece, eatting it. Crunching the bones and all, he wouldn't leave any part of her left, he wanted her to be with him forever. Consuming the entire body in his monsterous form, he'd again go back to looking around, trying to catch sight of any target he could.

Seeing nothing, his body would revert back to its normal look, letting him be completely human. Or was he? A part of him had snapped. He came to the realization of what he had done, and for some reason remembered it all this time. Though, for some reason he wasn't upset. His anger had been quinched, though it had cost himk Nari, which built his anger up again. Though, he didn't let it rule him now, he simply accepted it.

Moving quietly to the bed, he'd grab the sheets and such. Taking them to the bathroom, he'd light them on fire with a match, burning them into nothingness. Doing the same with any of her clothes, and her puppet. Sweeping all of this to the drain, he'd turn the shower on, letting it all be washed away to nothingness.

A few things had happened to him in this instant. He no longer thought he was a monster, he knew he was one. He gained more anger and bloodlust, it having stayed and mixed in with his usual personality. Lastly, he felt closer to his transformation, as if they were coming closer together. Long story short, he had broken from what he had done and it would likely cause many others pain in the future.

Turning, after having cleared the house of anything having to do with Nari, he'd turn the lights out, not planning for anyone to find out what had happened here.* - Mon Nov 16 05:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh hey um Yan? - Mon Nov 16 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Uh, yeah--sure. - Mon Nov 16 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having walked into the area, his eyes looking a bit lifeless, or perhaps tired, as if he was simply on drone mode, he'd look around, taking note of everyone, yet not exactly caring about them im particular.* - Mon Nov 16 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to Kiyoko, he'd quickly twist his face into a smile, the previous look fading away, "Yes~ I'm fine." nodding a small bit, he'd ask, "You get that kid straight the other day?" quickly pointing to Akira, trying to change the subject.* - Mon Nov 16 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Mon Nov 16 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Keeping up the small smile, he'd say, "Sure, if you'd like. Doesn't matter to me." it would be as if he were abnormally in a good mood today.* - Mon Nov 16 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Wow. - Mon Nov 16 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well sure, let's go to the hospital then yeah? - Mon Nov 16 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Bye Kiyoko, I'll see you later yeah? - Mon Nov 16 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah of course Akira-san. - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Sure~ - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So, Yan. - Mon Nov 16 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Following Kiyoko in, his face would instantly chance, being one of apathy once more. Sitting in the back of the room once again he'd look to her, speaking in a monotoned voice, "So, no one has come to take this room yet?"* - Mon Nov 16 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Nope, looks like I'm sort of the head of hospital now. - Mon Nov 16 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Nice, Nice. - Mon Nov 16 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So whats with the fake smile? - Mon Nov 16 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Nari left me, and the village. - Mon Nov 16 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shrugging a bit he'd simply look to her, pointing to the device playing the music, "Well, no need for that." saying such, he'd keep his apathetic face. At least for a few days, it was unlikely anything would bother him. "I feel fine. She was abusive anyway right?" saying such he'd think to himself, without meaning too, <Even though she had just given up weed for me.>* - Mon Nov 16 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So she just went rogue...to leave you? - Mon Nov 16 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd say, "I have partial control." though as she asked another question he'd shake his head, "She was never a shinobi here, she considered herself a villager at most, even with her skills." sighing slightly he'd continue on, weaving his web of lies, "I came home to a note. Said she was leaving, and took everything with her. I went into a rage. Though, strangely when I did, after the first intial bit, I had control over it." 

Pausing thinking a bit more he'd say, "I don't think I could control it if it took all of my body."* - Mon Nov 16 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: W-wow.... - Mon Nov 16 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So...her leaving...actually gave you control? - Mon Nov 16 05:42:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: For the time being. . .I just have to make sure to restrain it at the first level. . . - Mon Nov 16 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: If it goes past that. . .well, I'm unsure. - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see... - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well I can't help with the second one. - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Would you be okay with me asking Yan to help you with that? - Mon Nov 16 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And...we need to test the first one. - Mon Nov 16 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . .Test it? - Mon Nov 16 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: To see if you really can resist going into it. - Mon Nov 16 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: You mean stop my first form? Or from going into the second one? - Mon Nov 16 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If we prove you can resist then they will drop any and all attempts to keep an eye on you. - Mon Nov 16 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No test to see if you can avoid going into the first one. - Mon Nov 16 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And then after we prove that we can get someone to train you to control when you go into the second one. - Mon Nov 16 05:45:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: They'll want proof right away. - Mon Nov 16 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No I can set up a meeting for it. - Mon Nov 16 05:51:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to her hand blankly he'd sigh slightly and follow.* - Mon Nov 16 05:56:41 2015
