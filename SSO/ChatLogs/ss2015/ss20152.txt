<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Blushing heavily he'd say, "I-I don't care. . .I just want to make you feel good." literally not caring about himself at all. His whole world had turned into Hanae. 

using his hands, he'd slightly rub between her legs, unsure if he was even doing it right. "U-Um. ." though not saying anything as he continued. His other hand, having likely found her nipple by now, would be squeezing down on it hard, remembering what she said about pain.* - Fri Oct 30 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing what she said, he'd have to move her shirt up, making to where he could access her nipple. Quickly leaning forward, he'd sink his teeth into it, biting as hard as he could, likely drawing a small amount of blood.

His other hand, would try to work its way into her pants, but, he couldn't figure it out, and was getting a bit frustated.* - Fri Oct 30 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her moan, he'd lick around the area a small amount, getting the blood he had drawn. Though, biting back down again, he'd say, "I-I'm glad Hanae." Saying such, he'd finally work his other hand down her pants, rubbing the outside of her soaking panties, "H-Hanae, w-what?" not knowing about why they'd be wet like that, but continued to rub anyway.* - Fri Oct 30 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: boxers - Fri Oct 30 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her giggle, he'd in turn blush red. He hadn't heard that in a long while. Looking to her he'd say, "O-Ok." Unsure of what to do, he was only a little excited himself, being that he was only thinking of helping Hanae feel good. Moving his mouth to her other nipple, he'd bite into it, quite hard, trying his best to please her. "A-Am I doing good?"

Having asked such, he'd finally work his hand into her boxers, accidently sliding his hand across her clit as he went to continue rubbing her in her boxers, trying to do his best to please her, an actual confused look on his face as he was unsure of what he was doing.* - Fri Oct 30 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her moan, he'd look up, wondering if he had done something wrong, though seeing her face, he'd blush, hard. Seeing  her smile, he'd remove his hands from her pants, not being able to contain himself.

"Hanae. . .I love you!" saying such he'd jump forward to try and her her, wrapping his arms around her. If she somehow caught sight of his pants she'd only see a slight buldge, as he had been too focused on pleasing her to even think about having any pleasure for himself. 

"I-I did. . .S-Should I keep going?" though, he already had his hands away from all of her pleasurable spots, and was hugging her.* - Sat Oct 31 00:10:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to Fuji, he'd blush, quite heavily, and as he adverted his eyes from the man, putting his head to Hanae's chest, looking quite girly, being more embarrassed than he thought he would be from Hanae letting people know.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking at her in question, he'd blush as her arms wrapped around him, and her mouth came near his ear. Hearing her whisper, he'd tear up a bit, though from happiness. Blinking the tear away, he'd move to respond.

"I-I L-Love you more Hanae. . ." though having a hard time being that he was embarrassed.* - Sun Nov  1 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Being closer to her, he'd already be blushing. Though, hearing what she said, he'd be pushed over the line, his arms wrapping around Hanae, holding on as tightly as he weak arms would let him, "H-anae. . " tears almost breaking from his eyes, he'd have quite a girly, emotional look on his face as he tried to bury it into her to hide it.* - Sun Nov  1 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling his head rubbed, and then his back, he'd start to shake his head to say no. Though, realizing who was asking, he'd move his face back for her to see, though still trying to turn it to the side to hide it, almost in tears now.* - Sun Nov  1 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Seeing Hanae's tear, it'd only make him want to cry more, though, as he had his tears wiped away, Also having his head turned, he'd be pulled into a kiss. "H-Hanae!~"* - Sun Nov  1 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Being pushed back into the bed, his lips still attached to Hanae's, he'd let out quite a girly moan, feeling her tongue in his mouth. Pushing back with his own, his face would twist in pleasure as his hair was messed with. Clearly loving every second, his hands would wrap around Hanae.* - Sun Nov  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling his shirt grabbed, and throw off, he'd blush heavily, trying to hide his pale weak body. Feeling her lips on his again, he'd kiss her back rather hard. Though, feeling her hands, he'd shiver a bit, embarrassed by it.

"S-Stop lying. . .I'm ugly and weak. . ."* - Sun Nov  1 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) hearing what she had said, he'd start to tear up again, happy at what she had said. Tilting his head to look away, he'd suddenly jump a bit, feeling her hands on his privates. Starting to stiffen a bit he'd say, "D-Don't do say that. . .it's embarrassing." saying such, he'd wiggle a bit, a girly, lustful face replacing his normal one.* - Sun Nov  1 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) having no control as the clothing covering his lower half was removed, he'd look away, embarrassed, though as he hand started to rub him again, his member would jump to life, enjoying what she was doing. 

His girly lustful face turning to Kiss Hanae back, he'd say inbetween breathes, "H-Hanae, D-Don't ever leave me. . .I-I wouldn't make it without you."* - Sun Nov  1 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) hearing what she had said, he'd blush hard, moaning at the feel of her hands, driven by lust. Feeling her kiss down his neck, and then her tongue on his nipple, he'd harden up even more in her hand, being at full staff, "H-Hanae S-Stop!~" though as he said it, he'd dig his fingers into her shoulders.* - Sun Nov  1 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) being that he was still being rubbed, and his nipples both being licked, he'd continue to moan in a girly voice, "S-Stop is Hanae~" saying such, he'd fidget around, his mouth opening, and a bit of liquid escaping, being that he was too busy enjoying himself to know what he looked like, "T-This isn't fair!"

Reaching up, he'd try to dig his nails into her shoulders, knowing she enjoyed it, though mostly cause he felt he needed something to hold onto or he'd float away with the pleasure he was recieving.* - Sun Nov  1 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her kisses on his chest, he'd be lost between that and the slow massaging of his privates. Hearing her say his name, he wouldn't even register it. He was a bit lost, and if she did anything more pleasurable, his mind might break for the rest of the experiance, and thus he'd speak out, "H-Hanae~ I-I don't know if I can handle it~ I-I might break some~" saying such in a girly way, his hands would go to her hair, grabbing on as he literally thought he was going to go crazy.* - Sun Nov  1 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) hearing what she had said, he'd feel her continue to massage him, and kiss at his chest, though he couldn't take it anymore as his tongue suddenly just fell out the side of his mouth, pleasure and lust coating his face. At this time though, he'd let lose, his member mimicing his face of pleasure as he came all over her hand, and likely her.* - Sun Nov  1 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) A lustful look on his face, his tongue still hanging out the side a bit, he'd stay like that for a few moments, not realizing. Though, after a moment, he'd regain himself, quickly fixing this and wiping his mouth.

"H-Hanae. . I S-Said I couldn't take it. . ." looking away from her, his face pure red, a pouty tsu. look on it.* - Sun Nov  1 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her snuggle up to him, he'd pout a bit more, "B-But I'm only here to please you. . ." saying such as he literally thought he was only here to be with Hanae. Turning to bury his head into the pillow he'd say, "I-It did feel good though. . ." saying such, he'd try to cover himself a bit, realizing his pale body was still open for her to see, which he was ashamed of.* - Sun Nov  1 04:01:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) If she still had an arm around him, she'd feel his heart pick up, beating rather fast. Knowing that he was about to cry from happiness again, he'd bury his face into the pillow, stopping himself. Though, with a free hand he'd wrap his hand around hers.* - Sun Nov  1 04:06:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Shakes his head a bit more pouting, "I-I know you really want to do it. . .you just like teasing me." saying such his face would puff out a bit, still pouting.* - Sun Nov  1 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I don't really want to. - Sun Nov  1 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I mean you don't see me hiding how horny I am. - Sun Nov  1 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: T-That's even worse. . . - Sun Nov  1 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I don't want to do it if you don't. . . - Sun Nov  1 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: We do it together but I want to watch you play with your self a little. - Sun Nov  1 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: W-What!? - Sun Nov  1 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Come on~ - Sun Nov  1 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I can't. . .I'd die of embarrassment. . .I-I haven't done it alone before. . . - Sun Nov  1 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: It's doesn't matter. - Sun Nov  1 04:17:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I'm not sure if I'd do it- - Sun Nov  1 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Yell if you don;t want to. - Sun Nov  1 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: Y-you aren't bored with me are you? - Sun Nov  1 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: You don't have to~ - Sun Nov  1 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Was actually worried about her being over him, thus he'd slowly roll over, "I-I will if you won't be bored of me." worried that if she got bored of him, she'd leave.* - Sun Nov  1 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I can never get bored of you. - Sun Nov  1 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Remy, you are my cuddle bug for life. - Sun Nov  1 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: - - Sun Nov  1 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I'll do it then. - Sun Nov  1 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: You don't if you don't want to. - Sun Nov  1 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Turning over to look at her he'd say, "I'll do it for you. . ." saying such he'd slowly reach down to his member, looking to her, "I-I can't do it without looking at you though. . " saying such he'd start to slowly rub himself.* - Sun Nov  1 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her, he'd blush heavily, trying again to hide his face as the sheet was removed. Then, feeling her finger on his nipple, he'd bite into his own lip. "N-Not as good as when you do it." saying such, he'd go a bit faster, his mouth letting out a bit of saliva.* - Sun Nov  1 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her moan, he'd only start to rub himself harder, watching her as it excited him a bit. Then, feeling her finger forced into his mouth, he'd go a bit crazy over the taste, licking her finger and rubbing it around it, "S-So good." saying such, he'd use his free hand to grasp at the bed.* - Sun Nov  1 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her, he'd start to rub himself faster, getting too excited, "S-Stop teasing me." saying such, he'd suddenly let out probably the girliest moan he ever had, releasing himself all over.* - Sun Nov  1 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Embarrassed he'd look away, "Y-You're mean. . .y-you just like teasing me."* - Sun Nov  1 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I don't - Sun Nov  1 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Catching her underwear, he would be too embarrassed to see what she was doing. Though, as she placed the paddle onto his chest he'd say, "W-What is this for, and where did it come from?" though hearing what she had said he'd sit up, blushing.

Grabbing the paddle he'd look to her, "A-Are you sure?" but before she could answer he'd take it, slamming it into her ass, testing it.* - Sun Nov  1 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her moan, he'd say, "I-I'm sorry." but before she'd be able to reply to that, he'd again hit her with it, seeing as it had caused her pleasure. Doing this over and over, slowly he'd feel a bit bad, not wanting to hurt her.* - Sun Nov  1 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing what she had said, and the noises she was letting out he'd say, "E-Excuse me for what I'm about to do." He figured if pain was what pleased her, he'd have to do his best, thus, he's get up and lean over her, going to her neck and sinking his teeth into it, while at the same time using the paddle to do as much damage to her ass that he could. Pulling back he'd say, "I-Its a shame I don't have anything sharp." saying such simply going with the mood as he didn't want to disapoint her.* - Sun Nov  1 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Watching as she raised her lower half up he'd say, "H-Hanae, I-I can't help myself." saying such he'd move behind her, inserting himself in, and letting out a moan himself as he did. Putting the paddle to the side he'd say, "G-grab something sharp." saying such, he'd lean forward, wrapping his arms around her mid-section, and sinking his fingers into her. Moving his hips a bit, his weak body doing the best it could he'd say, "Though you have to get is while I do this~" saying such he'd sink his teeth into her neck again.* - Sun Nov  1 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Continuing to thrust the best he could, he'd release his teeth from her neck, "What's wrong? I though I said to get something sharp, so you need too~" saying such he'd pull his fingernails across her midsection. Moving them back, he'd run his hands up to her nipples, grabbing onto them and pinching them quite hard. 

Moving back to her neck, he'd teasingly kiss it, that is, before he'd go back to biting ever harder, obviously not going to give up until her got something sharp enough to cut. Something flipping in him after having been teased so much.* - Sun Nov  1 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: lol - Sun Nov  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Pulling out of her, and letting go, he'd say, "Get it~" the usual Remy gone, something lust driven being all that was left.* - Sun Nov  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her, not fully aware what he was doing he'd say, "Bend back over~ Then I can start~" saying such he'd grab the Kunai.* - Sun Nov  1 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Not replying at first, he'd insert himself into her, not even going slow about it, "This might scar~" saying such he'd he'd start to thrust as hard as he could. Not even trying to be calm about it. Though, after a few moments, he'd just stop, leaving her probably upset. 

Taking the Kunai he'd put it into her skin, right about her ass, and like a trampstamp, in his lust, he'd start to cut into her skin. Going about it slowly as he was basically broken at this point, Hanae having not stopped him before hand to let him calm down. Cutting his own name into her he'd say, "You're mine forever~" 

Throwing the kunai to the side he'd begin to thrust again, going all out as fast as he could, he was close, and would likely go back to normal after cumming.* - Sun Nov  1 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her tighten up, he'd respond, his on pleasure getting to him. Quickly thrusting as hard as his frail body could handle, he'd lean down, getting the blood all over himself, going to bite onto Hanae's neck as he suddenly released inside of her, coating her insides. Once he had done this he'd momentarily slump on top of her.* - Sun Nov  1 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: lol - Sun Nov  1 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Slowly coming to his senses, he'd barely be able to move, in his lust driven antics, his body would have worn itself out. Lifting himself up, he'd catch sight of the blood, what he had carved in, and all of the blood that had ran onto his own body. Worried about it, he'd try to move away, though his body probably in more pain than Hanae. Falling over off of her he'd say, "W-What did I do Hanae!? W-Why is my name in your back?" saying such he'd start to tear up again.

He thought he had done something bad, thus he'd bury his head into the pillow, his eyes starting to water, yet, he was still strangely a bit hard.* - Sun Nov  1 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: B-But your back. . . - Sun Nov  1 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: M-My name is in it. . . - Sun Nov  1 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: A-Any my body hurts. - Sun Nov  1 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I'm confused. - Sun Nov  1 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: You said I was yours for ever and curved it into my back with the kunai I gave you. - Sun Nov  1 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I'm sorry. . . - Sun Nov  1 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: and you well...Don't you remember I mean it was just a few minutse ago? - Sun Nov  1 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: A-A little. . . - Sun Nov  1 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Frowns, "I remember the knife. . .and being above you. . .b-but mostly lust. . ." saying such he'd try to hug Hanae, still in pain, "A-are you ok?"* - Sun Nov  1 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I'm fine Remy. - Sun Nov  1 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I remember being excited. . . - Sun Nov  1 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Yeah, you really did enjoy your self... - Sun Nov  1 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) being still a bit hard he'd look down to himself, "I-I guess."* - Sun Nov  1 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Wow.. - Sun Nov  1 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: You must still want more~ - Sun Nov  1 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I-. . .maybe. - Sun Nov  1 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I told you you'd break me. . . - Sun Nov  1 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I-I'm all addicted now. . . - Sun Nov  1 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) trying to hide himself away again, covering his head with the pillow.* - Sun Nov  1 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Oh hmm okay I'll feed your addiction~ - Sun Nov  1 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing what she had said, and feeling the change of weight on the bed, he'd move the pillow, wanting to know what she was doing, though as he did this, he'd feel her mouth wrap around him. Her tongue moving around, and head going up and down. Moaning at this, he'd finally look to what was infront of him. Blushing heavily, he'd move his hands up to feel it. Rubbing around it, he'd feel everything, including her clit, looking for reactions.* - Sun Nov  1 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) having taken note of her reaction when he had touched that particular area, he'd say, "W-why? It was feeling good before. . ." saying such, he'd again squeeze her clit, wanting to make sure he wasn't just mistaken, though, at the same time he'd move his other hand to stick a finger inside of her, proding.


"You seemed to like it too. . ."* - Sun Nov  1 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her, he'd nod, "C-Careful? It can't be worse than what I did to your back." saying such, he'd pinch down on it, seeing how she would react. Though, feeling her mouth back around him, he'd have to stop pinching as he had a hard time controlling his own moans.

Reaching up, he'd wrap his hands around her ass, and take his mouth forward, wanting to repay her as he slightly licked her clit, wanting to see what happened.* - Sun Nov  1 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Seeing her move side to side, it'd only make him want it more, moving back to dig his tongue into her folds instead. His hand now taking over at her clit, pinching it, "H-hanae, I don't think I can hold out." saying such he'd say, "I-I wanna do it in your mouth!" saying such pervertedly, he'd bury himself back into her folds, pinching her clit still. "H-Hanae~"* - Sun Nov  1 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her take it back into her mouth, he'd keep doing his best to lick at Hanae, though, once he had been covered in her juices, his head would fall back, licking his lips trying to get all of the liquid. "S-So good." refering to the taste, and to Hanae's technique.

"H-Hanae~ I can't hold back!" saying such, he'd thrust his hips forward, suddenly releasing into her mouth. Sweating a bit afterwards, and closing his eyes as he rested on the pillow he'd say, "H-Hanae. . .C-Can we cuddle?" saying such with a really girly look, he'd give her sort of puppy dog eyes.* - Sun Nov  1 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) tucking himself under Hanae's arms, he wouldn't even worry about cleaning himself off, "I love you more."* - Sun Nov  1 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: No, I love you more. - Sun Nov  1 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: N-Nu uh! - Sun Nov  1 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: W-We have already had this talk. . . - Sun Nov  1 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: I love you more. . .and you're mine. . .and I'll always be yours. - Sun Nov  1 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov  1 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: H-How's your back? - Sun Nov  1 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: It's fine. - Sun Nov  1 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Gulps a bit, scared, "P-Pehaps you could do the same to me. . .it's only fair."* - Sun Nov  1 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: No. - Sun Nov  1 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: B-But. . . - Sun Nov  1 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: It would mess up your sexy body. - Sun Nov  1 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: . . .What about your body? - Sun Nov  1 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: My body is fine. - Sun Nov  1 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: A-And how will people know who I belong to. . . - Sun Nov  1 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: -sighs- - Sun Nov  1 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) blushes a bit and looks away.* - Sun Nov  1 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: If you want. - Sun Nov  1 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) thinks: I-it's only fair. - Sun Nov  1 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) thinks: I-I hope it won't hurt too bad. . . - Sun Nov  1 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling the point in his chest, he'd clench his eyes, already hurting from just the tip of the blade. A small bit of water forming at the edge of his eyes.* - Sun Nov  1 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Not going to lie. - Sun Nov  1 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: It's going to be painful~ - Sun Nov  1 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Tears up even more, almost crying, "I-It's only fair since I did it to you."* - Sun Nov  1 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling the blade start to cut, he'd instantly be in tears, balling his eyes out, his nose starting to run. It was obviously his frail body was in intense pain. To him, it felt like someone was using a butcher nice to cut him up for food. 

Screaming out rather loudly, anyone a room, maybe even two would be able to hear, "S-Stop! I-It Hurts!!!" saying such, he'd literally be unable to stop crying. He didn't expect her to carve it so big, or into his chest. He felt so much pain that he was on the verge to passing out. He wanted to be dead.* - Sun Nov  1 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: There... - Sun Nov  1 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Still balling tears, even more so when she applied pressure to the cuts, he'd likely cry enough for his tears to mix in with the blood from the cuts, "H-Hanae, I-It hurts so much." saying such before putting his hand to his mouth, he'd bite into himself, drawing his own blood accidentally, "S-So much pain." saying such, he'd sniffle, a fresh round of tears pouring out.* - Sun Nov  1 07:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Quit the crying. - Sun Nov  1 07:54:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: S-So much. - Sun Nov  1 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: It's going to hurt for a little bit. - Sun Nov  1 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: Y-You w-were too slow. . . - Sun Nov  1 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I had to make sure it would scar. - Sun Nov  1 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) burys his head into Hanae, "D-Don't hurt me that bad again. . .unless you have to. . .please?"* - Sun Nov  1 08:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: okay but you asked for it. - Sun Nov  1 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Hey. - Mon Nov  2 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: Hey. . . . - Mon Nov  2 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) looks to her, still rubbing his chest a bit, his weak body still feeling pain. "Where were you?"* - Mon Nov  2 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I was out. - Mon Nov  2 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: You were sleep so I went out for a walk. - Mon Nov  2 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Frowning he'd speak up, "Are you alright?" though pausing and rubbing his now scabbed chest he'd say, "I-I'm sorry for crying so much yesterday. . "* - Mon Nov  2 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I'm fine and no you are okay. - Mon Nov  2 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) says: . . . - Mon Nov  2 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Rubbing his neck a small bit he'd look to the ground, if Hanae had paid any attention, it was like Remy never ate, "I-I'm fine. Not too hungry."* - Mon Nov  2 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Remy... - Mon Nov  2 00:53:45 2015

saying such, he'd take it out and show it to her, "I-I c-can't measure up." putting it back in the box, he'd say, "T-This isn't even close to the naughty things I thought you'd have. . .I'm kinda disapointed" saying such though, still upset about the 'size' thing, he'd walk to the shower, now needing to clear his head.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking away, he'd simply shake his head, "I won't let that happen." saying such, thinking that they were off the topic of sticking it inside of him, he'd quickly try to bend over and get the towel before she had a chace to do anything.* - Mon Nov  2 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) having thought she wouldn't have done anything, he'd suddenly feel her finger inside of him, letting out a small moan, he'd literally fall to the floor on his stomach, surprise having cause his legs to give out.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her finger back in him, now moving around, he'd let out a small cry of sound again ,"S-Stop H-Hanae, t-take it out!" saying such, he'd grasp around for anything to pull away from her, yet would find nothing.* - Mon Nov  2 02:30:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Actually freaked out a small bit now, he'd wiggle, trying to get free, H-Hanae, w-what are you doing?" being moved around like a doll, unable to break free from what she was doing, though his breathing would pick up as he started to panic a small bit.* - Mon Nov  2 02:37:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I wont do it but you need to apologize to me..Apologize for breaking your word. - Mon Nov  2 02:48:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her, he'd grab it, knowing she was upset about it. Saddened by this, he'd look to her, gulping as he started to tear up, tears about to go down his face.

Moving to lay across the bed, with his ass right in front of her he'd say, "H-Hey H-Hanae, l-look, this is for you." saying such, he'd take the dildo and start to prod his own ass with it, causing him to tear up even more, as he really didn't want to do it.* - Mon Nov  2 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Watching it be thrown to the floor, he'd get up, going to grab it, "I-I won't go back on my word." saying such, he'd simply, right there in the floor, start to put it in himself, crying out in discomfort and pain, "I-It hurts!!" being that nothing ever went up there, and with as little as he ate, nothing big ever came out, though, he'd still force himself to take it in.* - Mon Nov  2 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her, water already having been in his eyes, he'd lie blankly, "I-I want to do it. It's what you like. So I want it. . .so, stick it in me Hanae." saying this lie, he'd simply mumble, "I-I love you too, that's why I can do this." saying such he'd move to kiss her lightly, "J-Just grab it before I chicken out."* - Mon Nov  2 03:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her sadly, he'd say, "H-How am I going to keep my word now?" saying such, he'd scaredly run his own fingers to his ass, "I-I'll just have to i-improvise then." intending to use his own fingers and hand if needed. 

"I-I told you I'd do it, and I feel like you won't trust my word anymore if I don't."* - Mon Nov  2 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her he'd say, "I-I know you weren't joking." ignoring the kunai completely. Watching as she went to get in the shower, he was still determind. He knew he wouldn't be able to fix what he had just messed up by refusing her, and thus he'd say, "Y-You get a shower, I'll get more used to. . .taking things." saying such he'd start to rub himself with his fingers, hating it. "G-Gah." letting out a noise as he did so.

"I-I want to be able to be as naughty as you. . .I-I don't want you going to other people." apparently this was a big worry with Remy as he had a weak body to start with. Causing him to think about it a lot.* - Mon Nov  2 03:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) would slowly move back to the bed, laying on his stomach and raising his butt a small bit, "T-Try now. . .before I change my mind." blushing a bit now that the bigger toy was gone, he felt he could start to adjust to this.* - Mon Nov  2 03:34:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) feeling her hands on his ass, he'd be conused, he thought she was going to use something, though, as he felt her rough grip, his upper half would fall to the bed, "O-Ow." as every part of his body could easily be hurt. Though, then feeling her tongue, he'd moan just a tad, biting the sheets infront of himself to stop it. "W-ha-"* - Mon Nov  2 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her tongue again he'd simply get out, "Y-You don't have to do that. . .just something small. . ." saying such, he'd let out another small, girly moan into the sheets. His ass being gripped causing him pain at the same time.* - Mon Nov  2 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Shaking his head as he saw her using the pillow he'd say, "I-I'm sorry. . .I-I know I'm not worth having any of me in your mouth." saying such seriously, and not even kidding about it, as he felt he wasn't worthy for -any- part of him to be in her mouth. Though, not being able to think about it as her finger suddenly went in.

Falling completely down to the bed, moaning again, he'd say, "T-This isn't bad, but I-its not as good as my other thing." as if on que, he'd start to harden up a bit.* - Mon Nov  2 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Looking to her he'd say, "W-What about wanting to use something on me up there. . .I-I mean it wasn't bad. . ." looking to her he'd shake his head, "I-I hurt you enough last time. . .I-I'll let you use any of it on me though. . .j-just watch the collar. . .the skin on my neck itsn't that strong."* - Mon Nov  2 03:59:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Laying back he'd look to her, rubbing his legs together nervously, "P-Please don't do anything permenant. . .I-I do get hurt easy." saying such, blushing and looking away, he'd bascially be fully hard now.* - Mon Nov  2 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling the clamps on him, he'd grit his teeth together, pain coursing threw him, grasping at the bed sheets to try and find something to grab onto, "H-Hanae, I- I know you like giving me pain, b-but you really might have to carry me again after this." saying such, he'd feel her slide down onto him, causing him to moan out again.

Though, feeling the rotation of her hips, he'd try to thrust, even a small bit, as he was already going mad.* - Mon Nov  2 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her move around, and tease him, he'd say, "T-To good." though, as he felt like he was going to cum, he wouldn't be able too, only causing him more pain, as it built up, making him a bit bigger, and causing to to pulse some, Moaning at this he'd say, "W-What!?" as he threw his head back a bit, mouth hanging open.* - Mon Nov  2 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her changing things up, the pain he was feeling from the clips would still be present, though, he'd be feeling just as much pleasure, causing him to be confused, "I-I don't know. N-Not until you're ready." saying such, even though he was in pain, he'd moan out again loudly, feeling her tighten.  His face in the look of a lustful girl, he'd have his tongue hanging out of his mouth, "Sho Ghood." moaning once more, anyone around likely hearing it.* - Mon Nov  2 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her kiss him, his tongue kind of useless in her mouth, he'd feel her tighten up even more, and then, the juices with it, it would drive him over the edge. Trying to cum again, he'd trust his hips, though, it would of course get caught behind the band, causing -extreme- pain for him, causing him to scream a bit into her mouth. 

Clawing at her legs, literally digging his fingers into her, trying to get past the pain he was feeling, he'd likely draw blood.* - Mon Nov  2 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Hearing her, his face would twist in pain, and pleasure, it was a battle between which was stronger. Though, as he laid there, his hands would have a death grip on Hanae's, squeezing probably the hardest he ever had.

"P-Pain." getting that one word out as his head kinda went limp back into the pillow, he'd make small attempts to thrust into her, though his body being a bit overloaded, and unable to respond, he'd likely stop after a few, unable to move.* - Mon Nov  2 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her start to slide off, he'd again cum right then and there, it building up, -again- causing even more pain. Grunting out now, he'd say, "I-I don't think I can." saying such though, he'd force himself above her, the pain in his body being too much for him to handle. Trying to rush, he'd miss lining it up a few times, only to finally shove it in as hard as he could, ignoring the clamps on him now as the pain was so much it was numbing.

Quickly starting to thrust, it was likely that if he came again, the band would explode off.* - Mon Nov  2 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling the clamps beings twisted, he'd almost stop from the pain, unable to take it, though the pain building up down below, he'd be forced to ignore it, though feeling releaved when they finally slipped off, removing the pain he felt, though of course he still have the one(s) on his balls.

Hearing her speak, he'd struggle to go on, though, feeling her tighten up around him, and feeling the juices spray and cover him, he'd find himself about to burst again, though, afraid of that pain, he'd just start thrusting a bit faster, trying to ignore it. Though, as it hit, the band would break, causing everything that he had built up, along with this one to slam forward with a good amount of force into Hanae.* - Mon Nov  2 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) looking to her he'd say, "A-Anything for you." collasping on top of her again, the clamp still on his balls, he'd be motionless, the pain had literally driven him to the point that he had passed out after cumming.* - Mon Nov  2 05:19:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Slowly coming to his senses, he'd -somewhat- wake up, just long enough to remove the clamp from his balls, and roll off of Hanae, his body repeating the pain it had the first time they had done this stuff.* - Mon Nov  2 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her hand, he'd somewhat come to his senses, "W-What are you doing? I-It still hurts. . ." saying such as a small more bit of cum came out of the tip, and his head slammed back into the pillow, "I-I d-don't know if my body can keep up. . .I-I'm sorry."* - Mon Nov  2 05:45:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Watching her, he'd start to harden up again, which would cause him even more pain, opening his mouth to protest, only air would come out as the pain and pleasure mix again took all the words out of his mouth. * - Mon Nov  2 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Feeling her hand on his stomach, he'd try to lift on of his own to rest it on top of hers, "I-I love you too." saying such he'd blush pure red before the pain/pleasure mixture hit when she went back to work.

Feeling her tongue working, and then her taking one of his balls into her mourh he'd say, "I-I don't think I'm going to be able to  move after today." refering to actual movement, and to his member.* - Mon Nov  2 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Remy(SS2015) Blushing heavily he'd say, "I-I'm fine with not being able to move. . .I-It felt good." saying such, a bit sad she had stopped, even if he was hurting he'd attempt to tuck into Hanae, cuddling against her. Of course, he'd try not to let his member hit her.* - Mon Nov  2 06:00:57 2015
