"You know you love it, even if you try to deny it." saying such, if she were to look back to him, he'd smirk playfully and stick his tongue out at her.* - Fri Nov 13 04:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Nodding, he'd get to his knees, taking the rubber. Quickly opening it and sliding it over himself, he'd look to Nari, "Tell me how it feels, and if I need to slow, or stop." 

Lining himself up with her back hole, he'd grab her ass, slowly inserting himself into her, felling an amazingly tight pressure, "O-Oh god."* - Fri Nov 13 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing her, he'd stop however far in he had made it.

"Are you alright?"* - Fri Nov 13 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: I-it hurts - Fri Nov 13 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: I-i cant do it. - Fri Nov 13 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: J-Just give it a shot. - Fri Nov 13 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: F-fine.. - Fri Nov 13 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to her, he'd again reach out for one of her hands, "Just hold on." as he said such, he'd again attempt to keep sliding into her, the pressure causing him more pleasure than he thought it would.

"I-I didn't realize how lucky I was."* - Fri Nov 13 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Letting her squeeze his hand as much as she wanted, he'd slide the rest of the way into her, "I-I'm all the way in. . .I won't move until you say so." saying such, he'd stay where he was, already having a hard time not losing himself into her.* - Fri Nov 13 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking down to her, he'd say, "L-Let's just give you time to get used to it. . .R-Remember, you didn't like licking me either." 

Nodding to himself, he'd slowly pull out, thrusting back in, going at a snails pace. It should be noted, the condom was lubed, so it would likely help some.

"I-I'm sorry, I'll make it up to you."* - Fri Nov 13 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Watching her he'd say, "You're such a good girl~" saying such, he'd continue to move slowly, making sure that he didn't pick up his speed until she was ready. "Y-You're too tight." saying such, he'd of course continue, but was having a hard time going about it.* - Fri Nov 13 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to her he'd say, "B-But we don't have anything to help. . ." though pausing he'd come up with an idea, even if it didn't work. Pulling out a bit, he'd say, "I-I could use my spit. . ." saying such, he'd look around, "U-Unless we have something else."

Though as he spoke he'd reach down, trying to rub her himself, "O-Or perhaps I can use your own juices? I-I don't know. . ." obviously being completely clueless, he'd continue to thrust slowly.* - Fri Nov 13 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Nodding a bit, he'd pull out slightly, leaning down, he'd let let his spit fall out of his mouth. Rubbing it all over the condom, and on the outside of her hole a bit, he'd slowly start to push it back in, it obviously being easier now.

"S-So tight." saying such, he'd continue to thrust, just a bit faster now.* - Fri Nov 13 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing her, he'd say, "I-I'm about to." saying such, he'd pick up speed, not keeping it slow anymore. He couldn't help it. Thrusting as fast as he could, he'd grab onto her hips, "I-I'm sorry."

As he said this, he'd thrust in one last time, hard. Once he did so, he'd come hard into the condom, filling it up.* - Fri Nov 13 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing her scream, he'd feel bad. Looking down to her hole, he'd stick his finger in it, teasing her some more, "S-Sorry. . .did it feel good at all?" saying such, he'd continue to wiggle his finger around. 

Looking down to his condom, filled up, "W-What do I do with that?" saying such, he'd continue to tease her.* - Fri Nov 13 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: s-stop it.. - Fri Nov 13 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Pretending to look away, he'd of course be watching the entire time. Watching her drink his cum, he'd almost get fully hard again, that having been one of the hottest things he'd ever seen, "N-Nari. . .T-That was kinda hot. . ." saying such, he'd look down, "S-Seems my body agrees." having said such, he'd blush, "You seem to know how to push the right buttons. . ."* - Fri Nov 13 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to her, not having expected it, he'd speak out, "Oh god Nari. . .you're such a naughty girl." saying such, he'd pulse even harder, excited by what had just happened. "W-What has gotten into you~ I like it. ." saying such, he'd attempt to reach down and rest his hands on her head, though he wouldn't puch against it, -yet-. 

"God. . ." his face would twist in a bit of pleasure.* - Fri Nov 13 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Moaning out a bit, he wouldn't be able to hold it long, being that he was sensitive from cumming already. Thus, he'd give one slight thrust, suddenly bursting into her mouth, "T-Take it." saying such, he'd spurt out a decent amount considering he had just came before this.

"Y-You're amazing."* - Fri Nov 13 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Moving to wrap his arms around her, his face twisted in lust, as what she had done was probably the best feeling he had ever felt, he'd say, "N-Nari. . .don't hide. . that was amazing. . .I-I want you to do that more. . i-it felt amazing. Y-You don't have to do anymore today. . but it felt too good." 

Pulling her tight to him, it was be obvious that he was more happy than he had been in a long time.* - Fri Nov 13 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: okay.. - Fri Nov 13 06:15:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Sighing slightly, only nodding to Nari, he'd move, going to grab a nearby shovel. He refused to build on sand, which would only shift and in time destroy the house. Thus, looking around the area, he'd plot out a square. Looking it over, he'd nod at such, deciding that it would be more than big enough for a house. Moving to it, he'd begin to shovel the sand and dirt away, doing such for longer than he thought he'd have to. Simply throwing all of it to the side, figuring someone else would pick it up later, he'd eventually hit rock, showing that he was good to move on.

Moving away, finding a few merchants, he'd discuss with them what he should do next. Nodding at their answer, he'd quickly buy a rather large amount of Suna's patented 'sandcrete' cause how the hell else would houses be made of sand? Having a few people help him carry it to the foundation he was working on, he'd quickly pay for a shinobi with a water nature to help him out. Mixing the sandcrete with water, he'd only have a short amount of time to work. Quickly pouring it into the square he had dug out. he'd move it to smooth it all out.

Having done such, he'd then grab a metal rod out of a pile he had asked for while he had buying teh mix. Quickly moving around the foundation, he'd push them into it, forming a grid to work off of. Making it such that the outter frame was done, he'd nod. Though, grabbing a ladder, he'd of course move to shape the rods into the look of every other sunagakure building, with the rounded roof, using brute strength to do such. Having done such, he'd of course move down, taking a break and wiping his brow off. This job was harder than he thought it would be, and he didn't plan to do another one after.

Now, working in another system, he'd use his chain technique to reach out over the drying mix. Quickly sticking more, shorter rods into the mix to that it would be the rough outline of where walls would eventually be. This, being more stressful than he thought it would be, would take rather long, being that he had to continue to stress himself out by using a jutsu. Though, once he was done, he'd of course retract his arm and look it all over. For the time being all it was really, was a mix of concrete and metal, that didn't look like much. Though, to him, it was progress.

Having had to wait for the mix on the foundation to dry, he'd goof off for some bit before coming back. Looking it over, he'd nod, having come back with another large batch of the mix. Again mixing it with water, he'd move to start to plaster it to the bars, being that this was a different mix, meant to be more sticky, and stay on the bars. Moving all the way around the house, he'd go through a rather large amount of it, building up the outside walls of the house. Though, once done, he'd of course move to the inside, making sure to do the same to all of those walls. 

Smoothing all of it out, he'd wipe his head a bit, looking up to the open area above him. He knew he had to get that done next before any sort of weather started up. Thus, moving outside, he'd start to do what he had on the walls, though of course he'd now be on a ladder, again using his chain technique to stretch out and plaster it all onto the roof. Taking his time as he went, he'd then move inside, making sure to get all of the ceiling in there as well, again smoothing it all out so that it wouldn't look trashy.

Nodding to himself, he could only think of one more thing left to do. Quickly leaving, again talking to the merchants, he'd aquire a rather large amount of wood. Making his way back, he'd move to position a portion of it as a floor, putting down piece after peace so that whoever lived there wouldn't have to walk in the sand and dirt that they would likely bring it, and would have an easier time sweeping it throughout the house. Moving on, he'd quickly place windows, and a wooden door, leaving it all perfect, simply lacking supplies for the actual house, "Done. Whoever moves in just has to buy their own stuff now.* - Fri Nov 13 19:08:09 2015
