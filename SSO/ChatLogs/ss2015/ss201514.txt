<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Now - Tue Nov 17 07:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Do... I remove her cloths for her? No... I will ask the nurses... - Tue Nov 17 07:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: I dont know... I DID piss the off last week... hmmmm what to do... - Tue Nov 17 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) having arrived at the hospital, and been directed to this room, being that the staff had seem him with Kiyoko rather much now, he'd move tot knock on the door first, before trying to open it. 

If he could get the door to be opened, he'd glance around looking for Kiyoko, for once in a long time -real- worry on his face. If he saw her, it would be likely he'd panic, thinking that he'd be about to lose someone else. Though, he'd contain this.

If he was blocked by Bryson, he'd simply try to convince him to let him see Kiyoko. 

Regardless, he'd look to Marrisa, "I -will- see Koyoko first. . .She is the closest thing to family I have left."* - Tue Nov 17 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: LEt me explain this again. Move. When a Jonunin gives a Genin an order, they follow it. Not to mention, I am supposed to be doing my job, and can't do that if you won't move.  - Tue Nov 17 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) thinks: Let him rage. . I am -NOT- Remotly in the mood. . Kiyoko DID just bassicly kill my little sister . You'd think people would have more fucking respect - Tue Nov 17 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: I killed my entire family and everyone who cared for me without being able to stop myself. I won't let something happen to Kiyoko too. - Tue Nov 17 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You will both vacate once this conversation is done.  - Tue Nov 17 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I will not leave this room - Tue Nov 17 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I have one last thing that needs done before I can clear Miss Nakano from this.  - Tue Nov 17 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having been let in, he'd glare back to Marrisa. "I won't be leaving her side, she is all I have left. I will sit quietly in the room, but I refuse to leave. If that is an issue, take it up with the Kazekage." saying such, he'd move into the room, worry written all over the boy's face.

His usal dark aura hidden away for now he'd look down to her, "You went and got yourself in a bad situation again didn't you?" It was obvious that in his current state that if anyone made a move towards Kiyoko with ill intent, he'd likely try and rip their head off.* - Tue Nov 17 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: *pulls out the blunt marrisa gave him...* "What was that?" - Tue Nov 17 07:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to Kiyoko, ignoring anything going on with Bryson and Marrisa, other than what she said about leaving, he'd turn aound slightly, "As I said, I am fine with not saying, or doing anything, but I won't be leaving her."

Turning back to Kiyoko, reaching down, wiping the tears away from her face, he'd give a small smile, quoting her first words to him, "No more tears." it was obvious that Aza was deeply worried.* - Tue Nov 17 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Man, everyone wants to see me nakey. - Tue Nov 17 08:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to Kiyoko, he'd finish wiping whatever tears he could, "Once she is done, I'll be back in here. I want a full explanation, alright?" saying such, he'd move to walk to the exit, turning once he got there.

Looking back to Kiyoko, he'd smile a bit, "I'll be in the hall. Yell if you need me." saying such, he'd move to wait just by the door.* - Tue Nov 17 08:29:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Knocking, eventually walking in, carrying bag, he'd walk over to the table. Setting it down, he'd pull out a container in which all the food would be contained, "They said it was a mean inspired by things from over-seas. Perhaps you'll like it." saying such, he'd open the container.

Resting a hand on her shoulder he'd say, "Everything will be alright. . ."* - Tue Nov 17 10:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd shrug, feeling he couldn't do anything more. Leaning back, he'd close his eyes slightly, "I'm sorry to say, but when Lera isn't around, I might have to pull a Bryson and be protective of you." this being a joke, he'd smirk at her a bit, still doing his best to cheer her up.* - Tue Nov 17 10:31:53 2015
