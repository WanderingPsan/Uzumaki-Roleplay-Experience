<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: He's like the biggest test ever. - Mon Nov 16 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: These two were enjoying their 'alone' time. - Mon Nov 16 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .... - Mon Nov 16 06:18:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: It's okay Mit. We don't want to ruin the atmosphere. - Mon Nov 16 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Was obviously teasing now.* - Mon Nov 16 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: R-right, atmosphere...heh. - Mon Nov 16 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You killed your family, stupid ass motherfucker. - Mon Nov 16 06:20:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to Yan, as if the comment hadn't even phased him, he'd tilt his head a bit, a curious, "And?"* - Mon Nov 16 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Chuckling slightly he'd look to Yan, saying such unusually cheery, "What? Sake got you tongue?"* - Mon Nov 16 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: What's going oooon. - Mon Nov 16 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: He's doing pretty well... - Mon Nov 16 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess you aren't as sensitive as before. - Mon Nov 16 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: He doesn't go boom anymore? - Mon Nov 16 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Last time I said that, you did that little transformation you do. - Mon Nov 16 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I told you, Aza!  - Mon Nov 16 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I helped! - Mon Nov 16 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Is the test so he doesn't die in a month? - Mon Nov 16 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Uhoh. - Mon Nov 16 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Who's Nari? - Mon Nov 16 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: His girlfreind. - Mon Nov 16 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to Mitunsara, his face would turn to one of apathy before suddenly changing back to a smile, "Nari left me. And the village." keeping his smile on, he'd look to Ivel, "C'mere Ivel." saying such, he'd look to the boy, waiting for him to approach.* - Mon Nov 16 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...ex...girlfriend. - Mon Nov 16 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Uh apparently...she isn't a shinobi. - Mon Nov 16 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... Eh? - Mon Nov 16 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: The fuck? - Mon Nov 16 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah I was surprised to. - Mon Nov 16 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to Ivel, he'd reach out, patting him on the head, "I don't care about her anymore, and, thank you for helping me~" saying such happily, he'd move to look to Mit, "If you keep talking like that Mitsunara, I may have to make you show me what I should consider a good taste in chicks." chuckling at his own sense of humor he'd simply say, "I don't really care about her anymore."

Which was somewhat far off, though, no one could know that.* - Mon Nov 16 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Cool. - Mon Nov 16 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I helped. - Mon Nov 16 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I knew I was helpful. - Mon Nov 16 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: *nods* - Mon Nov 16 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Yan. - Mon Nov 16 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: You date Mitsunara sauce? - Mon Nov 16 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..I think you are over doing it... - Mon Nov 16 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Man, Mitsunara can be really mean... - Mon Nov 16 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Damn straight, lil homie. - Mon Nov 16 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to Mitsunara, he'd fake a look of being hurt, while talking in a cheerful voice, "Oh me, little old me is soooo upset." though, ignoring anything said having to do with fighting he'd simply retort, "I'm more of a lover than a fighter anyway, if you catch my drift." saying such jokingly, he'd lean back against the wall.

Looking her up and down he'd say, "True, True, but she didn't have the same appeal either, she didn't almost end my life with a blade to my throat."* - Mon Nov 16 06:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Mon Nov 16 06:43:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Something wrong Kiyoko?~ - Mon Nov 16 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: N-noooooo. - Mon Nov 16 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: It's weird when he isn't mean. - Mon Nov 16 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: You guys are tripping. - Mon Nov 16 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Right? - Mon Nov 16 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'd have expected him to try and kill me by now, like the mongrel he really is. I guess a dog can learn to hide it's colors. - Mon Nov 16 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Old dogs can't learn new tricks! - Mon Nov 16 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Tell you what. We'll fight after I eat. If you can last a good while without transforming, I say we can give you a good bill of health. - Mon Nov 16 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: How's that sound, Kiyoko-san - Mon Nov 16 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: It just learns to sit on it's belly and lick itself! - Mon Nov 16 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Not gonna lie to ya Mit. - Mon Nov 16 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I'm not much without changing. - Mon Nov 16 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Then I'll go unarmed... and besides. That makes it a good test. I'm sure being beaten around a bit'll piss you off. - Mon Nov 16 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Now, can you give us a fuckin break so me 'n Yan can eat? - Mon Nov 16 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: I thought we were just going to hang out..Oh well. - Mon Nov 16 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Our meal is prolly almost ready by now. - Mon Nov 16 06:47:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So sod off. - Mon Nov 16 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Let me know if you need more time to fuck afterwards too. - Mon Nov 16 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Kiyoko, you seen en-..... - Mon Nov 16 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Bug off, Aza. - Mon Nov 16 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Saying such, he'd laugh, trying to walk off now.* - Mon Nov 16 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Watching the knife fly by his head, he'd look back to Mitsunara, raising an eyebrow. Being that he was sitting originally, it was likely that his hand and arm had been hidden. Thus, he'd suddenly extend it, letting it move like a snake under the table and towards Mitsunara's Chair, aiming for the corner leg, he'd attempt to pull it and break it off.

If this worked he'd say, "I'm just enjoying my day!~"* - Mon Nov 16 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) His hand being slammed down, would take a small bit of pain. Whistling he'd say, "Damn, I bet you'd be good at tap dancing." saying such, he'd retract his hand, "Kiyoko, let's go, I'll help you out with your wedding stuff. 

Though, looking back to Mit he'd say, "Hey, how about have dinner with me next time?~ I need to get back on my feet anyway~" joking, he'd chuckle, it was obvious he had changed.* - Mon Nov 16 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Well Kiyoko~ - Mon Nov 16 07:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I'm Sure Yan hates me now. - Mon Nov 16 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You went a little f-far. - Mon Nov 16 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Eh, I consider it payback. - Mon Nov 16 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well... I don't think he will want to train you now. - Mon Nov 16 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Eh, I'll find someone else. - Mon Nov 16 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Tetsumi might not mind training me. - Mon Nov 16 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Surprised Bryson hasn't said anything to me... after all I'm walking, no bruises, no crazy talk, just stitches.... and we argued last time we saw each other. - Mon Nov 16 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hey, that's true. - Mon Nov 16 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Plus I was just messing. - Mon Nov 16 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: After alll, Nari's gone. . .I'm trying to move on and get over it. - Mon Nov 16 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: So I teased Mitsun a bit. . .which she probably isn't happy about either. - Mon Nov 16 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm glad you are doing so well, Aza. - Mon Nov 16 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Tis but life. - Mon Nov 16 07:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Anyway you should just have to worry about the temple. - Mon Nov 16 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I will, I keep in constant contact with the temple about my developments...  They kinda just gave me the title becasue I was the only useful "medic" here... No one  really focused on healing as medic... I was alittle disappointed - Mon Nov 16 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right. - Mon Nov 16 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well I focus on all the good medic stuff. - Mon Nov 16 07:38:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: How do you feel about people? - Mon Nov 16 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd raise an eyebrow, continuing the question, "And how about the death of people?"

Asking such, he'd lean back into his chair, a apathetic look on his face, added with some bags under his eyes as if he hadn't slept the night before.* - Mon Nov 16 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Nodding slightly he'd say, "Well then, can you keep a secret then? One that would cause my death if it got out?" asking such, it would be likely she'd feel the aura coming from his body, showing that what was likely to be said was something dark.* - Mon Nov 16 20:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd say, "Nari is dead. She didn't leave me."* - Mon Nov 16 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd say, "She wanted to leave the village. Wanted both of us to go rouge." saying such he'd think a bit more, "Though, it was more than minor annoyance as well, but I'll keep that to myself."

Pausing, saying such, "I was in a rage when it happened, but I remember it clearly." thinking a bit more he'd frown, "Her body was well. . .disposed of." moving on, "Though, I think I broke a bit. I don't really care about much anymore, and I'd be fine to watch most people burn. . ."* - Mon Nov 16 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I wasn't hungry for a reason yesterday. . .Let's simply say the beast wanted to keep Nari around. . . - Mon Nov 16 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ...You killed and ate your girlfreind. - Mon Nov 16 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: You act as if I wanted to. - Mon Nov 16 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Look, all I'm sayin is- don't hit on me, with a track record like that, eh? - Mon Nov 16 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Raising an eyebrow at her, he'd simpy smirk before chuckling, "I simply wanted to show that I'm not as worthless to have a girl drop me. Though, if anything, the way you're handling this makes me want to hit on you more."

Chuckling a bit more he'd move on, "Though, I wouldn't do anything like that to you. You don't annoy me. Plus, the fact that you can handle me when I'm changed is a bit appealing~" 

Chuckling, it being obvious that his old personality was a bit faded, "What, am I not appealing to you~?"* - Mon Nov 16 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head he'd simply say, "Honestly, I feel fine. I care less about most things." saying such, he'd look her over, "Could I interest you on a date one day? Or am I now a monster to you as well?"

Asking such, he'd think things over againa and ask seriously, "Or would Yan be upset with me?" his curiousity coming through in his tone. * - Mon Nov 16 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd raise an eyebrow, "Do I look like the kind of guy who wants kids? I don't plan to pass my trait on to more people." saying such, he'd think about what she had said, "Getting married is pointless. Nothing changes." again thinking things over, he'd move on.

"I can't help but try. I find you appealing. That, and I figured perhaps you'd like the same joy I recently found. . .killing isn't something that bothers me. . .I somewhat accepted it." sighing slightly, "Though, no one worth killing. . .I have Kiyoko who is like family keeping me from getting myself in trouble."

Moving on he'd say, "So level with me. I assume no chance at that date? And you're probably going to tell someone about what I did?"* - Mon Nov 16 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly, he'd look to her, his eyes suddenly sad, "I didn't give her up. Things. . .happened. She was going to leave the house and not come back to me the night I killed her. I found scrolls that she had written. Though, I guess I am disgusting." saying such, he'd lean back, any sign of light in his eyes, or happiness on his face gone.

"I lost my love for her. . .She treated me as a guard dog. . .and when it came down to it, she revealed her colors and admited such." sighing slightly, he'd look to her, his face somewhat dead on emotion. "As I said, I didn't think of what I was doing. If I still felt the same as I did before it happened, I'd be crying over it. Though, as I have admitted, I'm a bit broken now. . ."

"As for that duel, I give up now, ahead of time. . .you don't undertstand how weak my body really is without changing. I'm cursed to be an unhappy monster."* - Mon Nov 16 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd say, "I can simply hold it back, or accelerate it to happen. I guess I'm just a bomb. . .send me in and let me go." chuckling he'd look to her.

"So, I can't change your mind about that date?" Saying such before chuckling, he'd again lean back.

"As long as you don't use me, like everyone but Kiyoko has, you don't have to be worried. Plus, I still feel bad for your ribs."* - Mon Nov 16 21:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh.... I don't mind bein freind's. But I'm just not so interested in dating. - Mon Nov 16 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Hmph. A shame. - Mon Nov 16 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I rather like you. And you seem to protect Kiyoko. - Mon Nov 16 21:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Well, allow me to make you an offer? - Mon Nov 16 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Shoot. - Mon Nov 16 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to her he'd say, "Attempt to date me for a bit, a trial run per say." saying such, he'd look to her, his hands now in his pockets, "Though, I guess if you really don't want to, I understand." being that he knew what he was, and what he had done, he was sure that she would turn him down no matter what he did. 

"I am but a monster anyway." his eyes, a bit blank would scan around. "Though, it would allow me to trust you a bit more."* - Mon Nov 16 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to her he'd say, "If you don't care, and I don't care about almost anything at this point, I don't see why it won't work out. Seems like a good match to me." saying such, he'd finally let a smile come across his lips.

"Plus, if we did, I'm sure Kiyoko would be brimming with happiness."* - Mon Nov 16 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Chuckling a bit he'd look to her, "Tonight? Sounds fine to me. What do you suggest we do~?" asking such teasingly, he'd chuckle.

"I'd say we'd go kill something together, but that seems a bit much, and we're in Suna, so we can't exactly do such anyway." saying such, he'd shake his head, it was likely that Mitsun would be unable to tell if what he had said was a joke or not.* - Mon Nov 16 21:49:52 2015
