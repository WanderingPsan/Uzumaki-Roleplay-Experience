<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Chuckling in quite a creepy way as he was already in the door way of the house as all the commotion was going on outside. His frame taking in the view of everything around him. The sight of all the people who had come to seemingly get in his way of his lust for blood, and need to release his anger, it would in turn do the worst possible thing to him. It would raise his anger even more, letting the marks on his body to start to consume him again like it had the day before, coating his skin.

His hair getting a bit longer, and a few other weird additions, such as tubes on his back and so on. Roaring out now, his voice now being high pitch, he'd lock his eyes on Marrisa. His arm suddenly changing shape, he'd launch it forward, attempting to wrap around her and pull her towards him.* - Tue Nov 10 21:57:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Still in a rage, unable to control his actions, and having his arm still outstretched, he'd suddenly be barraged with multiple things at once. Wires first wrapping around his one arm and body, and another around his legs. Though, this not bothering him while he had one arm out, he'd screech out a blood curtling sound.

While his arm was suddenly grabbed, and a large amount of iron sand covered him as well, he'd still be fine though in his murderuous mind, he still had his arm near the girl who had grabbed it. Thus, he'd stretch it further, moving to wrap it around her arms, and eventually up to her throat, doing his best to strangle the life out of her.

He'd likely continue to try until his arm was let go, or he was again knocked out.* - Tue Nov 10 22:36:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Being trapped inside of a dome of sand, unable to see any viable target anymore, his anger would subside, his will to continue to fight dying along with this anger, and blood lust. His body, slowly turning back to normal, would be left largely undamaged, though sore. 

Mentally, he'd be broken, realizing what had happened. While he was one for violence sometimes, being unable to control what had come over him was upsetting. Though, this being one of the biggest incidents of it, it would leave him tired, his body not wanting to respond, his face blank, along with his eyes. 

He wouldn't fight back against the sand around him, he wouldn't cry, he wouldn't even be angry. He'd be lacking of anything as he was hidden inside of the dome, lost inside of his own thought and emotional issues.* - Tue Nov 10 23:26:17 2015

His other hand would of course be wrapped around her ass, squeezing it.

Though as she crossed her legs more, he'd keep his hand in place, rubbing her a tad faster, "L-Let's do it then." saying such, as it was a loop hole around what she had said, he'd move back to attempt to lick her nipple again.

Only breaking away after a bit more licking he'd say, "I know it feels good for you." though, blushing heavily, he actually had no clue, he only knew what he had seen in the books.* - Wed Nov 11 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to her a bit embarrassed he'd say, "T-Then can we do something else I saw in a book?" saying such in an embarrassed manor he'd go on to say, "I-I really want to do it with you though. . .W-Why can't we?" saying such, he'd stop rubbing her, but he'd have his hand still planted firmly in the area, not moving it until the conversation was done.* - Wed Nov 11 05:46:52 2015

If she let him in, he'd try to comfort her and ask what was wrong, saying, "Y-You didn't have to run away over it."

If she didn't, he'd forcefully break it open, breaking the look on the door, and saying the same thing as previously mentioned.* - Wed Nov 11 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having opened the door open at this point, he'd catch sight of whatever she was doing.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Watching her remove all of her clothes, he'd be rock hard, ready to burst a bit. "N-Nari." saying such, he'd remove his own clothing, showing his fully erect member, and toned, yet scard body, "I-I love you so much N-Nari. . L-Let me help you get clean." saying such, he'd move to turn the shower on for her.

"I-I'll wash your back for you."* - Wed Nov 11 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Walking into the shower, and grabbing some liquid soap, he'd put it all over her back, rubbing the upper half of her seductively, from her should down her spine to the middle of her back, though, as he started to get slower, he'd move closer, his hard member rubbing into her back.

"Oops. . .looks like it wants to help get you clean." saying such, he'd rub himself against her as his hands worked on her upper back.* - Wed Nov 11 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Watching as her ass popped out in his direction, he'd bite his lip, lining himself up at the entrance of her folds, bloodied or not, and holding her hips rather tightly, "N-Nari. . .P-Please?" saying such, one of his two hands would run from her ass up towards her shoulder, then coming back down to rest on her hip.

His right had a bit towards her other hole, he'd try something else he saw in his book, lightly using his his fingers to play with it. "B-Baby?" * - Wed Nov 11 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Saddened a bit he'd simply shake his head, "I-It's not that. I want to be connected with you. . .I wanna commit everything I have to you." saying such, he'd moan a bit as she rubbed him, though he was clearly willing himself not to cum, doing everything in his power to keep his calm.

"N-Nari. . .D-Don't you love me?" saying such, he'd frown slightly. Though, even as his said this, his eyes would stare at her breast rather much before going to her face. He really wanted to do this with her before something else happened to him, "W-What if something happens while you're asleep? I-I might be jailed or killed." saying such looking to her, he'd suddenly feel even more pleasure, suddenly falling to the floor in the shower, letting out a gasp. 

Grabbing her hand, making her stop he'd say, "P-Please Nari? I-I want you to take my virginity."* - Wed Nov 11 06:50:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Saying such, he'd blush heavily, looking away from her.* - Wed Nov 11 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking at her, staring a bit he'd say, "D-Do you just wanna do it here?" saying such, he'd move to be in front of her, getting on his knees to be level with her. Lightly moving her hands away from her face, he'd move to kiss her, "S-Should I try and start?"* - Wed Nov 11 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Nodding to her, he'd line himself up, not moving to put it in yet. Reaching his hand out to her he'd say, "T-Take my hand. . .I-I've read that the first time hurts. . .s-so squeeze my hand as much as you need, and tell me to stop it it's too much." saying such, he'd start to move himself into her.

Going as a snails pace, he'd move his way into her, eventually breaking her hymen if she actually was a virgin. Though, of course he'd stop at any sign of Nari in pain, he cared more about her than his own pleasure.

Though, of course durning all of this, a loving look would be on his face, and a fondness as well as he looked to her. His hardened body, covered in scars, would of course be in her sight as water ran down him.* - Wed Nov 11 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Holding her hand the entire time, he'd find himself sliding all the way into her, her walls too tight to even describe, "N-Nari. . Y-You feel so good." saying such, he'd slowly start to pull his hips back away, pulling out of her a bit, and then of course slowly moving himself back in, not wanting to hurt her.

Doing this, trying to distract her from the pain, he'd lean forward to kiss her, his other hand supporting himself so he didn't put any weight on her.

"I-I'm glad I could be your first, and you mine Nari. . .I-I want to be around for you forever." a bit lost in the moment, he'd almost tear up from happiness, though, he'd of course blink it away, not wanting to seem mushy infront of her.* - Wed Nov 11 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) feeling her nails in his back, he'd grint a bit. Quickly feeling her tighten, he'd be on the edge. Not even thinking about it until it was almost too late, he'd pull out, releasing himself onto the floor, and some of it on her.

"N-Nari. . ." quickly moving to clean himself up, and then her, he'd grab them both towels and robes, helping her clean off.

Once this was all said and done, he'd walk out to check the door, if someone was still knocking.* - Wed Nov 11 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Notes, he'd carry Nari out bride style.* - Wed Nov 11 07:29:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having come out to quite a sight, being that Kiyoko was in a wheel chair, and pretty messed up, he'd turn on a dime, his mind racing at the fact that he could have been the only one who could have done that. This, combined with past memories, he'd make a sign as if he was going to throw up. 

Quickly pushing Nari back and to the side, he'd rush back into the house, leaving the door open as he ran to the trashcan to puke. He knew he had done something terrible from the sight of his house, be he wouldn't have guessed he'd have done something such as that. He was sickened with himself now, so as he finished his date with the trashcan, he'd find himself curled up like a ball in front of it, not even having responded to Kiyoko.* - Wed Nov 11 07:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: It was that monster...just that rage..I'm sure you wouldn't hurt someone like that on yo u own will. - Wed Nov 11 07:56:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) catching sight of Kiyoko again, he'd once more have his eyes go wide, causing him to lean over and heave into the trashcan again, though, already having emptied himself out, he'd simply be dry heaving. 

Once he was done, he'd slowly stumble to the couch, which was now held together with a few pieces of wood. Sitting, he would have avoided looking at Kiyoko, and wouldn't speak out to her either.* - Wed Nov 11 08:03:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head, the mixture of all the talking, and the thoughts going through his head, he'd come to the mental conclusion, the he in turn was a monster. His morals that he normally had were simply a cover, why else would he turn into such a murderous beast when he got stonger. To him, it only made sense that it had to be his true feelings showing.

Though, all do the talking getting to him more and more, he'd stand, abruptly moving to walk to the bedroom. "I've come to a conclusion, I'm a monster, no way around it." upon saying such, he'd make his way through the bedroom door, and would walk towards the bed.

Once there, he'd force himself to breathe rather deeply. While he agreed he was a monster, and dangerous, he didn't need to continuously hear it from people in his own house. (*Cough* Sanoke)* - Wed Nov 11 08:12:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Sighing, sucking up any form of discomfort, anger, or annoyance, he'd step towards Kiyoko.
