<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: This lady is trying to move and disrupt the seen. The seen hasn't even been inspected for clues or evidence. And she's trying to carelessly contaminate the scene. - Sun Nov 15 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: scene* - Sun Nov 15 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, this isn't the proper scene. The body was already moved. - Sun Nov 15 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I am not trying to move and disrupt the scene, I'm trying to take it for an autopsy which is my job, and I have a right to it. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Exactly! - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: There can still be evidence - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And it's getting further and further contaminated. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: What a terrible doctor..... - Sun Nov 15 02:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Kuro I have the authority to take this body to give it an autopsy, if you really must know where I have been I was at the hospital doing my -shift-. - Sun Nov 15 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You know I couldn't have done this because you saw my condition I have been in for a few weeks now. - Sun Nov 15 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: This deceased man is a stranger, I haven't even seen him until I walked up twenty minutes ago to take the body in for autopsy. - Sun Nov 15 02:57:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: That redhead with the Chakrams dragged the body down here to show it to everyone, from a bit up north by the wall. - Sun Nov 15 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Did you guys find anything else about the woman we are searching for? - Sun Nov 15 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Have you questioned the red head? Who drags a body to show it to people? Wouldn't you bring the people to the body? She likely contaminated it a great amount in doing that. - Sun Nov 15 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: It was a male that found it I thought? - Sun Nov 15 03:01:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to Kiyoko he'd simply say, "I'm strong enough to carry it if you want Kiyoko."* - Sun Nov 15 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright but I need it picked straight up and onto the bag. So I need someone else to help, Kuro... please? - Sun Nov 15 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Kiyoko. . .I can do it myself. . . - Sun Nov 15 03:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Two people. Just please come put the gloves on? - Sun Nov 15 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: I guess I shouldn't inform her of being able to use Chain without turning now then. - Sun Nov 15 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: I could pick it up with -that- but It would creep people out - Sun Nov 15 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) would simply shake his head, moving forward and taking the gloves from Kiyoko. Once he had them on, he'd grab at the body's legs, looking to Kuro, waiting for the man to help him out being that Kiyoko seemed so set on it.* - Sun Nov 15 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: So Kuro isn't a police officer yet this Aoi girl thought that she would listen to him and I didn't have the authority to know who told her to stand here. - Sun Nov 15 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Annoying. - Sun Nov 15 03:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Just pick up the body together straight up and then set it down into the bag and zip it up, if you have other things to do, Aza can carry the body easily enough. - Sun Nov 15 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looks to Kuro, nodding to lift the body up. Once he was sure the boy was ready,he'd lift the legs, aiming to move it down into the bag. Once the body had been set down, unless Kuro had other plans, he'd move to zip the bag up, and carry it in his arms like it was a pillow.* - Sun Nov 15 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right, thank you for your help Kuro. - Sun Nov 15 03:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: When you're done with the autopsy, I wish to cremate him and bring him back to Kumogakure to bury with the rest of my friends and allies. - Sun Nov 15 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see, you probably won't be allowed to do that until after the murderer is caught though. - Sun Nov 15 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Due to if we need to go back for a second autopsy. - Sun Nov 15 03:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd mumble, "Must be nice to be able to simply take things. . ." though trailing off, he'd lean back, listening to the music, only really nodding to what Kiyoko would say. Once he had caught onto the music he'd start to hum a bit with it, trying to memorize the sounds of it.

Once she asked if he had understood, he'd finally speak out once more, "Sure, sure. Just. . .if it goes too far, I will leave myself." saying such more as a precaution than a threat or such, he'd go back to humming.* - Sun Nov 15 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Sighing slightly, he'd simply nod to her statement about the panic button. Then, hearing her question, he'd seriously have to think upon it. Though, once he realized what the first memory he had of it, he'd have his facial features twist into one of disguist, and panic. 

Reeling it back in, he'd rub his face, trying to calm himself enough to answer the question, "When I was a child. . .with my family."* - Sun Nov 15 06:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing her question, he'd suddenly become hesitant, looking away as he didn't want to get into the subject about his family or what had happened to them, "P-Pass."* - Sun Nov 15 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head a bit he'd simply say, "Control? At best I can try and stop it. . .once it happens, I don't even remember what happened. . .but no. I can't think of another time." saying such he'd pause a bit, looking around the room.

"I can do this now though. . ." saying such, he'd raise his arm forward, looking to Kiyoko's head. Suddenly extending his arm, much like he would have when he was transformed, he'd softly pat her on the head. "So I assume I am making some progress over it."* - Sun Nov 15 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly he would say, "I guess I should have warned you before hand huh?" though listening to her make a few lame jokes, he'd shake his head, "Don't quit being a nurse, you wouldn't make it as a comedian." saying such though, he'd try to hide a small smirk, as he had enjoyed her attempt. "Of course I enjoy it. . .as you said, it can come in 'handy' and. . .it means progress. . .right?" 

Even as he asked such, he'd frown a bit, a small part of him thought that perhaps it just meant that the beast in him was simply preparing his body to fully take over forever.* - Sun Nov 15 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head slightly, he'd quickly come up with a bad lie, "O-Oh ah, nothing, was just thinking of more jokes. . .like how ah, that medical treatment must have cost you an 'arm' .  . ." knowing it was a bad lie, he'd turn to look away.* - Sun Nov 15 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head, smiling stupidly, he'd look to her, "After she was around for a while. . .I just felt. . .calm. I can't exactly explain."* - Sun Nov 15 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Sighing slightly, he'd speak, "It was just a little while. . .we started to click, and I felt calm. . ." thought looking to the side, he'd mumble, "Though lately I'm starting to feel like we're drifting a part. . "* - Sun Nov 15 07:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head rather much he'd say, "I wasn't watching. . .I'm still not meant too. . .but I heard a lot of people. . .and loud noises. . .I knew it couldn't have been good." saying such, he'd shrug saying, "What I caught didn't do anything to me. . .Though, maybe if I had actually seen it all it might have. I was too worried about getting you. . "* - Sun Nov 15 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to her, knowing full well that everytime he did, likely forever he'd think that it was his fault for what had happened to her. Speaking in a low tone, indicating that this particular question bothered him he'd say, "Pass. . ."* - Sun Nov 15 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Shaking his head he'd simply say, "Usually, I don't remember anything at all. . .but sometimes when I dream I catch small bits and pieces. . ." saying such, he'd sigh heavily, extremely happy that she had steared clear of his touchier subjects.* - Sun Nov 15 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Should I tell her about Yan finding out about my parents and using it ag- No No. . .don't think about that. - Sun Nov 15 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 15 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: M-Mhm. - Sun Nov 15 07:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking to her he'd simply shake his head, "I'm not done yet. . .I should probably tell you something. . .Do you remember back. . .to what I told you about what I did to my mother?"* - Sun Nov 15 08:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Looking down sadly, as this wasn't something that would trigger him unless it was used against him he'd say, "It was just here. . .I killed my entire family as. . .that thing. Now. . .remember when I told you about Yan and I fighting? That's how he coaxed me into it. . .he made the assumption and I couldn't deny it. . .if other people find out. . ." 

Trailing off he'd look down, sickened with himself.* - Sun Nov 15 08:11:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why? Yan listens to me. - Sun Nov 15 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Just don't worry about it. - Sun Nov 15 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes but think about it.... if I don't say anything and he does this again what if you hurt him or someone else? - Sun Nov 15 08:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: I'm rambling again. . . - Sun Nov 15 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) A sad smile coming across his face, he'd reach forward, holding out his own, though letting her do the rest of the portion, he didn't want to somehow hurt her. Being what he had already done to her.* - Sun Nov 15 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Nowww do you want a hug? - Sun Nov 15 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I-I'm fine. . . - Sun Nov 15 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Blushing a small bit, though more than he had in any situation before, being that he didn't even try to fight Kiyoko on anything anymore he'd say, "W-Why would you? I mean you're still hurt right?"* - Sun Nov 15 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing her, he's choke up a bit. Feeling her arms wrap around him, he'd start to move to act as if he'd hug her back, though, he'd stop and let his arms drop back down. Being that he was being hugged, but he didn't return it, he'd let out a sad chuckle, a thought coming to mind, <If only I had met her sooner. . .perhaps a lot of those things wouldn't have happened, or my life would be different. . .>* - Sun Nov 15 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Come ooooooon.~ - Sun Nov 15 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You can do it.~ - Sun Nov 15 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Hearing her, his face would twist a bit more. His hands moving up again, they'd slowly wrap around her, hugging her back lightly. At this point, finally breaking, he'd start to cry, much like the first time Kiyoko had seen him, "W-Why wouldn't I have met you sooner?" letting that out, he'd hug her a bit tighter, though, still aware of her injuries he'd make sure to hold back his strength.* - Sun Nov 15 08:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) His face, basically having two waterfalls on it at this point, he'd continue to hug her, finally letting all of his emotion flood out, "I-I'm sorry for the things I did to you. . .I'm sorry for the things I've done to everyone. . .I-If I had met you sooner, it might not have ever happened. . ." rambling on, it was obvious that Kyoko was getting a side of him that -no one- else had seen. She was basically Acting as everything Aza needed, and he couldn't take it.* - Sun Nov 15 08:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having let the hug end, he'd look to her. Feeling her thumb run across his face, and the words spoken afterwards, it'd only fuel more tears to come out, "W-Why. . .?" getting these words out, he'd attempt to hide his face a bit. "I can't take this."* - Sun Nov 15 08:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Sh, sh... you can take it, you are a strong man and a sentimental man. That's very handsome, you don't need to cry anymore because it's all going to be alright. Okay? - Sun Nov 15 08:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Wiping his own face, he'd look away. "You aren't allowed to die." saying such, he wouldn't leave her with a reason, but if she had followed the things he had been telling her to this point, she'd likely know why.

If she did, he wouldn't be able to take the loss.* - Sun Nov 15 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Nodding he'd mumble, "Sorry. . .I guess that was saying a bit much." moving to his feet, he'd again wipe his face, letting it settling back into his apathetic look, keeping the act going. Throwing his hands into his pockets he'd make his way to the door. "Thanks. . ." not waiting for her is she couldn't keep up, he'd likely make his way to the hungry ant. The idea of taking up drinking crossing his mind, which, he knew wasn't smart, but he was tempted to try it.* - Sun Nov 15 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: There's nothing wrong with you wanting me to live, Aza-san. - Sun Nov 15 09:15:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: At the Hungry ant if you need me. - Sun Nov 15 09:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I know that's not what he meant by that statement. - Sun Nov 15 09:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mhm.~ - Sun Nov 15 09:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Saying such, he'd give her a small smile, "I'm tempted to try drinking. Everyone else seems to use it to forget." saying such, before she could have a chance to respond, he'd already make his way there.* - Sun Nov 15 09:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) Having walked into the Hungry Ant, he'd take a seat, ordering a rather large bottle of sake, of course paying for it, and then walking out.* - Sun Nov 15 09:22:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) should note, he was now holding a full bottle of sake. Being that he had seen Mitsunara's reaction to seeing Yan, he'd be a bit jealous of the two, not remembering the last time he had gotten a reaction like that from Nari. Though, shaking his head, he'd sit in the sand, looking at the bottle intently, tempted to try it, as he had paid for it.* - Sun Nov 15 09:32:09 2015
