<br><br><font color=teal>*Inobu(Punka) says: You can initiate. - Sun Nov  1 15:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) took note of Thaenan's progressing speed. Inobu wasn't going to plan on ending it quickly, but rather poke fun perhaps. It was how he liked to play: soft and easy, then hard and dirty. Then again, it was a spar. In others eyes, Inobu could be seen as average. For your average Genin--he was pretty average. He possessed some good fighting skill, and jutsu skill. He was just all around. As his adversaey made his way towards him, Inobu would make haste, meeting the Traenan half way. Once he came in contact, he'd attempt to throw a punch straight towards his jaw.* - Sun Nov  1 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) kept his momentum going. After the attack was dodged, he brought his fist downward to launch himself into a roll. In effect, he dodged then counterattack, and ended up behind Thaenan. After's the roll's finish, he'd stand up rather quickly. He performed a short string of seals, chakra charging around him, and leaking into the immediate vicinity. As he executed the final hand seal, he kept his hands locked i. that position, making his way towards his adversary once more. Within moments, he'd meet close to him, and the chakra surrounding him would suddenly materialize. Lightning surged through the area, crackling around him. If hit, Thaenan would receive a good jolt of electricity, and possibly be numbed temporarily.* - Sun Nov  1 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Hello, Mizukage. - Sun Nov  1 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) smiled. "Nice to meet you, Thaenan. You can call me Inobu, maybe Ino for short." The jutsu, being easily avoided, was dispersed by releasing the hand seal. He didn't want to give Thaenan any time to recuperate, so he darted straight for him. He took notice of the Mizukage being in the area, and he wanted to impress a little. On the other hand, he didn't want to lose sight of a fun and friendly spar. "Mizukage's watching, no backing down," he'd direct at Thaenan.

Once he was next to him again, he'd attempt an uppercut, using the momentum as built force.* - Sun Nov  1 16:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) began his second round of missions. With the first scroll, he'd pull it out and open it. He quickly skimmed through the mission's contents and description, arching his brow. "This mission seems easy enough to get done quickly." All Inobu had to do was visit the client's house, get the description of a letter, pick it up, and deliver it. The mission client must have been some old lady, since the post office was actually near by to the client's house. Inobu began pacing towards his first destination. As he went there, he'd open the second scroll, which showed that he had to deal with another stray dog in the village. Inobu sighed, he had his fair share of having to rescue to kill stray dogs. He had enough of it.

"Man, this is crazy," he sighed once more. It was funny and coincidental because, all of his missions had been within a close distance of each other. He could probably get a quick run if he needed to, and blaze through all of them with ease. Eventually, he'd reach the client's house, knocking on the door and waiting for someone to answer. Within moments the door creaked open, and an old lady, hunched over and shorter than him, answered. If she could stand and walk straight, she may have been able to tower over hot the young teenager. She gave the ninja the letter's details, and before long, Inobjbwasnoff towards the post office.

About halfway there, he'd hear some whimpering nearby. Out of his sake to help those around him, he forced himself to check out the source of the sound. He found himself within an alleyway, a stray dog all the way at the end. From the rooftops above, and the streets behind could light creep in. Otherwise, it was misty, and hard to see. Inobu arched his brow, looking all over the alleyway to make sure that it wasn't a trap. So far, he was good. He moved closer to the dog, bending towards it. This time, Inobu was fooled once more. The dog was actually the trap. As soon as the boy bent down, the dog poofed into a cloud, unhenging into an actual man.

The man, a wide smirk in his face, held a kunai up to Inobu. He pushed him against the wall, the kunai to his neck. The man actually seemed muscular in size and comparison, leaving Inobu the weaker in a hand-to-hand combat situation. "What do we have here, another victim?" He'd click his teeth, switching hands to grab Inobu by the neck. The kunai would slip into his pocket, as he took the other hand and began to rub it along Inobu's crotch. As much as it did feel good to the boy, he knew it wasn't right. Being the sadomasochist he was, he couldn't do anytbkng but moan and groan. "More!" he groaned. The man smirked, knowing that Inobu wanted what was coming.

He pulled down Inobu's pants, revealing his boxers. Mane, this ambush was turning into a gay rape. Inobu knew he was taking it too far, and he couldn't escape the man's grasp. Right as the man pulled down his own pants, Inobu delivered a strong kick to his groin. In force, this causes him to drop the shinobi, reaching for his bare crotch in pain. "Ob, you're gonna get it now. After I give it to you, then I kill you!" the man grunted. Inobu smirked.mHe was dropped to the floor, and pulled up his pants. "As much as I do love pain and torture, I'm not gay for anyone." Inobu easily performed a few hand seals, conjuring up a circle of fire that would surround the man. He would easily walk into it, baring the the pain and the scorching.

"Perfect." Inobu performed more hand seals, and expended the chakra. It materialized as shocks if electricity, effectively numbing the man as he stood in the fire. As a result, the paralysis, along with the scorching best, would cause his scorching demise. Before it escalated, Inobu got out of there. He killed a homosexual rapits who was henged as a dog, and he was about to complete another mission. He eventually arrived, and picked up the letter to be carried away. The day had already turned out to be interesring, and he didn't want it to get more "interesting " from there. 

With the old lady's letter secured, Inobu took off back to her house, eventually dropping it off there. "Two missions down, one to go."* - Sun Nov  1 20:27:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) arrives near the outside of the village gate. Inobu would stand far away from the massive beast, his head cocking all the way up into the sky to look at it. <What the hell is this thing?> He took care not to be noticed, and wanted to let the beast focus on the other shinobi. Was there really anything a weakling like him could to against the beast? Most likely not, but he would go some fighting shinobi to run off and gather more help.* - Sat Nov 14 18:40:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) watched as the others arrive. He'd stay in the same spot, not moving, though his sights were trained on the beast. "Leave? I don't want to. I'm here to fight, with you guys--if we are fighting. I don't want to back down, even if safety poses an issue." Just then, Inobu watched the fairly large monster be pushed back from all the attacks. Dirt kicked up, skid tracks were left. On the other hand, Inobu noticed that the wounds were healed as fast as they were made. Right then, the boy felt the wave of chakra released by the beast. It was a new feeling, and it was a weird one.* - Sat Nov 14 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Who said anything about fighting.  - Sat Nov 14 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Well, it only destroyed the defenses.. and we attacked it first. - Sat Nov 14 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Hell, it hasn't even damaged the walls yet. - Sat Nov 14 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: But...now with them trying to blow it to kingdom come...I don't think it will let us off with just an apology. - Sat Nov 14 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) was sort of mesmerized by the attacking beast. He had never seen anything like it, but it looked rather dangerous and potent. However, once he saw something gathering near its mouth, along with the orders from the others, he had to fall back. There was no point in being stupid and taking an attack from that thing head on. He'd step back a little, watching everyone else and the monster.* - Sat Nov 14 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) thinks: Hahaha. - Sat Nov 14 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) thinks: Hahahahaa. - Sat Nov 14 19:14:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) || Luckily, all of the shinobi on the walls retreated for the time being, be able to avoid the sudden attack from the gigantic slug. The green acid looked unappealing, but it corroded the walls, essentially disintegrating them without resistance. <Huh, okay. Gonna have to stay away from that.> Of cours, if there was going to be some splash damage coming in the group's way, he'd move to avoid it. <Reasoning tactics? That might work, but they need to be careful.> Inobj, as usual, just stood and watched.* - Sat Nov 14 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: And, I hope it doesn't have a sentient brain because if it hears you.  It will kill you first and- - Sat Nov 14 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) || Apparently, Jirun's plan with his clone and arrow had not apparently worked to its expected effect, and instead, brought the beast's attention to the group of shinobi. Immediately, Inobu knew this was not going to work in their favor. His feet began to twitch, looking around to those near him to see how they would react. The beast was gathering energy once more, and this time--it looked different. It was unlike the green, corrosive acid, but it looked more like a weird chakra. Either way, Inobu didn't want to experience the beast's wrath. Without notice, he took off, darting sideways rather than forwards or backwards. He approached the sea of water.* - Sat Nov 14 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) thinks: Never trust Jirun smh. - Sat Nov 14 19:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: . . . - Sat Nov 14 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) decided to keep moving. Inobu had to traverse as much terrain as he could in order to effectively avoid getting hit by the whatever thing that monster was charging. Kana was able to impede the slug's progress, albeit temporarily. As he passed by Ryutaro, he'd take notice of the gathering chakra, forming a dense cloak around him. It made Inobu feel extremely uncomfortable, yet satisfying. On the other hand, Inbou knew the difference of when he wanted to experience pleasure and pain. He was in the crossfire of Ryutaro's technique, and with a little more speed and pre-emptive action, he was out of it. He skidded to a stop, seemingly a bit farther from the group. He panted a little. "Woah, that was close." His eyes were trained on the bijuu, and the gathering ball of energy.* - Sat Nov 14 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) had been hit by a bit of the crashing waves sent forth by Ryutaro. Since he was on the outskirts of the technique, he would be damaged quite a bit, but he could still function. His direction was veered off course, moving behind the group as he saw the massive ball of chakra fired off. From what it seemed, Inobu had ran far enough to be out of range from the attack. He stood in place, catching his breath as he watched everyone else.* - Sat Nov 14 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) dashed backwards. What the hell was going on?* - Sat Nov 14 20:53:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) would progress forward, watching as the beast was bombarded with all sorts of attacks. He heard its agony and yelps, making him feel rather sorry for the thing. It was sort of like a dog that did its puppy face. He arched his brow, looking around at the others.* - Sat Nov 14 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inobu(Punka) thinks: What's...happening? - Sat Nov 14 22:35:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) would also end up arriving at the gate, per command of the Mizukage to see who was situated outside of the village. He'd arch his brow, wondering who the girl was. However, Heiwa, seemed to pause and notice her. He'd take notice to the girl making strides towards the gate, causing Inobu to move forth and puts both of hos hands up. "Erm, sorry, but I can't let you in without the Mizukage's command. Who are you?" It was weird, Inobu was out of the loop. Who didn't not know who this little girl was?* - Wed Nov 25 06:09:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) looked at both of the headbands. <Izanami? I may have heard that name before. Meh.> Inobu looked the girl straight in her eyes, taking in her apperance and features. He'd turn around, not even noticing Liu on top of the gates. He'd wave his hands so the guards could block the entrance. "Stay put, I'll be right back quickly with the Mizukage's approval of entry...or denial." Inobu would then turn and begin to stroll off towards the mansion.* - Wed Nov 25 06:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Sure, sure. - Thu Nov 26 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) simply lounged around the area outside the Kazekage's mansion, being given nothing to do and being absolutely bored. Tengoku yawned, simply looking around until he found something to do. Immediately, he would perk his head up, thinking on practicing his Flicker movements. He was trained in the jutsu, yet it drained a whole lot of chakra from him. The boy would send chakra in his body around, letting it circulate at a hastened pace until it was about evenly distributed. The chakra surfaced around his skin, primarily gathering at his feet so that he would be able to utilize the high-speed movement technique. He took a step forward, and was suddenly gone from view.

He had seemed to disappear ar his first spot, and reappear at a second spot much farther away. Once he arrived there, he would only pant a little bit before disappearing once more to another spot. This time, he "reappeared" between a couple that seemed to be enjoying a lovely stroll. Unfortunately, he had to break that up, ruining their adventure. Luckily, though before they could even spot him, his disappeared a third time. The final time, he would end up back in his first spot. Beads of sweat ran down his face, the boy panting for a couple minutes before regaining his composure.

It had been a while since he had made use of the technique. Additionally, he was proficient with it, being able to use it in the middle of combat like it was nothing. However, Tengoku was just rusty, and needed some oiling up. That was all.* - Thu Nov 26 06:37:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) was more or less simply playing with a bouncy ball one of his older friends had given him. This boy looked young, possibly younger than one in their pre-teen years. He looked up. taking notice to the girl that seemed to encroach upon the group at the mansion. Tengoku seemed to welcome her with open arms, smiling, "Hey there!"

Of course, while he had a warming demeanor, he was quite wary, and watching her like a hawk. His eyes would seem to occasionally look around the area around her for any subtle changes. He would also gaze over her figure, wishing to pick up anything that wasn't normal. He observed her walk, watching how she carried herself. She seemed to have that manner--ones that innocents usually carried. Shinobi had that nuance in their step that set them apart from others--but not this girl. Nevertheless, he couldn't tell someone by their walk, so he disregarded it in the meanwhile.* - Fri Nov 27 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) looked back to the Mizukage for a quick second, seeing he was still staring into space...or doing whatever he was doing. Looking back at the hooded girl he'd shrug his shoulders, responding, "I'm not too sure when he'll be available. He has been like that for the past few hours now, sorry."* - Fri Nov 27 18:40:51 2015
