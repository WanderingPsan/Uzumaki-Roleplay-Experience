<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hiashi(Punka) could do nothing but hope his last-moment jutsu had worked, along with Kyushiki's poison bombs. He'd stare at the inside of the stone golemn, being nothing but dark in there. He'd snap his fingers, a light eminating from them to illuminate the insides of the being. It revealed weapons and explosives of all types on the insides. "Guys, sorry about that." He'd reveal the weapons, giving people the split-second to react if they needed to. He'd kneel on the floor, letting the light from his fingers separate and move into the air, floating around (If you'd seen Guardians of the Galaxy, it would look like Groot with those lights floating around).

He'd slip the Bible from out of his cloak, opening to a bookmarked page, one that he specially bookmarked himself. It was a passage for death and passing, as well as mourning. It was his favorite, but the saddest. He never thought the day would come so soon. He was a lazy and useless priest, and he knew it. He didn't deserve to pass back at Tenryujoutei. He'd state once more, "I'm sorry I caused this." A single tear would shed from his right eye. He held the Bible open on one palm, and spread his other arm out, palm facing the sky. There was a rosary sitting on his open palm. He'd look up, as if he were praying to God, and those at Tenryujouteo, and all the other priests, and those around him so that their souls would move on in peace.

Especially, he would pray for Edge and Rymei, their killers who would need God's saving grace the most. He took a deep breath, his eyes beginning to shed more tears as he looked towards the sky. He'd begin to recite the passage as the explosions and weapons went off, essentially incinerating him to death. He'd bear the pain for a while, before eventually being brutally massacred and turned to ashes. There would only be torn scraps, and burnt pages of the Bible. However, it's firm leather cover barely remained.* - Sun Oct 25 02:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) went away from the village square, heading off to the place where the first scroll told him to go to. He'd open the scroll, making sure the place was the correct one he was going to. He was correct in thought, and continued walking. He wondered about the company that gave out the mission, wanting some ninja to dif a hole for them. Did they really think it was that easy for a ninja like him. If anything, they probably had better equipment to dig the hole--equipment most likely better than what he could offer. The irony was that he wanted a mission with more action, but he couldn't even bother to dig a hole because he didn't have the right "equipment" for it.

After several minutes of walking and locating the designated area, he'd stop. It seemed they had already prepared the area a little. They enclosed it, separating it from the local pathways. There was a shovel that stuck into the dirt, along with a little paper beside it. It was the plans to the digging, telling Inobu the dimensions of the hole. It had to be several feet wide, and a few feet deep. That wasn't too hard, right? Why did they need it though? He hadn't heard of any recent plans to construct anything new. He simply decided to it anyway. He was getting paid, it would add a mission mark to his record, and it would give him more and better experience.

He took the shovel and began digging. He'd cock his arms back, equipment in hand, and slam the the digging part hard into the dirt. Luckily, the soil was usually soft, but compact due to the mistiness and constant saturation of the village itself. It wasn't hard, but the ground needed to be loosened up. After a while of digging, he would only be less than a quarter finished. He simply decided to make it easier for himself. The young boy raised his hands, flaring his chakra outwards. He leaked it out into the immediate vicinity, then focusing it into the ground before him. He'd go through the seals with speed, only taking less than a few seconds to complete the set.

He'd then exert the chakra. Without notice, the wet soil was electrocuted. Most people knew that Raiton overpowered Doton, so the lightning should have been able to separate the chuncks of soil so that it was both wet and loose. This made it less taxing and easier for Inobu. He'd shovel away, shoveling and shoveling so that the hole would eventually be created. Beside it was a pile of dirt, specifically the pile he created.* - Mon Oct 26 01:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) moved onto the next mission after handing in the scroll to the Mizukage, or one of her NPC jounin. The boy continued on to the next mission, which was to find the runaway dog, and do what he had to do with it. Hopefully it wasn't ine of those stray dogs with rabbies. Hopefully, the dog was very agressive, and loved to fight. Inobu loved a challenge. Most of all, he wanted one that put up a good fight. He wanted to get something out of the mission. He didn't mind if the dog was docile and amicable, it would make the mission easier.<br>
<br>
For now, all the young boy really needed to do was find the dog. There were reports of it lingering around the newly-constructed residential area. Inobu this wasn't good, since a wandering homeless dog would look bad on the housing company, as well as the village itself. If the rumor were true,then not only would it be his lucky day, but then the village would technically owe him a favor. Who let the dog out anyway? Letting it go homeless is such a poort thing to do--unless the owner died, then that would have been too bad. Leaving from the village square, Inobu would head out towards the residential properties in hopes of finding the mutt.<br>
<br>
After searching for around an hour or two, the ninja would eventuallh come across the small animal, who seemed to be cowering in a corner, all scared. It was all the way down an alleyway, as suspiscious and ominous as it had already seemed. Knce Inobu made contact with the dog, a whistle was heard, followed by a snap. Within an instant, the dog exited out of its cowered phase, seeming to strut right past Inobu and to someone who seemed like it owner. In the owner's hand was a kunai, and he smirked.<br>
<br>
"Give me your money, or else face the consequences!" The equipped ninja, kept the smirk. However, Inobu seemed unfazed. Infact, this was the challenge he needed. He simply withdrew a kunai, as if he were ready to attack. His opponent grunted, simply sending the dog after the teenager instead of attacking himself.  He hadn't seen the dog coming, since his attentition was focused on the man. Without warning, the dog bit down into his forearm. As much as it did hurt him, he seemed to enjoy the inflicted psin. "More, more!" Inobu screamed. He let the dog bite and mess him up some more. He could only enjoy it more and more, but the pain would get worse.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, he had to end it there. Simply, he pushed the dog off his body, letting it slide down the alleyway past its owner. "Now, let's get down to real business, shall we?" Without even thinking twice, Inobu jumped right into the action, performing a set of hand seals in no time. He had to get rid of the dog first, before it would actually tear him to shreds. He spread his chakra along the ground, letting it surround the dog. Upon the execution of the last seal, a ring of fire suddenly enveloped the area, moving in closer to the dog in attempts to burn it alive. Next came the guy who tried to rob him. Luckily, Inobu had speed to his advantage. He darted towards the man, stringing together another set of seals.<br>
<br>
<I need to be careful, the combination of these jutsu drain my chakra pretty fast.> With a swift motion, chakra exploded out from the boy's body, suddenly lighting up with electricity. Holding the final hand seal, he kept charging towards the man, holding the aura of lightning. Soon enough, Inobu's opponent would be electrocuted, and kncoked unconscious. By that time, however, the dog would have been dead, burned to crisps. Inobu dropped the final seal, the lightning dispersing. He'd pant, his chakra being exhausted heavily. He'd drag the bodies out into the open, letting the village police come for them. Before they got there, however, Inobj was gone from sight, not wanting to be associated with the act of "cleansing" the village. * - Wed Oct 28 00:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inobu(Punka) finished the second mission, where he had to stop the dog, as well as its sidekick--or rather its owner--from disturbing the peace in the newly-constructed residential properties. Inobu took a little trip to a small, local hospital. There, the wounds and injuries that he had received were healed in no time, allowing him to easily finish the last mission. Upon leaving the hospital, he'd dig into hs pocket and pull out the third and finsl scroll. Opening it, he would read through the description. He arched his brow, sighing heavily afterwards. He'd facepalm, speaking to himself. "I knew it! I knew it! The hole was dug for nothing!"<br>
<br>
People on the street would look at the boy weird, as if he had gone crazy. He was crazy in a sense--when it came to pain--but not that crazy. He simply walked on, heading to his destination: the hole. It was the hole that he dug for his first mission. That sketchy company, the one that ordered the mission was recently discovered to be fake--a false, malicious, scamming company. Either way, they were put out of business, the owners arrested. As a result, the hole was deemed unnecessary, a destruction of village property, a safety hazard, as well as unpleasant to look at. Therefore, Inobu was employed to continue his "good deeds" once more.<br>
<br>
He had to fill the hole back up. Luckily, the shovel was still at the hole, and so was the large mound of accumulated dirt. However, it sat there for a while in the open mist. It began to grow moss on it from the overwatering--where the moss thrived. It had also become a little habitat for small insects like ants. Little holes and burrows were made out to be homes and nests. However, the shinobi had to destroy that, literally having to put them down in the dirt. He looked at the hole, the same as when he left it. Like the mound, however, it had become home to insects and other animals, with moss and grass growing over it.<br>
<br>
Simply, to ease his process of digging, Inobu was going to shock the dirt like he did the first time, which should make the dirt easier to dig into and clear up. He raised his hands, seeping chakra out into the environment all around him, then honing it towards the mound. Blazing through the hand seals, the final one would execute the technique. The chakra materialized, taking on electric-like qualities. The electricity would surge through the mound, breaking up whatever thick chunks of soil there were. Unfortunately, the insects living in there would be electrocuted, essentially becoming roasted crunchy snacks.<br>
<br>
Once he did that, the boy got to filling the hole back up. It was something that wouldn't take long. In fact, it was easier to fill up the hole than dig it out. After several minutes, he would finish ip the work, patting the hole down with the shovel before leaving it. He returned to the Mizukage, his missions finished.* - Wed Oct 28 02:15:15 2015
