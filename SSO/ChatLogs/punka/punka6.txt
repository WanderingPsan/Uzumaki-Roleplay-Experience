<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That too. - Sat Dec 12 15:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright. - Sat Dec 12 15:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Then this will be a spar. - Sat Dec 12 15:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: With a caveat. - Sat Dec 12 15:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You will be fighting in the hidden mist. - Sat Dec 12 15:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: No sight. Rely on your other senses. - Sat Dec 12 15:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Oi. - Sat Dec 12 15:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then I'm immediately down for the count. - Sat Dec 12 15:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Huh? - Sat Dec 12 15:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Nori will be just as disadvanteged. - Sat Dec 12 15:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Nothing, just saying I'm an easy target. - Sat Dec 12 15:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: As is Nori. Learning how to fight in the mist is important - at least to being able to survive in it. - Sat Dec 12 15:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: This is a common hiden of this village after all. - Sat Dec 12 15:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Really? - Sat Dec 12 15:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Nori is a medic - If they fought normally it'd be strictly in Tengoku's favor. - Sat Dec 12 15:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Yumiko, you handle one side of the field, I'll handle the other? - Sat Dec 12 15:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) did the same as Nori had done, performing a single seal that represented the seal of confrontation. It wasn't something Tengoku did much, though he should start. He thought of the previous spar as well, where Yumiko formed the mis, and Sekitsui almost killed the then-little boy. His sea blue hues were trained on Nori, as he attempted to etch her location into his mind. Tengoku knew it wasn't a fair fight, a scout versus a medic. However, it could really go either way. <Either I can do exceedingly well, or mess up really bad. Though of course, I can't go too hard on Nori.~ She's so nice.> The mist formed, enevloping the whole group so that they couldn't even see each other.

Tengoku took a deep breath, closing his eyes momentarily. A burst of chakra was sent for his eyes, the teen purposely exerting a strain on his optical nerves. As the chakra reached it, the nerves began to change and transform, allowing for a little more chakra and blood flow to his eyes. Tengoku opened his eyes, revealing scarlet-hued irises and a pitch black pupil. A single tomoe was etched in, rotating around his pupils before settling in place directly under them. Of course, in the mist, his ocular doujutsu most likely wouldn't have been able to be seen or sensed, due to the chakra covering the vast area. Of course, it was hard for Tengoku to spot his adversary, but he still wanted to train with his ocular prowess. Practice made perfect.

There was a blanket of chakra everywhere, though he was only granted a miniscule amount of perception and sight into the mist, though it was an insignificant help. He took a deep breath, taking some steps forward to get closer to where he thought Nori was.* - Sat Dec 12 15:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *TAKES HIS EYES* - Sat Dec 12 15:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *omit* - Sat Dec 12 15:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) heard some sounds in the nearby vicinity, seeming to originate from Nori's original location. After the emission of the sounds, they were completely gone. This piqued Tengoku's interest, causing him to wonder what happened to Nori. <What is this girl planning?> Tengoku knew of some of her skills, although he had not fought against her in a while. Tengoku had some new skills, and he was pretty sure she had some new skills as well. It was best if he didn't charge right in, but instead wait it out for a little while. The boy inched backwards, moving lightly as to not reveal his new location.
Then stood in place, attempting to pick up what sounds he could from the nearby area.

Then an idea popped into his mind. The boy weaved through a small number of seals, letting some chakra build up as he did so. After the final seal was executed, the chakra was released, causing in the formation of a single basic clone. The clone ran to a different spot in the mist, starting to make sounds with its mouth once it got enough distance away from Tengoku. The purpose of this was to confuse Nori, and make her think Tengoku was elsewhere.* - Sat Dec 12 16:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) || It seemed that the clone he created had done really nothing in his favor. He formed a single seal, and it erupted it smoke, dispering away.mHe was then caught off guard, turning to see some small spherical objects nese him. He couldn't make them out clearly, due to the thick mist, but he was alarmed when the poison bombs emitted a burst of smog. Accidentally, the boy would have inhaled some of it, causing him to uncontrollably cough in response. He raised his arm, using the sleeves of his jacket, to cover his mouth as he regressed backwards away from the epicenter of the emissions. He would still cough here and there. <What the hell was that about Nori? Is she trying to kill me or something?>* - Sat Dec 12 17:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) || A hard kick was planted on his back, causing him to stmble forward back towards the smoke. Before he fully delved into it, however, he was able to inhale a good amount of fresh oxygen for him to hold his breath. The teen was actually surprised by the girl, the kick catching him off guard. After landing in the smog, he stood up and turned around, looking back to where Nori now stood. He squinted his eyes, the smog blinding him a bit. He raised his hand, performing only one hand seal as a transparent layer of chakra coated his sandals. Before the nausea could fully set in, he wanted to deal with Nori quickly and end the spar. He took a step forward, and blazed out of the smoke, running directly towards Nori using the Shunshin technique.

He stopped directly in front of her. attempting to use the built up momentum to deliver a strong punch towards her stomach. If the firt hit was successful, he would follow up with a second attack from behind, attempting to plant a firm kick on her lower back. The string would be completed by a third attack, in which Tengoku would disappear and reappear towards the girl's right side. He performed a sweeping kick, trying to send toppling toward the ground with ease. After all this, his would disappear once more, reappearing farther away from her and the smoke.* - Sat Dec 12 17:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) || The attacks were successful--good for him. Nori let out the loud groans, easily revealing her location. He arched his brow. He couldn't have hit -that- hard, could he? He performed the same hand seal once more, the layer of chakra reinforcing itself around his feet. Tengoku took off, attempting to use his expert skills with the shunshin technique once more. He flickered from his current spot, essentially "disappearing" and revealing himself to the right side of Nori. With his reappearance, he would try deliver a kick toward the upper portion of her body. If successful, the kick would send her into the air, which Tengomu had wanted.

To follow up, he would reappear right above the girl, attempting to deliver an axe kick down on her body, hoping to send her flying down to the ground with speed. However, there was no third attack this time. Following the second attack, Tengoku attempted to get away from the girl again. He flickered to a different spot on the battlefield, waiting on the girl.* - Sat Dec 12 17:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Are those groans? Or..moans?  - Sat Dec 12 18:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Eww Nori. - Sat Dec 12 18:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) took immediate notice of the chains as they erupted from the ground below him, all in attempt of ensnaring him. When he came for Nori, he approached with speed, but anticipated something from her. His attacks didn't hit hard, especially for the strength he had. The caution he exercised wasn't seen, but it was there. His reaction time was good enough for him to notice them, and easily escape. As the chains attempted to wrap around him, he made a speedy getaway. Since he was still active in the usage of his shunshin, he was able to get away without harm. 

He simply sped around the girl, attempting to nail a kick down on her back to send her flat to the ground once more. Successful or not, the move after that would include him speeding away once more to his intended location. <That was a close one.> He panted a little. He had an adrenaline rush from the combat and the dodging, along with some of the usage of the shunshin. However, he lovd it. He felt stronger and faster, though he couldn't let it get to his head. He stood still, standing on the edge of the field, aware and constantly looking around for any disturbances.* - Sat Dec 12 18:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ... I'm probably not the best person to explain this. - Sat Dec 12 21:34:52 2015
