<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alright. - Tue Dec  8 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) looked at the little boy, one who was too young to even be a high-ranking official. Then again, Tengoku was a little too young to be a Genin himself. He took in a deep breath, his eyes deadset on his adversary. Tengoku took a deep breath, momentarily closing his eyes as a rish of chakra flowed through his brain and straight into his eyes. He knew of Anguo's prowess in battle, and the Genin was willing to give it all he could against the Jounin. After a few moments, his eyes were opened, revealing his thickened red irises and pitch black pupils. A single tomoe rotated around the pupil, settling in place right under it. He looked on with intent, showing a seriousness he had never shown before.

Anguo's very faded chakra system came into view. He wouldn't have been able to tell him apart from others, since he wasn't that advanced, but he could tell that it was there. Tengoku raised his hand, performing a single hand seal as a transparent layer of chakra surrounded his body, especially concentrated at bis feet, if Anguo could sense that. He took a step toward his master, waiting on what he would do.* - Tue Dec  8 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) || Once Anguo took that first step, the jutsu activated. The boy was able to notice that first step, with the slight help of his doujutsu in aid with bis above-average sight and reflexes. Tengoku disappeard in a puff of smoke that engulfed him. Immediately, he reappeared right behind Anguo, attempting to deliver a strong kick to the back of his knees to render him to the ground unexpectedly. Then the boy followed up by "teleporting" once more, reappearing at his side. He attempted to send a strong elbow toward his gut to reinforce the surprise leg attack and send him to his knees. For the final execution in the combo, Tengoku sped around his sensei once more, ending up at his other side in an attempt to thrust both of his palms forcefully on his back to send him flat to the ground.

If this were all successful, the scout would shunshin once more opposite from the side where he originally was. He wasn't sure if his combination attack would work, since he had not seen the full extent of Anguo's skills and abilities. However, he did assume that he was much more skilled, and as such--competent to fend him fairly well.* - Tue Dec  8 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) took notice of the various weapons and projectiles coming his way. He could easily dodge most of them, thanks to his perception and reflexes working in tandem. However, some of the projectiles would lodge through his clothing and into his skin, causing him some minor damage. He grunted in pain, some weapons hitting hspis the midsection of his right thigh, his upper left arm, and his right pectoral. With ease, and some pain, he plucked the weapons out. This was where he made the mistake. He suddenly found himself being thrusted backwards, sliding across the ground as a dashing kick was sent ramming right into him. It was rather unexpected, Anguo's speed and strength causing a lot of momentum and force to be packed in one attack.

Tengoku, barely handling the kick, found himself panting on the ground. He had took quite the hit, along with quite the tumble as well. With some attempts, he would struggle to stand up, before finally utilizing his signature technique once more. He dispersed in a cloud of smoke, but instead of appearing behind Anguo, and appeared right below him. The little boy attempted a sudden speeding sweep to send Anguo crashing down to the ground. After that attack, he disappeared again. He appeared right above his sensei, attempting a strong axe-kick from above down on his left shoulder to further slam him into the pavement. He could tell Anguo was holding back, but he didn't know how much.

Tengoku was giving it his all, since that was all he could do. After the attempted axe-kick from mid-air, he would rebound off whichever contact he made with (Anguo or the ground) and shunshin away once more. "Are you holding back for my sake?"* - Tue Dec  8 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) arched his eyebrow as Anguo progressed toward him. Unexpectedly, the punch came, knocking him square in his face. It sent him reeling back in pain. He stumbled back, before falling to the pavement with a harsh thud. "Agh!" he exclaimed in pain, rolling backwards to minimize the impact. In less than a few seconds, he was able to stand back up. However, it seemed the continued use of the Body Flicker took a drain on his chakra. He still had enough for a couple uses, but he'd figure that he'd calm down with the use. He knew at that point, Anguo would probably make a come back. He was panting, one hand holding where he was punched, and the other where he was kicked.

The damage ringed through their respective spots, radiating pain every now and then. He took a good look at Anguo, the unseen seriousness on his face, "Testing yourself for what? I'm not understanding, Anguo-Sensei." Tengoku had the serious tone, but it was clear that he still showed respect to younger, higher-ranking boy. With some space away from Anguo, Tengoku would fire up a string of hand seals, a set of chakra being whisked up from his reservoir. The chakra traveled up to his throt, and into his mouth, taking on the nature of the katon style. By the end of the execution of the seals, the chakra smoothly flowed out and towards Anguo as a breath of fire--akin to a flamethrower. Not before long, the flames ceased to be, and Tengoku had backed up.* - Tue Dec  8 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) || The flames exhausted themselves, signifying that Tengoku had decided not to comtinue forward with it. Anguo came in with his speed once more, delivering a harsh kick that would send Tengoku slipping harshly into the pavement below him. He had no real hand-to-hand combat experience when it came to others attacking and defending against him--only him getting in, overwhelming the opponent with a fluffy of attacks, and then getting out. He fell towards his side, his palms landing flat on the ground to absorb shock and minimize damage once more. His palms on the ground turned into a rollover towards Anguo's side. He attempted to ignore the pain that went through his body for another wuick string of attacks.

The execution of another hand seal saw the disappearance of Tengoku from directly in front of him to right under him once more. The little boy thrusted his leg up into the air, hoping for the soles if sandsls to connect with Anguo's chin and send him into the air. If this was successful, he followed up with another axe-kick from above, attempting to send it along the boy's shoulder to send him speeding towards the ground. If he was all fine after, Tengoku would disappear and reappear farther, panting heavily. This was where the ignored pain set in. He was running low on chakra at this point, and needed to conserve.* - Tue Dec  8 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) huffed and panted. Then Tengoku felt a fading sensation. His ocular doujutsu began to recede, fading away to reveal Tengoku's actual baby blue hues. Tengoku didn't feel like draining more chakra, especially since he still had a long ways to go before obtaining more experience in the doujutsu. He looked over at Anguo, wincing in pain before speaking, "Is...that it? I can keep...going."* - Tue Dec  8 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Yeah...That's it. - Tue Dec  8 02:40:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Am I? I don't think so. I'm too weak. - Tue Dec  8 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I can't properly gauge myself when you're holding back. - Tue Dec  8 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Oh... - Tue Dec  8 02:42:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'll take that as a loss for me, at least in my book. - Tue Dec  8 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: That was the longest I've went with my Sharingan active. I'm making huge progress. - Tue Dec  8 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ...Okay. - Tue Dec  8 02:44:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: He showed me some visions with the Sharingan...Even said I had the potential to use it. - Tue Dec  8 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Really? That's cool, I guess. - Tue Dec  8 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He must have been very powerful with it, if he could show you visions. - Tue Dec  8 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Yeah. - Tue Dec  8 02:51:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I wouldn't tell anyone. - Tue Dec  8 02:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: But, other things come first. - Tue Dec  8 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I can't solely rely on my Sharingan to help me. - Tue Dec  8 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Makes sense. It does seem like it's pretty dangerous to the user after all. - Tue Dec  8 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's not. It doesn't seem as chakra-taxing when I train with it more. - Tue Dec  8 03:06:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You were a friend of Hideki? - Wed Dec  9 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: Mhm, for a brief period. He visited the land of tea. - Wed Dec  9 04:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Nori. - Wed Dec  9 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hi. - Wed Dec  9 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) watches the spar.* - Fri Dec 11 20:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) would have just been walking around, in which he would have seen Heiwa. He smiled, looking at his friend as he waved, "Hey Heiwa!"* - Sat Dec 12 12:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) locked eyes with his friend. It would seem as if it had been a while, maybe a couple years in fact since he was seen around. Catching a lot of sleep and training can really pass time. He took in Heiwa's noticeable changes--his voice, a little more spice in his personality, as well as the growth. <It really has been a while.> Tengoku, on the other hand, had some noticeable changes of his own. Just like Heiwa's, his voice had grown deeper, though a little more deeper. Needless to say, he had started his puberty stages. His hair had seemed to grow out a little more, and there was more "red" to it than since he was last seen. Amidst if all this change, it seemed that his sea blue irises stayed exactly as they weee.

"Just walking around, getting some fresh air. It's been a while, hah. You?"* - Sat Dec 12 12:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) arched his brow. He'd look off into the distance, thinking about Anguo and Geo. He hadn't seen nor talked to them in a while. Their squad didn't really cooperate much together, and were still hindered in progression. "Squad? Right, It's still as dysfunctional as it ever was. I'm not too sure what's been going on with that, especially since after Ryo's death."* - Sat Dec 12 12:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ...Yeah. I haven't seen Geo around much either. I'm not sure the kage cared about the squads that much as of late. - Sat Dec 12 12:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I never really had much interaction with Geo either way. - Sat Dec 12 12:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: At this point, I've simply just been training myself, which tends to get boring. - Sat Dec 12 12:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You could always still train with the rest of my squad. - Sat Dec 12 12:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: We've got the space - and since you're..more scout based anyways it's not like having you join us on a mission would be a problem either. - Sat Dec 12 12:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That would be awesome, thanks Heiwa. - Sat Dec 12 13:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: How's everything going. Guys? - Sat Dec 12 13:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hey Kyubishu. - Sat Dec 12 13:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Going great, thanks for asking. - Sat Dec 12 13:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You? - Sat Dec 12 13:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Alright as much as they can be. - Sat Dec 12 13:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Hey Kyubishu. - Sat Dec 12 13:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: 'Sup, Heiwa. - Sat Dec 12 13:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: We got anything planned for today? - Sat Dec 12 13:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: I don't think so - uh would you two want to train with Nori and I? - Sat Dec 12 13:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Sure. - Sat Dec 12 13:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: She agreed. - Sat Dec 12 14:18:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hey, Nori. - Sat Dec 12 14:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Hey - sorry we're late. - Sat Dec 12 14:45:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: I'll watch for now. - Sat Dec 12 14:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Fair enough - Tengoku, what're you working on as of right now? - Sat Dec 12 14:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Erm. - Sat Dec 12 14:59:47 2015
