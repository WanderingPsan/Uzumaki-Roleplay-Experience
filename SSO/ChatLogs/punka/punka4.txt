Very rarely had he came up to the platform, since its elevation and steepness exhausted his tiny body, even when he used Shunshin to speed up to the top. He panted, walking forward a bit and sitting on the ground. Tengoku would manage to recompose himself in a short time, looking up to see Yumiko. Just as he did with their teammate Ryo, Tengoku would sit silently and watch his teammate do whatever she did.* - Tue Dec  1 00:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Nah, how come? - Tue Dec  1 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm thinking of bringing my squad together for some training. - Tue Dec  1 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You'd be a help in this training. - Tue Dec  1 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Oh? - Tue Dec  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I guess I can help. - Tue Dec  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: --Right. Nori, Yumiko, our radios are on the same frequency. - Tue Dec  1 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm? Oh, alright. - Tue Dec  1 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sekitsui, I'll have a radio for you in a little bit. - Tue Dec  1 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Oh, okay. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In the mean time, Tengoku, lets go get ready. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Are we going to go train? - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alrighty. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. We are if you three are ready. - Tue Dec  1 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: ...I don't know that word he just used. - Tue Dec  1 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Maybe I should start off? - Tue Dec  1 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Go ahead. - Tue Dec  1 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) had no need to tKe a further step. He was already standing in front of the others. The boy looked to the others, then to Heiwa. Throughout his introduction, he would shift his glance between the four people in the region with him. "Simply, an introduction is when you tell other people about yourself," he explained. He cleared his throat, officially starting, "Hey guys. My name is Tengoku. Ten or Goku for short. I am nine years old, and I have taken on the profession of a Scout. My skill mainly lies in the art of Shunshin, as most of you have already seen." At this point, he would glance to Sekitsui, who was the only person who had not seen him in action.

He then continued, glancing to others, "I do have an interest in other professions and fields, however. I want to learn as much as I could, and live a good life protecting others that I hold close. To end my introduction, I'll just interject my usual statement of me saying that I'm fairly weak, and not much of a fight." He'd then step back, bowing in politeness and respect to the others.* - Tue Dec  1 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) (*Higashi, Nori rubs the back of her head for a moment, "My name is Nori. .  Ten years old, and I am the white mag-- I mean medic. Yeah, medic. . I might take up another profession, but for now it's just that." *)

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes, Sekitsui? - Tue Dec  1 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: The medic. - Tue Dec  1 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Precisely. - Tue Dec  1 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori is the primary person to protect in most situations. - Tue Dec  1 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Other exceptions exist, such as a mission built around protecting a person, or a position where ones skills are suddenly elevated beyond where Nori's are useful - but in the most case our work will be cut out on protecting Nori while finishing our actions. - Tue Dec  1 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And this is why we've brought Tengoku here. - Tue Dec  1 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Please, if you would, step up. - Tue Dec  1 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Because of his speed and use of shunshin? - Tue Dec  1 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) would keep silent, letting Heiwa lead the session as planned. He took a step forward, waiting to see what he had planned.* - Tue Dec  1 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Closer, stand beside me. - Tue Dec  1 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The three of you are on a mission. I've been seperated from the group. - Tue Dec  1 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: What does Heiwa have planned? - Tue Dec  1 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You see the faint outline of a rogue shinobi infront of you.  - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ... - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You have one minute to get into position. - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Protect Nori, disable Tengoku, however you choose to play it. - Tue Dec  1 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Oi.~ A mock mission encounter? - Tue Dec  1 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: This is gonna be over rather quickly. I'll try to last as long as I could against them. - Tue Dec  1 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'll just say this. - Tue Dec  1 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If I tap you, let's say you've been assassinated. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Just for the sake of the training. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Have one better. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Wait, what? - Tue Dec  1 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I can still uh. . Defend myself though. . Right? - Tue Dec  1 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ...Interesting. - Tue Dec  1 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) arched his brow, looking over to Heiwa as he scribbled down the kanji. "Rather, dark and moody, wouldn't you say, Heiwa?" he whispered to the boy, joking around childishly. He took the three pages, firmly holding them in his hand. He looked over to Sekitsui, seeing an art like such for the first time. "Pretty unique, I must say. I'm intimidated, honestly."* - Tue Dec  1 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Don't go in yet. - Tue Dec  1 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Wait out their chakra. - Tue Dec  1 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) whispers: Right. - Tue Dec  1 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Why did I do that if I can't see? - Tue Dec  1 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) stood in place. He unconsciously played with the three tags in his hand, shifting through them as he played with them. He kept his eyes focused mainly on the girl that transformed into the beast-esque thing. Needless to say, he still had his eyes on the others shifting through his targets often. Once Yumiko had clouded his vision, he had to keep alert. He had pretty good vision, especially due to training himself in his visionary prowess. It was necessary in being scout. You had to have a good pair of eyes, or you wouldn't have been much of a scout in the first place. He took in a deep breath, letting a layer of chakra lie on the surface of his skin, being especially concentrated around his feet. He had to be prepared foe anything.

This technique, Tengoku had seen before. He couldn't say he was familiar with it himself, but it was a technique in which he was familiar with its mechanics. He was constantly aware, looking around everywhere--above, behind, in front, to his sides, etc. He shouldn't allow himself to be caught off guard, and at least give the others a challenge.* - Tue Dec  1 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) raised his hands towards his chest level. The chakra around his body had already been prepared, especially being concentrated around his feet. The boy, was aware--hearing footsteps and movement in the grass. He wasn't able to pinpoint where and the precise locations, but the sounds became louder as they drew closer. Tengoku was hesitant and shaky. He didn't know the full extent of their abilities, being in the dark about it. He took a deep breath, knowing that he wouldn't be able to oursmart and outskill each and every one of his targets. He couldn't have waited any longer. He remembered Heiwa's words of advice. Instead of letting things come close, he drew farther away from the scene.

Within the mist, a puff of smoke would engulf his figure, wholly swallowing him. He would have been gone from his primary location, deciding not to take any chances. He was like Speedy Gonalez, and within mere moments, he reappeared in a new spot, much farther back than where he first was. Seconds later--if the girl continued to move on her path of destruction, he would have heard a crashing into the ground. <Hm? Did I just avoid an attack?> Tengoku was cautious not to let his guard down, seeming to anticipate and wait for further developments.* - Tue Dec  1 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) was getting ready to speed off again. He couldn't tell where anyone was, or what was happening. The mist was realy blocking his view, messing with his vision. He wasn't really adept in his other senses that he could logically use in this situation, that being his smell and hearing. Maybe he should hone those as well. A great scout should have excellent senses, to find and locate the target with ease. Right as he was getting ready to take off once more, chains berupted from the ground below, encircling his feet and effectively serving as fetters. He was trapped where he was. Eventually, the mist would clear, revealing his predicament--as well as Sekitsui escaping with Heiwa. <Weren't they supposed to just protect Nori? Oh well, whatever. Probably some memo that I missed.>

The little boy would stand in place, "Okay, Nori. You got me with your chains. It's all over." Of course, he didn't know that it was Yumiko that used the technique. He had only ever seen Nori use it, and that was all.* - Tue Dec  1 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If this was on me would any of you be the wiser? - Tue Dec  1 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The technique itself could hinder you in many ways. - Tue Dec  1 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Be careful with that jutsu, Yumiko. - Tue Dec  1 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I would have acted differently, I only use it to make it harder to shunshin an attack as quickly as he could since Nori could have been the first target of such a stratagy. - Tue Dec  1 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Paper* - Tue Dec  1 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . Can I come out now?! - Tue Dec  1 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes. You can come out. - Tue Dec  1 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Perhaps. Not every hostage will be a shinobi, however. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not every hostage will be capable of stating they're tagged.  - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Around near any person it's a good idea to be careful. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Or develop some sensory ability. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: The situation was saving -you-, our squad leader. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Not a civilian. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Yeah, I screwed over your little lesson. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Nice try though. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This time - don't worry. Feeling around me would have been a mistake. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It wasn't a chastisement of you. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) would have simply walked forward, listening.* - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The lesson itself was rigged against Yumiko's usage of that technique. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: I don't see why her using the technique was a bad thing. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's strong. Invaluable even. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: I don't understand. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But it can have detriments. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Collateral..unintentional actions or results - the use of the mist blinds us as shinobis from being able to react. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ....oh that jutsu? - Tue Dec  1 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I thought you meant the other one. - Tue Dec  1 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Tengoku, you aren't hurt, right? - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Yes - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: No. - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: I feel like I could have fotten murdered in that mist. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: You're lucky you moved. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I was about to knock you out. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: OOC OFF - Tue Dec  1 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Having her train against Yumiko or Nori could be hard. She'd likely even be capable of being me too. Especially in Taijutsu. - Tue Dec  1 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Just worked out. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. Your sense of hearing synergized well. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Similar to mine. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: No, smell. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I smelled him. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: And you. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oh? - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Again - interesting. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You'll work well in the team then. Only one who still has difficulty from what I've seen if Nori herself.~ - Tue Dec  1 05:49:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah . . . Wait, difficulty in what? - Tue Dec  1 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Finding your way around the mist. - Tue Dec  1 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh, uh. . That kinda. . wasn't something I expected. - Tue Dec  1 06:05:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Tengoku seems to want to. - Sun Dec  6 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And I don't like teamwork. - Sun Dec  6 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah. - Sun Dec  6 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Obviously you don't understand how this village system works then. - Sun Dec  6 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I hate everyone in our squad besides you Anguo. - Sun Dec  6 00:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Then why won't you respect me. - Sun Dec  6 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I just want a functioning squad. - Sun Dec  6 00:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Because like the Mizukage, I don't respect many people. - Sun Dec  6 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If any. - Sun Dec  6 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I only respect you for your strength, that's all. - Sun Dec  6 00:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm trying to but first. - Sun Dec  6 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: What's your problem with me? - Sun Dec  6 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Why do you keep trying to convince me to do this stuff? - Sun Dec  6 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Because when people work together, they do the impossible. - Sun Dec  6 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: You can get strong on your own. - Sun Dec  6 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: But when there's a group that got strong together. - Sun Dec  6 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: You're probably just going to die. - Sun Dec  6 00:30:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I wouldn't be here if I were on my own. - Sun Dec  6 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I've had so many people help me to achieve my strength. - Sun Dec  6 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Warding off a skirmish army on your own isn't doing the impossible? - Sun Dec  6 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Huh, I need to get out more. - Sun Dec  6 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I didn't work by myself out there. - Sun Dec  6 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You did. - Sun Dec  6 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: What did the others do? - Sun Dec  6 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: What's Ryo's problem? - Sun Dec  6 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Last I checked the others were handling the rest of that attack squad. - Sun Dec  6 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Make a water dragon and hurt themselves? Stand around doing nothing? - Sun Dec  6 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Without you there, that would have been a whole lot worse. - Sun Dec  6 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I only did my part. Others did theirs. That's how a squad is supposed to work. - Sun Dec  6 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: That's how strong I ne- want to be. - Sun Dec  6 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Then work with us. - Sun Dec  6 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Don't just push us away. - Sun Dec  6 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I can't become that strong by doing silly missions and occasional training with a squad that hates me. - Sun Dec  6 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hates you? - Sun Dec  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Who hates you? - Sun Dec  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Geo threatened to kill me. - Sun Dec  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Around four times. - Sun Dec  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Or three, I don't really remember. - Sun Dec  6 00:36:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: I've never really talked to him. - Sun Dec  6 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: This squad will never work because of that reason. - Sun Dec  6 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ..... - Sun Dec  6 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm not working with someone that told me to kill myself and threatened to kill me. - Sun Dec  6 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Just because he is stronger than me. - Sun Dec  6 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I can try talking to him. - Sun Dec  6 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Screw him. - Sun Dec  6 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You can't give up. - Sun Dec  6 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Look, Ryo. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Give up on what? - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I've seen you train before. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You...you have this passion in your eyes, this passion to get stronger. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You look like you don't want to give up. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: So don't give up, not even on this squad. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Please. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I didn't give up. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just don't want to participate. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Also stop spying on me while I train. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I -really- -hate- that. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Spying? I put myself out in the open on purpose. - Sun Dec  6 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Oh...that time. - Sun Dec  6 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: That wasn't training. - Sun Dec  6 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Either way, my statement still stands. - Sun Dec  6 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) smiled, seeming to jump in his spot out of excitment. "Thanks, Ryo. That's th spirit!" He turned to Anguo, "Let's get started!"* - Sun Dec  6 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Good... - Sun Dec  6 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: So, we left off on strengths and weaknesses... - Sun Dec  6 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Why...is he jumping...like an idiot... - Sun Dec  6 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Who wants to share theirs? - Sun Dec  6 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'll go, since mine is fairly quick. - Sun Dec  6 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I've taken up the path of the scout. - Sun Dec  6 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: My strengths include looking for things and people, and travelling very fast! - Sun Dec  6 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I've developed a method of using Shunshin in combat, and I do pack a little strength in my hits. - Sun Dec  6 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: This is killing me already. - Sun Dec  6 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'm fairly weak in Ninjutsu and Taijutsu, though I can utilize them in a basic fashion. - Sun Dec  6 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: My weaknesses include, just about everything else. I am a weak little boy. - Sun Dec  6 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ....You have to have some strength. Don't you focus in taijutsu? - Sun Dec  6 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No. - Sun Dec  6 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Then I guess this will be a little difficult starting out.... - Sun Dec  6 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: We'll have to find a role that fits you. - Sun Dec  6 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) thinks: What would a squad leader normally do... - Sun Dec  6 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I can't really reccomend anything...any ideas Tengoku? - Sun Dec  6 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Erm. - Sun Dec  6 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: What are we defining as "roles?" - Sun Dec  6 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Oh man...this is so dull... - Sun Dec  6 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: The amount of training I could have done by now... - Sun Dec  6 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Like front-line fighter, support...Things like that. From there we can figure out what to recommend as specialization... - Sun Dec  6 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Let's see. - Sun Dec  6 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Well, Geo is definitely our close-quarters engagement guy. - Sun Dec  6 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: If this water was solid, i'd knock myself cold on it by now... - Sun Dec  6 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I assume you, Anguo-sensei, can be our mid-long range fighter. - Sun Dec  6 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ryo, I'm not entirely sure about your role. I do kind of get a taijutsu-vibe from you. - Sun Dec  6 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Sensei..? - Sun Dec  6 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: He better not want me to call him that...so rediculous. - Sun Dec  6 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I have a little taijutsu and ninjutsu skill. - Sun Dec  6 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I can probably float, or maybe serve as a distraction. - Sun Dec  6 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: After all, who dosn't fall for this cute face? - Sun Dec  6 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: That was the line. - Sun Dec  6 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: and he just crossed it. - Sun Dec  6 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ..... - Sun Dec  6 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) would turn and watch as Ryo took off. He looked over to Anguo, then back to Ryo, "Was it something I said?"* - Sun Dec  6 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Just leave...just leave...just...ugh... - Sun Dec  6 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Huh? - Sun Dec  6 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: So it's Taijutsu? - Sun Dec  6 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: My strength is Taijutsu. - Sun Dec  6 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: There you go, Anguo. - Sun Dec  6 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: .....Alright then. - Sun Dec  6 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Why did I stay..? - Sun Dec  6 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I guess now we can start to think up some combos from there. - Sun Dec  6 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec  6 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Most of my techniques are pretty wide-scale and would probably endanger you two...So I'll try and learn some ninjutsu that I could use with you guys. My fuuinjutsu, I can use for support. - Sun Dec  6 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Well, I can use my scout abilities to check surrounding areas for traps and such, and maybe set up some. - Sun Dec  6 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I can use Shunshin and taijutsu to overwhelm while Geo and Ryo handle the resr. - Sun Dec  6 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Yeah, sounds good. - Sun Dec  6 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If need be, I can also do a little ninjutsu. - Sun Dec  6 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Pretty much all for me. - Sun Dec  6 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I can't do anything, i'd just sit back and watch, - Sun Dec  6 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You wouldn't need me. - Sun Dec  6 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ....We will. - Sun Dec  6 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ---Oh. - Sun Dec  6 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Before I forget. - Sun Dec  6 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I have a technique I could share. - Sun Dec  6 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hrm? - Sun Dec  6 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: It'll be useful if we need to avoid sensory-nin. - Sun Dec  6 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: It'll take some decent chakra control, but it should be simple enough. If you guys want to learn it that is. - Sun Dec  6 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Of course. - Sun Dec  6 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) watched exactly what Anguo did, from the hand movements, all the way to listening to his explanations. He wasn't able to pick up on the reduction of the chakra, though he would understand the basis of the technique. Hopefully, he would learn this pretty easily. "Alright, I might be able to do it," he said, enthusiastically smiling.* - Sun Dec  6 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Yeah, it'll take a bit. Just sort of...relax your chakra pathways. Focus on keeping it down, almost like a voice. - Sun Dec  6 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ....Sorry for trying to teach something I'd thought would be useful. - Sun Dec  6 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You didn't teach anything... - Sun Dec  6 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I'm -trying- to teach it... - Sun Dec  6 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You're not explaining anything. - Sun Dec  6 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: There's not really a good way to explain it other than to focus on reducing your chakra... - Sun Dec  6 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: If there was, I'd say it. - Sun Dec  6 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: If I could show you, I'd do it. - Sun Dec  6 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If you didn't notice, I have terrible chakra control. - Sun Dec  6 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So when you say, 'Reduce your chakra'. - Sun Dec  6 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I have no idea what you mean. - Sun Dec  6 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) arched his brow, "Just like a voice?" He'd look into the water, then over to Ryo, who seemed to give up fairly quickly. He smirked, trying to give his team mate some words of encouragement. "C'mon, Ryo, keep trying," Tengoku had probably sounded too annoying at this point, but it was only apart of his personality--the one that he had shown to everyone else and the one he preffered to display. The little boy would crack his knuckles, closing his eyes as he took in a deep breath. He inhaled and exhaled at a slow pace, his stomach extending outwards slightly with an inhale, and vice versa with the opposite. Raising his hands to chest level, he'd mimic exactly what Anguo did with his hands.

As a part of his training regime, Tengoku focused on training some of his control with chakra. If most of his techniques were based in the energy, than it was necessary for him to master its flow. As a result, he was a little skilled at controlling his chakra flow. On the upside, techniques weren't as taxing on him, and they were a a little easier to learn. On the downside, he still wasted precious chakra. Tengoku did just as Anguo said. He'd imagine his mother's voice, her speaking gently into his ears. Her soft-spoken tone was dream-like, or angelic if one may call it that.

It was this same imagined voice that would out him in a relaxed mood. He could feel his hyperactive chakra slowing down. Instead of a rapid and increased flow, the chakra was subjected to a relaxing force. Tengoku wasn't sure if it was working or not, but he stood completrly still with bis hands at his chest. He maintained that evenly-paced breathing. <Am I 'reducing' the chakra? I'm not too sure.>* - Sun Dec  6 01:59:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) would move off to towards the side of the waterfall, letting Anguo and Ryo do their own thing if they needed or wanted to. This little boy was going to train on his own for a little while. He would look at his hands, stretching them out. He raised his thumb to bring it to his mouth, clamping his canine teeth onto a part of the flesh. Interesting. His skin tore apartmfrom the sharpness and the force, causing him tomdraw a small amount of blood. "Tch!" he grunted, the action causing him some minor pain. Tengoku continued to proceed with the hand seals, the blood still leaking onto the ground.

Where the blood landed was where Tengoku slammed his palm flat on the grass. Infusing the chakra into the leaked blood, fuuinjutsu symbols were inscribed on the grassy floor, spreading out in a certain radius from him. <Summoning: Kamoshika!> A small-sized puff of smoke erupted from the fading seal. Within moments, the hazy smoke was completely gone, along with the fuuinjutsu seal. In its place was a small antelope, seeming to look as if it was meant to live in the forest. The antelope would seem to turn and move to Tengoku, gently nuzzling his horns against the boy's face. After a few seconds, it would seem to give up, turning away from him.

The antelope wasn't used to his scent yet, and as such it wasn't all that familiar. "Hey, Kamoshika. Sorry for summoning you on short notice? I don't really need you as of right now to look for anyone or anything. I'm just practicing my skills and techniques with this." Kamoshika would seem to stand still in response, turning around to walk to a nesrby tree and pick the leaves off it and eat. The little boy chased after the antelope, running his the back of his soft childish hands against its fur. It was common belief using the palms to touch an animal's fur could mess up the chemicals, leading to minor negative effect on it. Tengoku wasn't sure of this, but he never took chances.

Kamoshika warmly embraced his touch, before perking its head up and constantly looking around. Within the seconds that followed, the antelope would dart in the opposite direction, running towards the waterfall and then disappearing in a hazy white cloud. Tengoku sighed. "I'm gonna have to get a mastery over this soon, or else I won't Kamoshika will fail me when I need her," he told himself.* - Sun Dec  6 03:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Well then tell me what can you do? - Sun Dec  6 16:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) went off on his own yo train for a little while. After learning the jutsu that Anguo taught him--Chakra Suppression Technique--, he wanted to master it as fast as possible. With his little experience in chakra control, the drain for the technique was fairly low, meaning he could use it multiple times in succession if he really needed to. However, this wasn't one if those techniques that you would rapidly fire off. It was typically a one-and-done, where it was used to lay low from sensors and such. In actuality, it was a good technique to learn, especially for a acout like him. On the downside, he wouldn't be able to use Shunshin while it was active. He didn't mind though.

Tengoku cracked his knuckles, and figured it would be a good idea to train something else while he trained his suprression jutsu. However. he didn't know if it would work once the suppression was active. The little boy momentarily closed his eyes, letting the special chakra in his brain release. It flowed freely through brain, meeting no resistance as it traveled. It naturally made its way to the boy's two eyes. Then, the chakra sparked a reaction. The boy was met with a slight burning in his optics, causing him to bite his teeth a little. He could feel the chakra changing his eyes, transforming them.

Within moments, it was all over. Tengoku opened his lids, and revealed his transformed eyes. His irises were scarlet red in hue, his pupils being the same pitch black as they were before. However now, there was a small black speck that was stained on his widened irises. This tomoe looked similar to a comma; it rotated around his pupils at a hastened rate, before settling right under it, visible in plain sight. This Stage 1 Sharingan granted Tengoku a few benefits, like allowing him to see chakra in the immediate vicinity, though very faded. At a very low level, he was able to see movemenets around him, though he could not sense subtle movements.

Next, Tengoku moved on to perform the suppression technique. He held his hands up to his chest, forming a single seal. The pace of his breathing dramatically decreased. After some time, he could feel his own chakra beginning to slow down from its usual hyperactive state. As Anguo relayed to him, he would try to think of a calm soothing voice--his mother's. The boy thought of her putting him in bed, singing a gentle song to make him relax. It worked perfectly. A minute amount of chakra was expended, being used to reduce the chakra's activity so that it couldn't be sensed. However, Tengoku could still feel his Stage 1 Sharingan very active.

The boy could feel the chakra that eminanted from it, as it was a different source that only existed within his body. He'd arch his brow, "That's interesting, now I know I can use my doujutsu and suppress my chakra at the same time," he said aloud. With just a single hand seal, along with the word "Release," his chakra erupted back into its hyperactive state. If any sensors were around, it would seem as if his chakra flared uncontrollably, and the. settled down only a little.* - Sun Dec  6 17:27:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Maybe we should move away from this area first. - Sun Dec  6 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: It's fine, we spar over here all the time. It's an open area. - Sun Dec  6 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alright, then. - Sun Dec  6 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) moved over towaeds the side of the area. It wouldn't be a fair fight if he could so easily get cornered into the building. Tengoku put his fists up, taking a step forward. His goal was to slowly inch towards his adversary, progressing at a small pace. "Take it easy on me will ya' please?"* - Sun Dec  6 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) kepts his arms and fists up. Tengoku was -very- inept at Taijutsu, and he knew that it was Kyubishu's fort. In all honesty, Tengoku was ready to get wrecked, but he didn't know how bad he was going to take this beating. His eyes were trained on his adversary, his above-average sight in combination with his reflexes giving him some leeway to redirect the attack elsewhere. He wouldn't have had enough time to move it away from his body, thus his arm went up to bring Kyubishu's fist downward. The attack went right into his chest, causing him to slide back on the ground with a loss of air.

Tengoku gaspsd for a few seconds, struggling as the pain radiated through his chest. "Oi!" he screamed in pain, attempting to get up afterwards. He breathed heavily, trying to get that lost air back, before continuing with something of his own. He raised his hands to perform a small amount of hand seals. It was fairly quick, due to the fact that the technique was low-ranked. The little boy, as he inhaled, drew chakra into his lungs. Upon the execution of the final hand seal, the chakra came rising up through his throat. Tengoku opened his mouth, and the chakra lit aflame, pouring out as a flamethrower aimed directly at Kyubisbu.

Tengoku didn't have a lethal intent, especially since he couldn't really do any lethal damage with the attack. However, he hoped to get some damage back in his adversary. For a boy his age and rank, he seemed to have some control over his chakra, seen in the fair amount ofnfire he was able to spew. After a few moments, the fire ceased, and Tengoku waited.* - Sun Dec  6 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tengoku(Punka) smirked, his katon-styled technique serving as the distraction he needed to really get the pace going. He noticed Kyubishu withdrawing the shuriken as he progressed forward. <What tactic is he using?> To Tengoku,mthe plan Kyubishu had going seemed rather odd, especially for the taijutsu-based fighter Tengoku thought Kyubishu had been. Either way, it would have all been in vain as Tengoku weaved only one hand seal. Upon doing so, a thin transparent layer of chakra formed in top of his skin, being more and concentrated around his feet. A smirk formed on his face, as he actually seemed to take a step towards the shuriken flying his way.

Without a moment's notice, the small boy had seemed to disappear. He was engulfed in a cloud that masked his movements, most likely not permitting Kyubishu to know where he "teleported" to. Tengoku reappaeared right behind his opponent, attempting to deliver a strong kick to the back of Kyubisbu's knees in order to send him to the ground. If he were successful, he would follow up with another reappearance at his side, trying to swing his elbow around so that it rammed right into his stomach. After that, Tengoku went in with his final quick-strike, reappearing in front of Kyubishu and attempting to send a quick jab to the boy's throat to make him temporarily choke.

If it was all successful, he would shunshin once more and finally reappear at a different spot than where he first started--all the way behind Kyubishu. "I said take it easy on me. I'm fairly weak."* - Sun Dec  6 19:46:59 2015
