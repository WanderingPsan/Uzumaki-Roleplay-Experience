<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh. ..  - Sun Nov 22 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: So this is where the pub is. - Sun Nov 22 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov 22 16:43:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) look out the corner of her eye taking note of Kokoru and Mengde speaking. She remain silent simply observing for now only nodding her head taking in the information recieved.* - Sun Nov 22 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Heiwa c'mere. - Sun Nov 22 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) takes her bow and begins moving towards Kokoro. She was completely relaxed for now. A yawn escaped her while she moved towards him."Mmm right." she said deciding to see just what he could do.* - Sun Nov 22 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Like wise. - Sun Nov 22 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well then I guess you can have the first move.~ - Sun Nov 22 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Kana, C'mere. - Sun Nov 22 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) took note that Kokoru was a close range fighter and decided to take advantage of that. While the he was jogging over towards him she decided to do something risky in short. Her eyes not leaving him since this was a one on one. 

With the bow in her hand she channeled chakra to it while begining to move back. She was moving back at a much slower pace however. Once she was ready she unleashed a chakra arrow aim directly at Kokoru's leg hoping to ether make contact with it or force Kokoru to back off. * - Sun Nov 22 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) wasn't going to make this easy for him. She puts the bow in her mouth while he was walking and formed a single hand seal. Her eyes continued to observe the male the entire time not letting a single moment miss her. As soon as he took off she decided to make her own move.

Once he dashed straight she let him get a bit closer until a cloud of smoke appeared. She might have not been a flicker fighter, but when it came to mastering the jutsu she had that down. She shunshin away from Kokoru going to the other side where of the area to be vertically lined up with the sign next to Nori. Then she took the bow out of her mouth and took aim again.* - Sun Nov 22 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: That's still quite a lot of chakra to use.  Hmmm. - Sun Nov 22 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: She's using too much chakra..Yumiko can't sustain that anymore. - Sun Nov 22 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: At this rate she has to be going for a quick finish. - Sun Nov 22 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) lowers her bow and shakes her head."Alright. I wanted to see what he could do if I decided to remain long range." she said moving next to Nori.* - Sun Nov 22 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Where would I shoot someone in the stomach if I don't want to kill them? - Sun Nov 22 21:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) thinks: But this new kid might have a few tricks up his sleeve. - Mon Nov 23 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) looked out the corner of her eye and then back towards Kokoru."Are we okay to begin yet? she asked not wanting to make the first move until she had the okay even if she was taking aim at Kokoru before hand.* - Mon Nov 23 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Aye. Let round one begin! - Mon Nov 23 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Come on, Yumiko. You've got this.. - Mon Nov 23 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) took note of his pattern and begin to brace herself. While he was running she built up chakra. She had takenaim for a reason and began to build up chakra as well. While he came towards her she decided to go for an approch that might have caught of him off guard.

Instead of backing away and fighting long range, she took off full sprint towards Kokoru deciding to get in close. Her arrow were chakra based and because of that she had an advantage."Dodge this!" she thought to herself hoping to be close enough to the male but further then arm's length from him.

Once she was close the girl fired the arrow towards the right side of his chest. Away from his heart and what not hoping to not kill him with the shot. A close range projectile being released hoping to hit. She intended on now showing off her other techniques just yet, but she also didn't intend on wasting a lot of chakra ether.* - Mon Nov 23 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Does this put me against Kana? Or is there someone else I'd be fighting? - Mon Nov 23 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) once she realized she missed the girl backed off adjusting her bow. When his foot moved she decided to use it as a sheild and let it take the damage since she couldn't completely avoid his attack. However this attack did kick the bow up in the air. Still the bow was in one piece. It was a sturdy bow that's for sure.

Now disarmed she weaved together hand seals at quite the good pace.Three hand seals were formed and her mouth open."Suiton Mizurappa no jutsu." she thought to herself her eyes opening. Her cheeks expand filled with water and she forced quite a bit out of her mouth towards Kokoru while he was still close range hoping the sudden attack was enough to knock him out. * - Mon Nov 23 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) almost tripped but knew when to stop. She went and picked her bow up which fell to the ground and because of Mengde's actions she didn't utilize her suiton technique."Um okay."* - Mon Nov 23 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Good. ..The winner is Yumiko. Kokoru you did a good job. - Mon Nov 23 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Next fight. Heiwa, Nori. You're up next. - Mon Nov 23 01:01:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) unstraps her bow and holds it out. She looks down building up chakra and forming it into an arrow. The goal was to shoot it as far out into the sea as possible and hope to god she didn't accidently hit something. She didn't want to be labled a murderer. 

"Eyes open Nori-chan.Tell me how far this arrow goes" she said getting ready before unleashing the arrow. Although Yumiko held no accuracy which is why she did not try for long range fighting when using the bow against Kokoru. She was still new to the weapon after all.

The arrow flew but did not go very far. Luckly for Yumiko she did decide that choice because if she hadn't she'd be screwed. Mean while Yumiko decided to prepare for another shot after hearing what Nori thought which she thought the girl was going to dissapprove.* - Mon Nov 23 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) lifts her hands up interlocking them as fast as she could. A quick series of hand seals were made and the final one was held. She work on using less chakra than before but that was rather difficult. Bringing out a rather large amount of chakra she spoke."Kuchiyose Maneki neko no jutsu." she said.

The water splits and the summoning was formed. Water dripping down the large statue split in two. The statue held a lot of the water that was between it and clamp together rather quickly trapping the water inside of it since there was no better target than that.

The chains arise from the ground afterwords wrapping around the neko statue and drags it back down. The ground shaking from the action while it did so. Bit by bit the statue seem to dissappear taking the water it had with it to a different place. However to try and avoid future complications with things she let the water be transfered to a different part of the ocean.

Not wanting to repeat this method right now the girl sits down and relaxes. She focused on regaining her chakra to avoid stressing herself out to much.She breaths in and out slowly nodding her head."That's still a bit rough to use." she said to her self nodding her head.* - Mon Nov 23 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) pulls out a bottle of milk and opens it. She begins drinking it while relaxing on and looking out to the water. An audible sigh escapes her lips while she does this. She enjoyed resting for a bit. Mean while she gradually restores her chakra and went as far as to pull out a candy bar eatting it.

Once she was rested and had a snack she got back up quickly to continue. She lifted her hands up forming a single seal. She took her time to practice her control and since there was no rush to use the jutsu she slowly build up her chakra making sure not to waste to much of it while doing so. 

She then makes the other hand seals slowly while molding her chakra and focusing it on the ground parting it and making room for the statue. From below the jutsu was rising from the ground. The statue that was split in half for the time being. 

"Kuchiyose, Maneki Neko no jutsu." she said once the statue was completely out. The statue closes once again trapping water in it. Then the chains wrap around it. Focusing her chakra the statue sinks back into the ground causing it to shake slightly while doing so.

Once the statue did this it transported the water and any fish that might have been caught up in it further out into the sea like before. She exhales again before saying "That's enough for now." and hading back into the village.* - Mon Nov 23 15:43:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm.~  - Mon Nov 23 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: So, we're going to Spar Yumiko. I want to see where you're lacking. - Mon Nov 23 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: C'mon..Show me your skill. - Mon Nov 23 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright.~ - Mon Nov 23 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: C'mon now Yumiko. Show me your skill. - Mon Nov 23 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) shifts her leg in front of her and slides her bow off her shoulders. She lifted it up taking aim at Mengde while building up chakra. Since a moving target was much more effective than a still target it would be much harder to hit and considering he was quite the distance away this was good practice for her.

An arrow of pure chakra forms on the bow and with her stance ready she began by firing it at him, but because she wasn't good with the bow and combined with the distance the arrow went away from her mark which initally was Mengde's arm to a bit to his left.

Because of this Yumiko decided to move closer towards him but not to close however. She still needed to train her eye sight and aim like he said after all.* - Mon Nov 23 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) with him closing in she had to find a way to react fast. One thing about archers was getting in striking range with close range fighters is not a good idea. She decided to back off a bit to give her a bit of breathing room. Building up chakra again with Mengde being closer to her then before she decided to strike again.

This time she aimed for his leg. With him being closer than before the accuracy was improved a bit. She went for this stratagy because a slower target is easier to hit than a faster target.* - Mon Nov 23 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) shakes her head and takes a seat."Alright then."* - Mon Nov 23 19:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 23 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Talking about Kumo. Wondering if the kage is planning to do anything against it.. - Mon Nov 23 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's a mystery but after what he said he might be planning something in general. - Tue Nov 24 01:08:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. . . - Tue Nov 24 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's a jutsu. A hiden in Kirigakure. Curious about them? - Tue Nov 24 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . In a way. . Yeah. . - Tue Nov 24 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Chains. . . Oh god, yes. . - Tue Nov 24 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Might also pick that up. Seems like a useful binding jutsu. - Tue Nov 24 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's strong - it'll likely help you both out. The scrolls should be in the archives - but do you want me to show you instead? - Tue Nov 24 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes please. - Tue Nov 24 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sure.~ - Tue Nov 24 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. It's still a hiden though - only the kage and us three will know it.~ - Tue Nov 24 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Lets go outside. - Tue Nov 24 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) looks over towards Heiwa and begins to mold her chakra. She thought about how chakra created chains and liken it to suiton. Using chakra to create something that wasn't there before. Not saying that chains and water have anything in common.

She watched his hand seals and waited for the explination.She tried to apply the right amount of control and the right amount of chakra for herself to utilize the jutsu since she was still learning the technique. Since she had been studying chakra control and had decent control for her age Yumiko decided to use a small bit of chakra confident she could get it the first try.

The girl finishes the jutsu andfocused on Nori's current location. Since she was the first to ask about the chains Yumiko decided to try and use them on her first. This caused a bit of disturbance in the ground as well as metal to form. However, the shape manipulation on her end was off meaning the chains did not form correctly. It was jus scrap metal. Chakra scrap metal that was useless in other words.


Yumiko look out the corner of her eye acting like she did not do anything at all. She sits down and crosses her legs indian style as some people call it and begins to think about her mistakes. "Mistake number one. Take this more seriously and try binding her as if she was an enemy." she thought to herself ruling that out as the first potentional mistake she had made.

She continued to think for a bit and stood up after a moment. She stratches her legs out and went back at it. With her hand seals she lifted them up weaving them together above the avarage speed, and slower than Heiwa. She took her time building up her chakra when she made the metal she applied shape manipulation to turn the metal into chains. 

"Chains of Absolution." she thought to herself this time aiming to tie up Nori the best she could and trap her in the chains. Only for a moment before the chains faided back into the ground once more.Yumiko then turns her attention to the acadamy due to Mengde's announcement.* - Tue Nov 24 04:58:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Tell me. . .Yumiko? Do you use a sword? - Tue Nov 24 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) walks off to the side and turns to her left. She shook her head left and right to Abraxas's question.* - Tue Nov 24 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) whispers: The individual isn't a Fuuinjutsu or Genjutsu User I'm sure, but he's on probation and you're the chuunin that I want assigned to him currently - Tue Nov 24 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) lifts her bow and decided to start off with something small. She didn't know what type of fighter he was and wanted to get a feel for his fighting style of course. The bow she weilded had no string oddly enough but she did begin to build up chakra.

The chakra flows into the bow. Naturally he was already to close for comfort and she needed to get away."Someone with a bigger body older than me will hit harder." she thought to herself. An arrow of chakra was formed and she shot it aimed at his leg. She wasn't great with a bow but she was decently close to him in the first place.

Once the arrow was shot Yumiko then moves back trying to gain some distance away from him. As one would suspect from an archer being close to someone was not comfortable for her in general.* - Tue Nov 24 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) thinks: Yumiko has no chill...Like does she not know how to hold back? Hahah. - Tue Nov 24 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) thinks: You're not teaching him. Simply watching over him..Making sure he doesn't get into any trouble. - Tue Nov 24 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) continued moving back noticing the crystal on his arm. Her eyes shot open noticing he was much different than the other boy she fought. She didn't want to get close to him that was very clear."Interesting." she thought to herself doing something he might not think she'd do.

While moving back the young girl decided to drop the bow willingly and weaved together hand seals. He had the longer reach with his arms and blades so she had to resort to ninjutsu."Suiton." she thought to herself her eyes narrowing onto the person hoping to keep far away from him.

Her cheeks puff up deciding to settle this with a different method."Mizurappa no jutsu." she thought utilizing her technique hoping that the ninjutsu was enough to force him back. Her aim was his stomach for the reason being it was a wide target.* - Tue Nov 24 05:58:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Instead of making a jutsu that is not in-fighter based. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: It was simply the easiest to make. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then for now you're an in-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He is an in-fighter due to his inability to in-fight. He does not want to be an in-fighter, but he is one nonetheless. He can best improve by following his wants and working on ways to be an out-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:33:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) lifts her hands up deciding to experiment with the effects of the jutsu first hand. The target was herself since this was her practicing it herself. That and she never felt the effects of the jutsu. She knew it couldn't be to pleasent because she seen how people react to being caught in it but she wanted to know how strong her chains really were.

She moves her hands interlocking them in order to form the correct seals needed for the jutsu. She places her hand on the ground and lets the chains form under her. The girl's chakra sinks into the ground and begins forming. Shape manipulation took place while the creation of chains were made out of her chakra.

Soon enough part of the ground opens up. Not a massive amount of the ground but rather only a small bit of it and there the chains came up wrapping around her entire body pulling her to the ground. She was bound by her own jutsu which she wanted and because of that she as calm about the situation.

Once the jutsu fully took effect Yumiko tries to move her body only to find out she couldn't. She couldn't muster up the strength to resist or break out of the chains."Hmm so this really is effective to capture someone." the young girl said to herself.

The girl maintains her chakra flow still at the current time. She was not wasting stamina for now but rather observing the jutsu from a victim point of view."It's like real chains. I can see why those two couldn't break it. Even that man I had the spar with could not break out if he wanted to I bet." she said to herself reflecting back on her spar ith Abraxas.

Finally the girl begins haulting her chakra flow. The chains became weakerand eventually went back into the ground dissappearing as if they never existed in the first place. Mean while Yumiko picks herself up and dust herself off coughing a bit.* - Tue Nov 24 17:19:21 2015

She didn't need to leave a cloud of smoke behind because the mist was already in the way. Yumiko felt it was a bad idea to use that technique. However she did find it needed to get away from the mist and haulted her own flow no longer maintaining it.

His attack speed was amazing. He was someone who she thought was an S rank criminal. She hope that the distance she got was enough to get her out of target range.* - Wed Nov 25 09:09:07 2015
