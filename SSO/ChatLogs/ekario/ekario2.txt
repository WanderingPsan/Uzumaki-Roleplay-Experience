<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: It was. - Wed Nov 11 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) since she had a bit of down time she decided to practice a bit. She weaved together a hand seal needed for the jutsu and turns her body. The girl vitalized her body for a moment and decided to move a short distance trying to use less chakra than what she previously did before hand. In a split second she moved at extremely high speeds to the other side of the room and kneel down on the floor.

The movement was still to much. She was extremely dizzy from the movement and this made her breath out harshly. The stamina and chakra drain it took damn near made her pass out.She shook her head left and right trying to gather herself while resting.

"How do people deal with this?" she thought to herself rubbing her eyes and putting her back against the wall looking up at the ceiling still a bit dizzy from the aggressive movement she just made. Sweat was rolling down her face rather quickly.

Once she was able to regain her composure the girl gets up and begins walks out obviously fatigued from the stunt she pulled. Her body was telling her something important. Ether she was going to lay down on a bed or she was going to lay down on the floor and the former was sounding like a better deal to her.* - Wed Nov 11 14:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) lifts her hands up forming a single hand seal. She then decided to try something out as an experiment. Grabbing her boken she sendsa surge of chakra through her body deciding to utilize both kenjutsu with a slash. As dizzy as it was going to leave her she thought about experimenting. Since she had rested the girl thought about trying one more time.

A cloud of smoke appeared around her and she attempted to strike still rather sloppy with her form. She sits down afterwards feeling the side effects from the technique and dropping the boken to the ground. She looks at her hand seeing about five of them due to being disoriented.

Exhaling she thought about one thing. The difference in strength between a child and adult. To compensate for it she thought about using speed to make up for the difference striking rather quickly using the technique to her advantage but that was easier said than down. 

While she stared at her hand she let the effects wear off before standing up again. She walks to the bed and sits down folding her arms for a moment inhaling and exhaling nodding her head. "Perhaps I should get use to normal combat first before trying high speed combat." she thought still trying to catch her breath.

One she finish catching her breath she stands again moving over to the boken and picking it up. She felt rather done for the day and walk out into the living room wondering if anyone else was awake right now.* - Wed Nov 11 17:41:58 2015

She gave Heiwa a nodand look out the corner of her eye continuing down the path."Nori how fast can you run?" she asked curious so she could manage her chakra better if need be. Yumiko was expecting a good answer. However, she didn't get her hopes up yet.* - Sat Nov 14 07:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) traveled through the village looking around quietly. She took in her surrondings for the time being noticing how this was rather different than what she usually saw but none the less she was quiet.

She then saw the group of chained people on the ground. A swordsmen, a girl and now to add insult to injury another man. Her eyes scan the situation not taking action yet. She had her orders after all.* - Sat Nov 14 08:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) wasn't as fast as Heiwa but did try to assist. First order of business was to assist Heiwa with the attack after all. Deciding to remain further away she also pulled out an object with something attached.

She didn't move to far. Not as far as Heiwa due to orders after all. She waited until the women had attempted to ether defend or avoid what Heiwa did before throwing her kunai towards the girl's leg hoping to get near it or sink in it.* - Sat Nov 14 08:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Done. - Sat Nov 14 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) had much more trouble dealing with the lighting simply because she wasn't as fast as a fe others. Her eyes shot open deciding to do the one thing possible. She herself formed a hand seal deciding to uitlize shunshin to try and get the hell out of there. Of course even so she was still to slow.

Her arm got shocked from it doing quite a bit of damage to her. In short her arm was fucked up and Yumiko was on her knees dizzy and disoriented from the effects of the jutsu.* - Sat Nov 14 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) still was feeling the effects from the jutsu so she couldn't quite see clearly. Her arm as numb as hell and she didn't want to get up at the moment but she did respond in a whisper to Ziare trying to prevent Leera from hearing her speak."We're a squad from Kirigakure meant to find things from the village to help Kirigakure. People as well. Lady over there stabbed the other person when we got here and we got involved. Then you saw what happen afterwords." she said trusting the man.* - Sat Nov 14 09:51:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Shut up slut. - Sat Nov 14 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) closes her eyes now resting up against the tree, Her arm was pretty badly damaged. She breaths out and begins speaking."Dead, keep her alive she'll be more trouble to the mission" Yumiko said out loud more as a suggestion rather than an order.* - Sat Nov 14 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And you kid? Dead or alive? - Sat Nov 14 10:01:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) nodded deciding to lean on him and move. Her arm was throbbing and it was badly burned as well. She breaths out and spoke."Yeah...had enough pain for one day."* - Sat Nov 14 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Follow me. - Sat Nov 14 10:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) let her arm hang while heading to the northern gate. Upon seeing him she spoke."Ah he's from that village!" she said out loud remembering he got stabbed.* - Sat Nov 14 10:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: She had a nasty mouth on her. - Sat Nov 14 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: If she attacked as soon as you got there, she was trying to hide soemthing. - Sat Nov 14 10:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Soemthing valuable to her. - Sat Nov 14 10:56:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Very well. What sort of shinobi was this woman? What sort of techniques did she use? This could tell us more about her and if she was from another village...I'd hate to find out we killed one of the Kazekage's fold. - Sat Nov 14 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The speed she moved was nearly too fast for me to see. I couldn't take note of her pupils.  - Sat Nov 14 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And she attacked not me but the man you saw at the gate - the one in the bingo book. - Sat Nov 14 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It was just a coincidence we arrived at that point. - Sat Nov 14 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: As for the techniques: She uses a raiton ninjutsu. That's what damaged Yumiko's arm. - Sat Nov 14 10:58:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Interesting...Such a technique would prove useful and quite dangerous. It's good you weren't harmed. Very well. You did a good job. Your next mission will begin in a few days. I'll be sending a small outfit into Konohagakure to search for Technique Scrolls left behind by the previous ruling group. Our village is in need of information to pass on to our younger generation. - Sat Nov 14 11:01:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Very well. The chains were used for binding - wrapping around and constricting. They seemed to be made of iron? - Sat Nov 14 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Oh? Well it's your mission to catch and liquidate him. You can leave whenever you're ready. Ziare here will assist, he says he owes this individual something. - Sat Nov 14 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But they were obviously chakra constructed. - Sat Nov 14 11:03:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm... - Sun Nov 15 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) also looked over the scroll while Nori was doing so. She felt more comfortable in walking sos he did so. She wondered why the person they faught had such a thing on her. Maybe to give to someone else? Anyways she didn't know to much nor care after a while.

Continuing to read she look at Heiwa."We should get going. Don't want to be punished by the Mizukage." she said stretching her legs and yaning.* - Sun Nov 15 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) continued reading the scroll and head outside. She was curious about the technique and wanted to try it out. She look at the hand signs memorizing them for the moment while outside due to not wanting to break the house.

She went through the process of the blood and hand seals before slamming her hand on the ground."Kuchiyose Iron maiden." she thought to herself trying to make it appear. Sadly she only manage to get smoke out and nothing else. A grunt escapes her afterwords.* - Sun Nov 15 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) didn't seem to get any where that time so she sits down and rereads the scroll. She decided to try and memorize every detail instead of rushing it through it. She found it more efficent that way. She didn't know to much about Kuchiyose, if anything she expected this to move and be like a talking animal. * - Sun Nov 15 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *Yaawns* - Sun Nov 15 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) look towards Heiwa and then to the scroll again. Since she read through it the girl figured it was time to try it out once more getting up and heading outside. Once she was out there she bither finger weaving together the required hand seals for it and slamming her palm on the ground. Then it happen smoke appeared around them and yet nothing came out of it. At least she showed some improvement than the previous time.* - Sun Nov 15 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) feeling so close that time she decided to try something. Although she hated this method because something people love is using less chakra for a technique the girl figured maybe not enough chakra was put into the technique the last time. Shuffling through the hand seals again she spoke."Kuchiyose Iron Maiden." out loud already having a bit of blood drawn.* - Sun Nov 15 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh, uh. - Sun Nov 15 06:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Or is it just going to be taijutsu? - Sun Nov 15 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I only know how to heal, so it will just be taijutsu for now. - Sun Nov 15 06:53:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm not too proficient in it  - so don't worry about anything like that. - Sun Nov 15 06:59:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Ngh..Do you have a planned date for this then? - Sun Nov 15 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) came outside after feeling the earth shake. She watch the statue drag the tree and cross her arms."Mmm it's pretty strong." she comment yawning.* - Sun Nov 15 10:26:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: That's great. I'm glad to hear you're getting better. - Sun Nov 15 10:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not just yet. Reason being is because I had the problem of needing to learn another technique since shunshin was one of the few things I needed to practice. - Sun Nov 15 10:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I don't catch your drift. - Sun Nov 15 10:33:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Are you done with that scroll? - Sun Nov 15 10:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Ah then yes. - Sun Nov 15 10:36:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Eh, that's inconsequential. Would you mind giving me the cat scroll? I'll go and place it in the archives. It shall be a Hiden Secret Technique of Kirigakure no Sato. - Sun Nov 15 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) removes the scroll from her pocket and tosses it to him."Alright then.~"* - Sun Nov 15 10:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The one we met in Konoha. - Sun Nov 15 11:01:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Good..Good. - Sun Nov 15 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) stretches her arms and legs a bit making a singlehand seal. With less chakra than before the girl decides to try and utilize the jutsu and movethe same distance like she usually did in an attempt to make the jutsu itself more efficent in an actual fight. Reason being when she used the jutsu before she used most her chakra and the results were not good enough.

The girl disperces her chakra to the ground out the soles of her feet. A cloud of smoke appearing around her body as a result of utilizing the jutsu as the girl began to move at high speeds for her. Upon stopping the effects of the jutsu begin to kick in. Like a bad drug which feels good in the begining yet once the side effects kicks in then it's like a slap to the face.

With her vision blurry due to her eyes not being able she sits down and closes her eyes and tries to reajust herself. She sighs out loud remaining seated until she felt ready to get up again.* - Sun Nov 15 15:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..And you have not a reason to help Kirigakure either. - Tue Nov 17 11:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A psychopathic sycophant - concerned with your own motives and unconcerned to the plights of the people. - Tue Nov 17 11:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is quite selfish of you to demand my help, and then not even give thanks for me saving your life.~ - Tue Nov 17 11:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Shouldn't you be thankful that you're alive? - Tue Nov 17 11:18:49 2015
