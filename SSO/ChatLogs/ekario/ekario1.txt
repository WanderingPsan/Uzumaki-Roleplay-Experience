<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) takes a seat on the ground and crosses her legs. She also stares out into the open although she had no emotion showing in her face.  A yawn escapes her while she crosses her arms.

"Rather early, didn't think there would be anyone else out and about." she said almost in a whisper showing she was rather soft spoken.* - Tue Oct 27 11:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Home is loud so I found it ineffiencent to sleep there. Lots of shouting is bad for sleeping so I plan to sleep during the day once everyone is tired from the arguing. - Tue Oct 27 11:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Is that a constant thing? - Tue Oct 27 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes. - Tue Oct 27 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Perhaps schedule some missions for the night? - Tue Oct 27 11:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) stands up and dust her pants off. She begins moving closer towards the water until her feet were barely touching it. Her hands lifts up forming the seal of confrontation  She closes her eyes and relaxes completely before speaking softly."Suiton, Kirigakure no jutsu." she said.

The water begins moving and spiriling around her. While this happen it begins to turn into mist covering a small area for now. Mainly because she did not want to use a lot of her chakra and she was just trying to show off the technique in general.* - Wed Oct 28 13:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) maintains her chakra flow for a bit controlling it. She lets the mist slowly clear up however to end the jutsu. Mean while she nods her head up and down."Correct. Try to sneak up on someone while they can't see me and catch someone off guard. We are shinobi after all so avoiding up front fighting is always good right?"* - Wed Oct 28 13:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. There is no such thing as a dirty trick. - Wed Oct 28 13:37:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...All these wars. The death caused by it all. - Thu Oct 29 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: My father's will is against that. - Thu Oct 29 09:28:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It doesn't have to be that way. - Thu Oct 29 10:10:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We can change this. - Thu Oct 29 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Maybe. - Thu Oct 29 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well I don't mind helping if you need it. - Thu Oct 29 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Just a little. - Thu Oct 29 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Would you be up for a spar? - Thu Oct 29 10:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Thu Oct 29 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: However, before we do so, mind if I stock up on weapons? - Thu Oct 29 10:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Sure. I'll be here. - Thu Oct 29 10:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Sorry about that, got pulled into an argument. - Thu Oct 29 12:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: An argument of what? - Thu Oct 29 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: They found out I wasn't in then started yelling so then they focused on each other and I snuck away while they were doing so. - Thu Oct 29 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Do you still have time for that spar? - Thu Oct 29 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm not going back anytime soon. - Thu Oct 29 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I also decided to try my luck with a sword as well. - Thu Oct 29 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. You buy a Bokuto then? - Thu Oct 29 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Thu Oct 29 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. Just Kenjutsu then. - Thu Oct 29 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) adjusted her body holding her wooden boken in her hand. She never had any experience in sword play so she decided to try and mimic him. Considering the situation she had no intentions of trying to wind this spar at all. Considering it was just kenjutsu spar.

She breaths out knowing she was going to make the first move and she did. She took off moving towards him a fast as she could. Lifting her hands up she decided to perform a simple slow strike with the wooden sword hoping to clash it against his just to get a feel of what it was like to swing and hit something with it.

If she was successful she tries to put her guard back up and breath out for now.* - Thu Oct 29 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) tilted her boken to the side and tried holding her ground by guarding her chest area. She hums softly before jumpping back if she was successful. She shifted her body in a make shift stance before moving close again raising the wooden katana and shifting her body.

This time she tried putting some weight into her attack in order to experiment hoping to clash with his arms. She wanted to see the results of a strike with her weight behind it. Rather she succeeds or failed in a sloppy manner she tried to follow up with a horizantal strike hoping to connect with his side* - Thu Oct 29 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) was surprised how effective her attacks was. She didn't think that he'd struggle that much with each attack."I'm not heavy....so how was it that effective." she thought to herself after his speech. Her stance changed and she grip the boken with two hands instead of one which was a whole new kind of weird for her.

She takes a single step trying to think of something. Basic strikes to try and over whelm him."What if I..." she thought her arms moving up. Her body tenses up a bit for now while thoughts continue to run through her head on how to execute her plan of action.* - Thu Oct 29 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) decided not to dodge the attack but to counter attack during this time. With both her hands when he went for his strike she went for hers using her weight behind it once more. Her form was still sloppy and akward for her to take but she still figured out that two hands were better than one.

The strike connected with her and she aimed to connect with him. Only difference is the strength difference and speed. She hope the close range of the two left an opening for her to win this one. However she also hope that this wouldn't hurt him.

Breathing out if he was down on the ground she offered him her hand.* - Thu Oct 29 15:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: That actually work... - Thu Oct 29 15:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Evening. - Fri Oct 30 10:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How are you feeling? - Fri Oct 30 10:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I'm fine. - Fri Oct 30 10:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Don't worry about the spar from earlier. - Fri Oct 30 10:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright then. - Fri Oct 30 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: What are you doing? - Fri Oct 30 11:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I was about to practice some of my jutsus. - Fri Oct 30 11:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You too huh? - Fri Oct 30 11:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What're you working on? - Fri Oct 30 11:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Using less chakra when I create my mist while expanding it further. Killing two birds with one stone. - Fri Oct 30 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) shakes her head left and right."No I rather you tell me how dense and how far do you think it's stretching." she stats in a soft tone voice while holding up a single seal. She begins building up a large amount of chakra while focusing on the water causing it to sprial around in a circle between the two of them.

She closes her eyes to the mist that was being created and exhales out trying to expand it further. Wanting to cover a larger area while making it dense. She could not reach absolute zero vision however, she was still a rookie to the technique. 

With it being harder to see in the mist she opens her eyes and looks towards his direction. Clearing her throat she lowers her hands and breaths out before opening her mouth."What do you think? How is it coming along?" she ask in her soft tone voice.* - Fri Oct 30 11:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) with the mist created she tried to not only expand it but add a bit more chakra to it in order to make it dense. She breaths out wasting some of her chakra with her build up due to control issues. She did not want to over do it however and use up all of her chakra.

"And now?" she said trying to cover herself. It was a bit harder to see than before but still no where near enough. The mist hadn't expanded in range ether. What's worse is she was using to much chakra at this point.

Because of this the mist started clearing away. She awaited his answer before she stop struggling to hold onto the mist and let it fade away completely knowing she needed to work on using less chakra in general.* - Fri Oct 30 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Over all that's better then. Which is good. - Fri Oct 30 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. - Fri Oct 30 12:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'll rest up and practice again. Mean while what are you practicing? - Fri Oct 30 12:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) flashes back to what he said his elements were when he found out he was an Uchiha. It made sense for him to be able to use fire so this did not come as a surprise. Well the jutsu did but not the fact he knew some katon ninjutsu.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Meet him halfway? - Tue Nov  3 10:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You said it'll be harder for him to enter later, so the simple solution is for him to not have to enter. - Tue Nov  3 10:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You mean to stay on the outskirts of the village waiting for him?  - Tue Nov  3 10:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If he doesn't come that could be bad. And we'd still have to survive a few nights out there. - Tue Nov  3 10:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: At the same time we can't enter that village on our own. I've heard rumors that Sunagakure is attacking those not of authorized passage. - Tue Nov  3 11:00:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: That would be bad. - Wed Nov  4 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sunagakure would attack us for trying to enter. - Wed Nov  4 14:17:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Mm. We can't.  - Wed Nov  4 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not so much hiding just biding time in order to think of a new move. - Wed Nov  4 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And how long would we bide our time? - Wed Nov  4 14:31:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I know. I'm not saying to rush. - Wed Nov  4 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We can't do that. But biding our time may be an equally costly maneuver. - Wed Nov  4 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How so? - Wed Nov  4 15:32:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We can't go into the wilderness like that. - Wed Nov  4 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It could be a quick way to get killed if we don't know what we're doing. - Wed Nov  4 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But even if we do manage..it wouldn't be the right choice. - Wed Nov  4 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Got any suggestions? - Wed Nov  4 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We need to stay within Konoha or Suna. Depending on whether Fujitora pulls through. - Wed Nov  4 15:42:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: That might lead to them trying to kill us. - Wed Nov  4 15:44:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We can continue hiding out here and trying to send word to Fujitora...lay low as long as possible. - Wed Nov  4 15:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: In the mean time practice jutsu that doesn't damage the house. Does this place have running water? - Wed Nov  4 15:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) walked over towards the sink and turns it on. She places the stopper down and lets the sink fill up to the brim. Once she finished this Yumiko turns the water off and looks down at it."We can use this place to practice while we wait. We can use things that do not damage the house before we make our next move." she states now forming a single hand seal.

"Kirigakure no jutsu." she thought to herself making the water spin around in a spirial dispercing into a mist and spreading out slowly. She couldn't get a densed mist because of how much chakra that would cost but she did get a light one. That and she wasn't a master at the technique nor could she create water.

"Or if you can create water you could use it to fill up the sink next time and practice a jutsu such as that. Even do things to clean the house can attribute to practicing creating water." she said softly while maintaininig the light mist that wasn't dense enough to cover herself let alone the room.* - Wed Nov  4 16:20:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes but mask concealing our faces might draw people to think we're hiding something. - Wed Nov  4 16:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: So just stay in here and hope for Fujitora? - Wed Nov  4 16:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) lifts her hand up placing it o her chin. Clearly that could be advised. She didn't have a konohagakure head band or even one at all on. That and the other one was hidden in her shoe."Hmm that could work." she said while maintaining that mist she had created running through the pros and cons of the action.

"If I do that then you should burn my head band. Completely destory it just incase something bad happens and I get checked. Also incase things get bad then perhaps I should learn something else besides this mist technique." she thought looking around and begins to slow down the flow of her chakra dispercing the mist jutsu.

"Somethig that won't scream I'm from Kirigakure but a shinobi who was slacking off would be good so I could pass for a suiton user."* - Wed Nov  4 16:59:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Lots of messanger birds, one scroll. - Wed Nov  4 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Only the one? That gives this one message.. - Wed Nov  4 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: For now... - Wed Nov  4 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Lets send one. - Wed Nov  4 21:10:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Wed Nov  4 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A letter has returned. - Wed Nov  4 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) moves to the sink and fills it up once again. Since Heiwa was asleep and she didn't trust going outside she decided to get some practice in. Once the sink was full she lifts her hands up in the air forming the seal of confrontation.

"Kirigakure no jutsu." she thought to herself spreading the mist around making it light still not covering herself with the amount of water present. She shakes her head left and right thinking to herself."This is not enough. No where near enough." she thought deciding to try adding to the mist.

She opens her mouth focusing on the core of her stomach breathing out she tried creating her own mist. It was hard to do because she was only a novice with suiton in general but it was experience she needed after all. She breaths out creating a bit of the mist she needed but it still was not enough.

Because of this Yumiko knew what she should try working on. Creation of water was going to be her next project. She closes her mouth and stops breathing out so she would not use up to much chakra at the current time. Mean while Yumiko took a seat on the ground.

Once she did so the mist she maintain begins to fade away. She brings her chakra to a hault not wanting to over do it. For now she just rest up to regain her chakra until she felt ready to practice once more.* - Thu Nov  5 11:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) stands up deciding not to fill the sink up with water this time. Instead she went straight for the seal used for the jutsu. Once she did so Yumiko begins focusing on her core building up chakra begining to convert it into water.

Luckly for her this was a low ranking technique. A perfect technique for her to get use to creating water instead of one that was higher in rank. She breaths out the water creating what seemed like droplets at first. She was unable to turn it into mist instantly causing a bit of delay in the technique but this was something that couldn't be avoided for the time being.

"I guess having water around is better then creating water. This uses more chakra in return. A fine experiment for now." she thought to herself as the droplets of water she created was begining to spread out and turn into mist for the time being.

The amount of time it took to complete would have gotten her killed in a fight. For now Yumiko figured it was best to rely on something else until she gotten use to the element more. Not to say it wasn't effective around water but creation was a bit more difficult.* - Thu Nov  5 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) decided to try once more without a break. She could go on a little longer heading to the sink. She attempted to create a dense mist with the water she had. It'd look akward for now because of how little water she was using. Enough to cover her face at best.

Once she was finish she disperce the mist and sat down thinking over her results. Perhaps it was time for her to try something that had a little more offensive use to it. She breaths out crossing her legs sighing a bit and pulling out some milk drinking it. A way to mentally unwind and help regain her chakra.* - Thu Nov  5 11:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hey. - Thu Nov  5 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Evening. - Thu Nov  5 12:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Sleep well? - Thu Nov  5 12:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm..well enough.  - Thu Nov  5 12:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: What does the letter say? - Thu Nov  5 12:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Kiri isn't the only one having trouble. - Thu Nov  5 12:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sunagakure has found itself under attack as well. They're on high alert disallowing anyone in or out. - Thu Nov  5 12:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He stated for us to remain hidden from danger and to keep low in the shadows. - Thu Nov  5 12:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And wait for it to be over. - Thu Nov  5 12:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He also sent another note. All it says in big bold letters is: Deez Nuts. - Thu Nov  5 12:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I see. - Thu Nov  5 12:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I've been practicing a bit while you slept. - Thu Nov  5 12:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Decided to work on creating weak water jutsu without a source. - Thu Nov  5 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: As in your mouth instead of all around you? - Thu Nov  5 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: All around you as in the source. - Thu Nov  5 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes. - Thu Nov  5 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Although I don't want to try that with stronger techniques yet until I'm use to it. - Thu Nov  5 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see. Still working on Kenjutsu? - Thu Nov  5 13:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not as often as my suiton ninjutsu. - Thu Nov  5 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Up for a spar then? - Thu Nov  5 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright. - Thu Nov  5 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) look out the window and nodded  her head."Outside would be good. I actually wanted to try something which makes sparring outside a better choice." she states grabbing a boken and walking out.* - Thu Nov  5 13:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Here is good don't you think? - Thu Nov  5 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It should be. We're in a mostly abandoned district. - Thu Nov  5 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) nods her head and moves her hands. She did not reach for the boken but rather form a hand seal."This time I will be practicing using kenjutsu while using my mist at the sametime. I wish to test them together." she said while building up her chakra in front of him.

She opens her mouth taking quite a bit of time to prepare the jutsu. Naturally there was responce time for him to object if he desired but if he didn't she breaths out what seems to be a vapor substance. Converting the water droplets she created into mist she attempts to create a light mist around the area."Kirigakure no jutsu." she thought to herself considering the district was abandoned.

Once the mist was formed she took her boken out and tense her body up getting ready to begin. The mist wasn't dense enough for absolute zero visibility. She still needed to see after all. Of course this is assuming Heiwa didn't object.* - Thu Nov  5 13:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) remain still in the mist keeping it up. She breaths out trying to muffle her movements and taking off slower than he was. She was trying to track him through his movements getting a faint idea of where he was from the yelling of his statement.

She now takes her boken while on the move tensing her body up preparing for the inital engagement. She had more confidence in herself than when she first used it but still her over all sword play needed work. She took a guess where he was at first. Her eye sight being avarage but tried to use her hearing to her advantage more so as a way to work on it.

She then with both hands begin to attempt a strike with a sloppy kendo stance putting her weight behind the attack. However she was going to fall short due to her experience with sword play. At best it'd most likely nick the child if he did not avoid the attack.

Mean while Yumiko also maintain her chakra for the mist paying attention to her reserves trying to control them better and make the mist last longer keeping her breathing slow down for the moment.* - Thu Nov  5 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) did not suspect that while keeping the mist up in general. She stumble forward and jump away breathing out. She knew from that one clash this wouldn't go well unless she changed something quickly."He's improved...or he was holding back the other time. None the less." she thought to herself tossing the wooden boken in the air and form the seal of confrontation once more.

Adding more chakra to it she makes the mist more dense than before deciding to experiment using it and fighting without any sight at all. She picked up the boken and lowered her breathing once more assuming a sloppy stance than previously.* - Thu Nov  5 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not at all. - Thu Nov  5 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then I can't attack you and you can't attack me. Draw? - Thu Nov  5 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yes. - Thu Nov  5 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) haults her chakra flow dispercing the mist before heading inside sighing at how much chakra she ended up using.* - Thu Nov  5 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) moves closer deciding to read the message with her own eyes wondering why he was frowning. An audible sigh escapes her lips when she went to read it.* - Thu Nov  5 17:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Who is this person...? - Thu Nov  5 17:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I think I met her in Konoha once. - Thu Nov  5 17:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And she was in Kiri a week before the disaster happened. - Thu Nov  5 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Threat? - Thu Nov  5 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I don't think so. - Thu Nov  5 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The blood in the note..concerns me. - Thu Nov  5 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Yeah... - Thu Nov  5 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) leans back against the wall sighing deeply and sliding down it.* - Thu Nov  5 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Seems she followed to Konoha though. - Thu Nov  5 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And there is a tournament here.. - Thu Nov  5 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Can we trust her? - Thu Nov  5 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If anything I think she'd do more harm to herself than to any of us. - Thu Nov  5 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...She spent a few hours standing in pose pretending to be a statue. - Thu Nov  5 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: So she's one of those types. - Thu Nov  5 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You want to go find her? - Thu Nov  5 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Maybe. - Thu Nov  5 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Well, if I can't leave, that'd leave it up to you to find her. - Thu Nov  5 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She's a bit older than us, but not an adult. - Thu Nov  5 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Red hair. - Thu Nov  5 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...If the personality doesn't tip you off that should. - Thu Nov  5 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Evening. - Fri Nov  6 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Sleep well? - Fri Nov  6 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov  6 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You? - Fri Nov  6 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm.. - Fri Nov  6 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It was...fine.  - Fri Nov  6 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You up for another spar soon? Once you wake up. - Fri Nov  6 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov  6 12:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Then I'll go find that girl. - Fri Nov  6 12:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'll be outside. When you've woken up come outside. - Fri Nov  6 13:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: The needed sleep was great. - Fri Nov  6 15:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. You awake enough? - Fri Nov  6 15:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov  6 16:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) reaches back to the wooden boken and holds it trying to improve her stance. She leaves it in one hand for now assuming a one handed stance instead of a two handed strike."I am." she said.* - Fri Nov  6 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) waited for him to approch not shifting her stance at all. She studied his movement carefully taking full note of how he was improving and how fast he was then compared to how he was moving now.  She knew that attempted to go toe to toe with him was going to be hard so she had to attack in a manner he probably wouldn't suspect.

The wooden sword came and her left hand shoots out aiming to grab his arm right with the boken connected to her side. She grunted as the attack connected but hopefully it was going to be time to trade attacks with him now since he went for a frontal assasult.

With the boken in her other hand she lifts it up while Heiwa was close and twisted her right foot on an angle. If one thing she learned while practicing sword play it's putting your weight behind something was generally a better route to go instead of just simply swinging with just your arm strength.

She leans to put some of her weight behind a strike to his shoulder hoping to connect with the wooden boken in an attempt to deliver what could be consider a power blow for a six year old. Obviously wouldn't hurt an adult because even with stats she's six. But she hope to get the better end of a deal with this exchange.* - Fri Nov  6 16:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) took note at her attack being stopped and enter in what seemed to look like a struggle. Her eye look to the wooden sword for a split second and notice she couldn't move it. Yumiko remain calm and ran a lot of ideas through her head of what to do next until it suddenly hit her.

"If this was a real fight what would happen. Hmm." she thought in that moment she notice that the grappling struggle was initatied and then found her solution. This was the first time she was put in this situation but at the sametime she learn something important from the experience. She focused on her grappling hand to try and keep Heiwa still before twisting her body the other way aiming for a round house kick to his side trying to put some weight behind it.

From there one of two things was next depending on if she succeeded or not. If this made Heiwa let go of her other arm she tries to swing the wooden boken again on his shoulder incorperating hand to hand with sword play. However if he didn't she pull him back closer to her and try to knee him in the stomach with her right knee.* - Fri Nov  6 17:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Feeling alright? - Fri Nov  6 18:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) yawn out loud standing up and stretching. She decided to try something since she had bee working on her control. Forming a single hand seal she decided to try and move from one place to another utilizing shunshin. The results were the disorientation from hell.

With just that she needed a break. She didn't realize how chakra taxing that was on her reserves. She needed to sit her ass down from the stamina and chakra loss she just recieved.* - Sat Nov  7 12:11:44 2015

Yet all you do is walk these grounds as a mere host to a empty soul. Don't you -dare- pass judgment on me for at least I'm doing something with my life.
