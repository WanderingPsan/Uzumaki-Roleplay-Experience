<br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In the mean time, Tengoku, lets go get ready. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Are we going to go train? - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alrighty. - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. We are if you three are ready. - Tue Dec  1 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) shakes her head begining to walk off.* - Tue Dec  1 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: ...I don't know that word he just used. - Tue Dec  1 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Maybe I should start off? - Tue Dec  1 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Go ahead. - Tue Dec  1 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) shook her head left and right finally snapping back to reality. She was late but she took a step forward and cleared her throat."Yumiko, chuunin. For my abilities I mainly use my bow in fights." she said although that was partly a lie as Heiwa and Nori both would know.* - Tue Dec  1 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes, Sekitsui? - Tue Dec  1 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: The medic. - Tue Dec  1 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Precisely. - Tue Dec  1 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori is the primary person to protect in most situations. - Tue Dec  1 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Other exceptions exist, such as a mission built around protecting a person, or a position where ones skills are suddenly elevated beyond where Nori's are useful - but in the most case our work will be cut out on protecting Nori while finishing our actions. - Tue Dec  1 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And this is why we've brought Tengoku here. - Tue Dec  1 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Please, if you would, step up. - Tue Dec  1 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Because of his speed and use of shunshin? - Tue Dec  1 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Closer, stand beside me. - Tue Dec  1 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The three of you are on a mission. I've been seperated from the group. - Tue Dec  1 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: What does Heiwa have planned? - Tue Dec  1 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You see the faint outline of a rogue shinobi infront of you.  - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ... - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You have one minute to get into position. - Tue Dec  1 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Protect Nori, disable Tengoku, however you choose to play it. - Tue Dec  1 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Oi.~ A mock mission encounter? - Tue Dec  1 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: This is gonna be over rather quickly. I'll try to last as long as I could against them. - Tue Dec  1 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'll just say this. - Tue Dec  1 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If I tap you, let's say you've been assassinated. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Just for the sake of the training. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Have one better. - Tue Dec  1 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Wait, what? - Tue Dec  1 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I can still uh. . Defend myself though. . Right? - Tue Dec  1 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ...Interesting. - Tue Dec  1 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) didn't want to take any chances since she knew how fast Tengoku was in general when it came to using shunshin first. She heard that they had to protect Nori and decided to go with the old stratagy to try and prevent Nori from being targeted. She formed the seal of confrontation when Sekitsui begins to move.

"Kirigakure no jutsu." she thought to herself aiming to take away his sight while begining to move on her own. She hope Nori would get the hint and move herself but for now she just focused on creating the mist to try and blind his sight while Sekitsui used her nose to track him in order to make this mock battle a bit more fun. Question is what was Yumiko planning?* - Tue Dec  1 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Why did I do that if I can't see? - Tue Dec  1 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) maintains the mist for now but weaved together a few more hnd seals. She holds her breath now hoping to avoid detection by breath. Once she got to where she was heading she suddenly stopped but kept the mist up. She wanted to give Nori more time to move after all and not be an open target while setting up for something else.

Mean while she could hear a bit of noise but couldn't track it. She couldn't tell who it was fron but thank god it was from the dog. Yumiko herself kneels down to the ground while getting ready."Just a bit longer." she thought to herself.* - Tue Dec  1 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) begins to make the mist lighter and lighter until it one could see completely again. She wasn't sure where he was and needed to spot him quickly to go on the offensive. She however did this for a reason and it as time for her to go on the attack."I hope you hid yourself Nori." she thought to herself while continuing to mold chakra.

Once she could see again she thought one thing to herself."Chains of Absolution." with the hand signs already made for it previously and her hand touching the ground Yumiko was just waiting most the time for Nori's sake since she one of the objectives was to protect Nori since she is the medic. 

Hoping to catch him off guard with the sudden attack Yumiko aim to bind Tengoku's legs once the mist cleared. If she did fail then at least Sekitsui could also use her eyes to fight against him or possibly even come to her aid if she needed it.* - Tue Dec  1 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) step out from behind the tree and look towards Heiwa."Let him out?" she said begining to hault her chakra flow to let him out. She then clears her throat turning her head back to Tengoku and keeping her eyes on him just incase.* - Tue Dec  1 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If this was on me would any of you be the wiser? - Tue Dec  1 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The technique itself could hinder you in many ways. - Tue Dec  1 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Be careful with that jutsu, Yumiko. - Tue Dec  1 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I would have acted differently, I only use it to make it harder to shunshin an attack as quickly as he could since Nori could have been the first target of such a stratagy. - Tue Dec  1 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Paper* - Tue Dec  1 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . Can I come out now?! - Tue Dec  1 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes. You can come out. - Tue Dec  1 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Perhaps. Not every hostage will be a shinobi, however. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not every hostage will be capable of stating they're tagged.  - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Around near any person it's a good idea to be careful. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Or develop some sensory ability. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: The situation was saving -you-, our squad leader. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Not a civilian. - Tue Dec  1 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Yeah, I screwed over your little lesson. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Nice try though. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This time - don't worry. Feeling around me would have been a mistake. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It wasn't a chastisement of you. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The lesson itself was rigged against Yumiko's usage of that technique. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: I don't see why her using the technique was a bad thing. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's strong. Invaluable even. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: I don't understand. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But it can have detriments. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Collateral..unintentional actions or results - the use of the mist blinds us as shinobis from being able to react. - Tue Dec  1 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ....oh that jutsu? - Tue Dec  1 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I thought you meant the other one. - Tue Dec  1 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Tengoku, you aren't hurt, right? - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Yes - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: No. - Tue Dec  1 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: I feel like I could have fotten murdered in that mist. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: You're lucky you moved. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I was about to knock you out. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah. - Tue Dec  1 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: OOC OFF - Tue Dec  1 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Having her train against Yumiko or Nori could be hard. She'd likely even be capable of being me too. Especially in Taijutsu. - Tue Dec  1 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Her using that jutsu helped me. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: But I mean, she didn't know it would. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Just worked out. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. Your sense of hearing synergized well. - Tue Dec  1 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Similar to mine. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: No, smell. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I smelled him. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: And you. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oh? - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Again - interesting. - Tue Dec  1 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You'll work well in the team then. Only one who still has difficulty from what I've seen if Nori herself.~ - Tue Dec  1 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Thanks. - Tue Dec  1 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We'll do some together, but much of that is reliant on you personally. - Tue Dec  1 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm okay. - Tue Dec  1 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah . . . Wait, difficulty in what? - Tue Dec  1 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Finding your way around the mist. - Tue Dec  1 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh, uh. . That kinda. . wasn't something I expected. - Tue Dec  1 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: If only Nori ran my way. - Tue Dec  1 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I didn't know where you were. .! - Tue Dec  1 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which was the problem in its use.  - Tue Dec  1 06:13:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Ah I didn't even know you were watching. - Tue Dec  1 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Yeah....I don't have a very active squad..So I figured I'd just watch you guys... - Tue Dec  1 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Sorry they changed you off our squad - Tue Dec  1 06:32:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You could always train with us at times. - Tue Dec  1 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: I guess..I wouldn't want to intrude though. - Tue Dec  1 06:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We're shinobi of the same village.~ - Tue Dec  1 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Doesn't bother me any. - Tue Dec  1 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Plus I already asked Anguo to train me too, he isn't on my squad. - Tue Dec  1 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Hmm..Alrighty... - Tue Dec  1 06:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm, mhm.~ Very. - Tue Dec  1 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's a nice team, but Nori you need to find ways around in the mist. - Tue Dec  1 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm.  . I mean. . If I can't see, then I can always hear? - Tue Dec  1 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Right? - Tue Dec  1 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You also need to learn some physical and range combat... - Tue Dec  1 07:01:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well. I was interested in learning fuuinjutsu. - Tue Dec  1 07:18:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I see. - Tue Dec  1 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Well, if I get into it. .  But that's probably after I finish a lot of my medic training. - Tue Dec  1 07:34:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) holds her bow up towards Nori and begins building up chakra. She looks back and fourth between Nori and Sekitsui humming. Nori was closer and Sekitsui was further away. Still being afraid of how close Nori was she decided to target Sekitsui first. 

Turning her body she applied shape manipulation to her bow before firing it towards Sekitsui. Sadly however her aim was quite off which went to the side of the girl.* - Wed Dec  2 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) also went on the move once she saw Sekitsui move as well.This allowed her to get some more distance from Nori as well. Following the girl but not as fast as she moved Yumiko prepared for another shot. Building up chakra and molding it once more.

She then decided to target Sekitsui's leg with the arrow. Still not being on target but she had a lucky shot this time. This arrow most likely graze her leg. Sometimes people do get lucky after all.* - Wed Dec  2 05:16:35 2015

She was quiet but she built up chakra none the less.

An arrow was sent to Nori aimed at her side. It was aim there but she shot passed Nori missing the girl completely. After the shot Yumiko began to build up chakra while taking aim once more at Nori even if her head turned to Sekitsui every once in a while.* - Wed Dec  2 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) decided to give Sekitsui a break for now and focus on Nori. Needless to say she didn't lucky this time ether.

Yumiko ask lowering the bow for now.* - Wed Dec  2 06:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) moves into one of the room and pulls out some paint and pencils. She opens the scroll while taking a good while to complete what she was doing. Oddly enough she wasn't making a mess. She dislikes messes but what ever it was Yumiko was really concentrating on it. She seem to be off in her own world for the time being.

While making the symbol for the name she decided to make it more than just regular black since that would be boring. She took care of mostly every detail. However there were some screw ups in what she made. Some area such as the bottom wasn't really outlined or given depth. A sigh came out of her mouth since she wasn't the type to really dwell on mistakes such as that.

Once she was finished she scoots back and folds her legs."Come look." she said holding the picture out. "A symbol to show our goal."* - Wed Dec  2 10:00:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If we're to do..what we need to do - we need to get as strong as possible. - Wed Dec  2 10:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Wed Dec  2 10:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I think I've almost gotten the iron maiden down. - Wed Dec  2 10:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: No. - Wed Dec  2 10:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Good. We're best off taking that out of the archives. - Wed Dec  2 10:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Our personal hidens. - Wed Dec  2 10:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not many people know everything I can do. - Wed Dec  2 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm..that's good..showing your cards too quickly can destroy your entire fighting ability as a shinobi. - Wed Dec  2 11:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) heads to the top of the waterfall deciding to get the vantage point again. She really like high places after all. She looks down at the water and sits her bow down for now. Taking in the sight for a bit Yumiko gazes at her reflection. A sigh of relief escapes the young girl. 

Deciding to get down to business she lifts her hands up weaving together the hand seals she needed. A statue appears rising from the ground under the water below. Yumiko spoke."Kuchiyose, Iron maiden." while the statue came up. Yumiko picks up her bow and gets ready to try striking her target.

She holds her bow up in a single hand. Since this bow had no string she only needed one arm which made making a stance easier for her.Taking aim not even having to pull a string she fired an arrow to the arm of the statue she summon which collided against it. She seem to be able to hit big targets at least. 

Preparing another shot she decided to try and hit the side of the arm of the statue. Another success luckly for her. She seem to be improving with her bow having used it in actual combat and training. Results were begining to show finally.* - Wed Dec  2 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) sits her bow down and weaved together hand seals deciding to practice her chakra control in a different way. Chains wrap around the statue but the statue did not head back down in the ground like it usually did. Yumiko herself had an idea of what she could try but the task alone was going to be difficult.

From under the statue chains begin to rise from the ground and try to wrap around it. This was pretty difficult due to the size of the statue and the fact Yumiko was trying not to use as much chakra as usual to create the chains but ended up having to. While focusing she exhales eventually wrapping them around it.

The statue then begins sinking back into the ground and with it the chains did as well. Yumiko who used quite a bit of chakra for that took a seat once more and breaths out."Think this works better on people then larger things for now.." she said softly.* - Wed Dec  2 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Evening. - Wed Dec  2 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hey. You need some rest still? - Wed Dec  2 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Just a little more. - Wed Dec  2 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm - we're going to work on your accuracy today, alright?  - Wed Dec  2 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright. - Wed Dec  2 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Did you ask her about "that"? - Wed Dec  2 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Her about what? - Wed Dec  2 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oh - Nori? - Wed Dec  2 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I haven't. - Wed Dec  2 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mmm. - Wed Dec  2 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Tonight, okay? - Wed Dec  2 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright. - Wed Dec  2 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In the mean time we need to work on your archery.~ - Wed Dec  2 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Heh yeah. - Wed Dec  2 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Okay. - Wed Dec  2 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) pulls her bow out and aims it at him. She builds her chakra up nodding her head deciding to try something. This was going to go horribly wrong but it would put his sight to the test. There was more than one way to shoot a target.

An arrow was formed on the bow and her arm rises up. With the bow now pointing on an angle in the air Yumiko releases the arrow into the air aiming to see if the arrow was going to fall on his shoulder. Of course she held the power back a lot. Sadly the arrow was not falling on him but rather a few feet in front of him.* - Thu Dec  3 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) took note of where the arrow went and adjusted her aim a bit. She lifted the bow higher than before channeling chakra into it and forming another arrow and shooting it off in the sky letting the arrow fly. 

Not even taking time to wait for the arrow to hit or miss which the arrow did the latter heading an inch away from that right foot of his Yumiko brings the bow down aiming at Heiwa once more. She planned to make things a bit more interesting now.* - Thu Dec  3 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) didn't move her feet but her arms was a different story. With no string on the arrow she had nothing to pull back. Instead she builds up her chakra once again trying to track Heiwa's movement. This time she intended to try and cut him off but she also held back the power to prevent him from needing a medical shinobi if her arrow did hit.

She fired another arrow instantly to keep him on his toes. This one wasn't on an arc like the other one. This was shot like a normal arrow. A simple stratagy but effective. This arrow was aim to slide pass Heiwa's arm. Even if her intention was to hit it directly her aim still was pretty fucked up. At least she was getting better.* - Thu Dec  3 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) gave him a second and built up her chakra once more. She decided to move while doing so at the sametime. Trying to pick up speed she shoots the arrow towards Heiwa's leg this time this time actually getting lucky and having a pretty decent aim. 

Her aim adjust while holding her bow upwards again, and yet she suddenly stop and spoke on her radio to say hello to Nori.* - Thu Dec  3 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I think you should get some rest. Don't want to really hurt you with this. - Thu Dec  3 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: She is yes. - Thu Dec  3 04:29:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) step out the house and began to head east. She yawned while walking seeming without much of a care. She was heading to  her usual spot now deciding to get a little practice in while having an idea to try out. Once she got there she head up  near the waterfall. 

Walking off to the side the girl decided to put her idea to use. She lifted her hands up and went through a series of hand seals. Her head looks down at the ground and she flows her chakra up her stomach to her mouth. Her cheeks puff 
outwards getting ready for the jutsu. The one thought ran through her head."Water style Syrup Trap." 

Her mouth open and just like how a waterfall flows down she let her jutsu flow downwards trying to make as big of a field as possible. Step one of getting use to the jutsu was to see the potentional of the jutsu. For herself being new to the 
technique the jutsu used quite a bit of chakra. 

The girl maintains the flow for a while and the constant stream of chakra. That was until she needed a breather. Her flow slows down haulting completely. She breaths out catching her breath before making the hand seals again. This time 
deciding to work with less chakra than the amount she did before.

Her heads tilted back down and she did utilize the jutsu but it was much weaker than before. Her ability with suiton was showing still being able to utilize the jutsu even with less chakra, but her lack of experience with control due to her 
time as a shinobi only being a year also showed. Yumiko herself noticed the jutsu being weaker than it was and decided to work on the flaw.

Cutting the chakra flow once more the girl took a break. She sat down and had time to think it over wonderng what she did wrong with the second time. "Could it just been inexperience with the jutsu or could it have been improper use of control?" those were the questions running through her mind. After thinking about it for a while Yumiko got up again. She had an idea she wanted to try out.

With the repeated hand seals she strings them together quick as possible. However with her build up she took her time. She kept the flow constant while picturing a wider field. Taking more preperation time she made more of the sticky liquid instead of rushing it. Then she released the technique aiming down as if she was creating a waterfall of it. This time she was more pleased with her performance. She decided to stop for now however.* - Thu Dec  3 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) took a seat and began to rest. With dumplings,milk and water by her side she decided to eat alone today to help regain some chakra. She had three bottles of milk and one bottle of water which she consumed with her dumplings.* - Thu Dec  3 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) stands back up deciding to continue practicing. She weaved together hands seals once more taking what she learned previous to heart when building up her chakra. Finding this more effective her usage of the technique saved her the hassle of wasting to much for the same result. Preparing it well enough so her output was great without the waste she thought one thing to herself. "Water style: Syrup Trap!"

Her head tilts down and with the technique she added onto the previous technique over top of it making quite the mess. She maintains the flow trying to go for as long as she could. Her flow slowing down trying to use less chakra thinking about long drawn out fights. She was preparing for something after all which might required it and as a stratagist she was thinking a head.

Once she was finish due to needing a breather she haults her flow stopping. She sits down again to think over the results of what she just did.* - Thu Dec  3 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh. - Thu Dec  3 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hi.~ - Thu Dec  3 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hiya! - Thu Dec  3 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: What'cha doing? - Thu Dec  3 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well. - Thu Dec  3 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I've been practicing this suiton technique trying to control my chakra better. - Thu Dec  3 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Want to see? - Thu Dec  3 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I'm game. Sure. - Thu Dec  3 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Wait, you're gonna hit me with it or. .? - Thu Dec  3 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) shakes her head left and right while walking to the edge of the waterfall."Of course not." she said lifting her hands up going through a series of hand seals. She brings her hand to her mouth taking time to build up chakra. Inhaling in the mean time she converts her chakra to an odd substance.

Her cheeks puff up and she unleashes the technique down into the water. From the way it look one could tell it was an odd substance her chakra made. It continues to flow down theside getting on the ledge."Water style Syrup trap." she thought to herself while it continued flowing down.

She slowly stops her chakra flow before haulting it. Her lips parted when she began to speak."This technique is for capturing purposes. Think like the chains except they have to run on it in order to be caught in it. With this it can be hard to get in close to you." she said out loud explaining the technique.* - Thu Dec  3 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) shakes her head left and right. In all truthfullness she didn't know how one could get out of it, but as far as she knew no one could get out of it once they were caught in it. The problem is just catching someone in it."Not at all. Once they're stuck they're stuck. If you fall on it then good luck getting out." she states.

Once she stop shaking her head she shuffles through the hand seals once more. Lifting her hand up to her mouth she utilized the technique again. Each time trying to learn how to waste less chakra and improve her control over her chakra in general incase a long drawn out fight happens. 

The added syrup piles on top of the amount she had before hand. A few moments ater she stops sighing out loud and sitting down further away from the liquid so she didn't get stuck to it. Getting stuck to your own jutsu sucks after all.* - Thu Dec  3 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I think so. - Thu Dec  3 19:34:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) runs to hop on Nori's back.* - Thu Dec  3 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) looks out the corner of her eye taking note Ryo. She only watched him for now not saying anything until she saw the flamethrower shoot out from hirs mouth. She instantly reconized the jutsu due to seeing it before."Ah that technique, but then..." she thought to herself taking note of how he looked afterwords. The panting and gasping made one thing clear. It took it's toll on his body.

"Quite a lot of chakra you used there." she said out loud breaking her silence.* - Thu Dec  3 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Taijutsu is good but when you fight someone long range it becomes bad thing. I know this. - Thu Dec  3 22:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: One that's out of the village.~ - Thu Dec  3 23:28:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: No we were waiting for you. - Fri Dec  4 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see. Well, I'm not sure if the Mizukage is up right now. Do you want to look? - Fri Dec  4 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Yeah, let's go!~ - Fri Dec  4 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Come one Nori! - Fri Dec  4 01:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We're going to ask about a mission! Come on - and bring Yumiko with you too! - Fri Dec  4 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaake uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup! - Fri Dec  4 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Alright, alright I'm coming! - Fri Dec  4 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Hmph. - Fri Dec  4 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Seems she's busy. - Fri Dec  4 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I still have some low ranking missions you three could go on and take the credit for - but I doubt you'd all want that. - Fri Dec  4 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Hm... it's okay. - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I'll wait. - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Maybe training or no? - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. Training can work - I have an idea in mind anyways. - Fri Dec  4 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Lets head out to the fields. - Fri Dec  4 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Alrighty.~ - Fri Dec  4 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright. This spot should do. We'll be working on some physical training later on in the day, but with all things there is a balance needed. - Fri Dec  4 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A strong body is nothing without a strong mind. - Fri Dec  4 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Sekitsui, Yumiko, Nori - Can either of you explain what a genjutsu is?  - Fri Dec  4 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I hope that's not taken as condescending. - Fri Dec  4 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Jutsu that affect the mind only? - Fri Dec  4 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: It's a chakra attack on the brain. - Fri Dec  4 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mhm. It's a type of jutsu that affects the mind - not the physical realm - through application of chakra on the nervous system of the brain causing the recipient's senses to reflect what the user intends for them to see. - Fri Dec  4 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In other words - what you've both said. It's not used by many as they favor the use of frontal attacks. - Fri Dec  4 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: As it cannot kill it is often seen better to use a more physical sense of combat. - Fri Dec  4 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: However, you may very well find someone who does use genjutsu. In that case are any of you aware of how to counteract that? - Fri Dec  4 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: . . . What if we are in a genjutsu right now? And this village isn't real? - Fri Dec  4 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Good question..There are some ways to discern whether you're in a genjutsu or not. - Fri Dec  4 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A genjutsu only affects the senses - it does not affect the world around you. Low leveled genjutsus often will have tells because of this. - Fri Dec  4 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If, say, a giant ball of fire is made and is hurling towards you? - Fri Dec  4 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But you can visibly see a large body of water appearing still cool to the touch and not reacting in any way against it? - Fri Dec  4 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Of course, a strong enough genjutsu user would make you perceive that body of water also being boiling. - Fri Dec  4 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Staying aware of your senses can keep you from falling into the traps of a genjutsu. - Fri Dec  4 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm going to use a low level genjutsu on you. Your objective is to dissipate it using only your chakra. - Fri Dec  4 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: What are the handseals though? - Fri Dec  4 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The tiger hand seal. - Fri Dec  4 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Take a breather - we'll be working on some sparring in just a bit. - Fri Dec  4 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Your opponent will be Nori. - Fri Dec  4 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Oh. - Fri Dec  4 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Okay.~ - Fri Dec  4 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: When you both are ready step up and take opposing positions. - Fri Dec  4 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: After the seal of confrontation you can begin. - Fri Dec  4 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Can I go? - Fri Dec  4 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Oh - sure. - Fri Dec  4 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori and Yumiko then. - Fri Dec  4 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) nods moving and stretching out.* - Fri Dec  4 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Taijutsu, kenjutsu, shurikenjutsu - the limiting factors of this spar. - Fri Dec  4 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Stick to use of those. - Fri Dec  4 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm right. - Fri Dec  4 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm - actually, Yumiko, while Nori rests up from her..experience.. - Fri Dec  4 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: You know how to counter a genjutsu, yes? - Fri Dec  4 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) shakes her head left and right.* - Fri Dec  4 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Two methods. Pain can overwhelm the senses. As a Genjutsu focuses on changing what the senses perceive  this resets them. - Fri Dec  4 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: In doing so it breaks the illusion. - Fri Dec  4 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Alternatively, the method we were working on earlier, involves using chakra to dislodge the chakra put on the brain by the opponent. - Fri Dec  4 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: As Genjutsu works by attacking the chakra nervous system it disrupts the senses. Dislodging this breaks the genjutsu as well. - Fri Dec  4 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: To do this - you need an overwhelming amount of force. This is achieved by lowering your chakra and then surging it back up to normal. - Fri Dec  4 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: I'm going to put you in a very weak genjutsu, okay? Make the tiger seal and focus your chakra to break out of the genjutsu using dissipation. - Fri Dec  4 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Lets move away for a bit so things don't look weird. - Fri Dec  4 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori, rest up. We'll be back in a moment. - Fri Dec  4 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) takes his hand and heads off.* - Fri Dec  4 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) shakes her head while watching him utilize the two sets of seals. Watching intensely she took note of her surroundings. Her eyes shot open once she saw the sun go down. Then she knew the illusion was starting since her mind was being influenced by him.

She formed a single hand seal beginning to lower her chakra in preperation. In the mean time even knowing it was just a genjutsu she was shaken up quite a bit. Her breathing rate was increasing showing this as well. Clearly the genjutsu was taking it toll on the girl due to what she was seeing even if it was distorted.

"No..." she said seeing the what look like her entire squad dead. Minus the fact they were distorted to hell and back. She also look down to see herself covered in their blood as if it was poured on her by the ones who killed them. What look like a distorted demon also appeared. Hearing the words"And this will happen to everyone who gets close to you." her mental demon said to her laughing.

In order to deal with this Yumiko closed her eyes and shook her head left and right. Thank god Heiwa wasn't going all out on the poor girl. She serge her chakra suddenly releasing it with quite a force to dispel the genjutsu done on her. Using a lot more chakra than needed due to being shaken up. She breaths out opening her eyes and sitting down taking a look at her surroundings.

"I did it." she manage to say yet a single tear dropped due to her holding back crying. Clearly she did not want to go through that one again. A sigh escapes her afterwards eventually getting back up on her feet.* - Fri Dec  4 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's okay..It wasn't real, right? - Fri Dec  4 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Not at all... - Fri Dec  4 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: ..Good. You still..okay for the spar? - Fri Dec  4 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: What did she see..? - Fri Dec  4 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Fri Dec  4 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright.. - Fri Dec  4 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori, you ready as well? - Fri Dec  4 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. - Fri Dec  4 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Lets head back. - Fri Dec  4 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Sooo. . Spar, right? - Fri Dec  4 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Physical spar only. - Fri Dec  4 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm? Alright. - Fri Dec  4 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) tosses her bow to the side and makes a come here motion to Nori before holding up the seal of confrontation.* - Fri Dec  4 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) once Nori took off she herself took off running backwards. Seems like she was trying to keep her distance despite it being a close combat fight. She pulls out a bottle of milk begining to sip it while moving backwards thinking about what Heiwa said at the begining of the fight.* - Fri Dec  4 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) suddenly stop and went forward at full speed. She was only sipping the milk for a reason. Because she planned on giving the rest to Nori after all. Moving the bottle of milk she tried splashing it on her face specifically her eyes. She was not rude enough to throw the bottle at her of course.

Hoping her plan succeeded and that Heiwa didn't mind milk no jutsu she reached Nori aiming to try and shoulder ram her before sending an uppercut aimed at her chin.

* - Fri Dec  4 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) reaches down grabbing some dirt as well. While Nori rubbed her eyes from the milk assault Yumiko aim to continue the assault. She decided to kick Nori's side holding back her strength a bit when doing so. How odd this seems more like a school yard brawl than a taijutsu fight.* - Fri Dec  4 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) threw the dirt she picked up in Nori's face probably making quite the mess. First milk and now dirt? That was going to need to be washed off eventually. Yumiko jumps trying to pin Nori down and give them a head butt as hard as she could also feeling a bit of pain from it.* - Fri Dec  4 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) rolled off a bit stunned and blinded by the dirt once she learned what Nori's fist felt like.She closed her right eye and decided to back off a bit rubbing it hoping to get the dirt out of it.Mean while she moved back for a moment to try and regain her composure and think of her next move breathing out."Might have lost my edge there." she thought to herself.* - Fri Dec  4 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) decided to counter attack once Nori went for the head butt. However she was using her own head just not in that way. She jerked her hand up trying to use the knuckle of her other hand to attack Nori's other eye using the motion of Nori's own attack against her. Not to permently damage it or anything, just to temporary take away their sight from the attack. "Ow ow ow." she thought to herself.* - Fri Dec  4 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I'M SO HIGH RIGHT NOOOOOW *omit* - Fri Dec  4 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) actually had no intentions of continuing since she didn't like seriously hurting allies. She did however jerked her hand out only to pull Nori closer holding her. Normally she'd give the seal of reconciliation first but she figured Nori's well being was more important than that at the moment. She simply held onto her hugging Nori.* - Fri Dec  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) tried keeping her still even if it might have seem futile.Even she was begining to free out a bit."Uh uh ice! Yeah someone go get some ice!" she shouted that being the only thing that went through her mind.* - Fri Dec  4 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) takes the ice and tries placing it on Nori's eye hoping to numb the pain."Come on...come on..." she thought to herself knowing how cold the ice was.* - Fri Dec  4 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oooh.. . - Fri Dec  4 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) whispers: Shh it'll be okay, it'll be okay. - Fri Dec  4 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: I think. - Fri Dec  4 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ..Was she enjoying it all along? - Fri Dec  4 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How are you feeling now? - Fri Dec  4 07:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . Nuummb. . *muffled groan* - Fri Dec  4 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) removes the ice pack.* - Fri Dec  4 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Sorry. - Fri Dec  4 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Bad hurts. . - Fri Dec  4 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Want to head to the house? - Fri Dec  4 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I can get her head if you get her feet. - Fri Dec  4 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: We could take her arms and walk. - Fri Dec  4 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Well..how about Nori? - Fri Dec  4 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . . . Bad hurts. . - Fri Dec  4 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) stands up getting Nori by one of their arms and picks them up struggling a bit.* - Fri Dec  4 07:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How do you feel? - Fri Dec  4 08:08:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I messed up. - Fri Dec  4 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Huh? - Fri Dec  4 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Didn't mean to hurt her like that. - Fri Dec  4 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's no worse than what they would do on a mission. - Fri Dec  4 09:32:35 2015
