<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Innocents. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Entered the village together. Joked together. Spent most of your time with them. They were allowed passage no doubt under your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You may seek for a scapegoat, but you'll find it hard for me to fit that role. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They weren't Shinobi or villagers of this place. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They were allowed here upon the passage of your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Isn't that simply Kirigakure's fault? - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Their lax security allowed two unidentified shinobi to linger.. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: As I've said my pet, Shiro was the only one I was looking after. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Shiro has a bodyguard which was the other male. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That bodyguard is not under my protection. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then it is under the protection of Shiro. Meaning Shiro is to blame. - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: However, if Shiro is to blame, and you're to blame for what Shiro does, then that means, transitively, that you're to blame for him. - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh? - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Try as you might to blame me for his troubles, but I do doubt that Shiro ordered that man to commit the acts he did. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. You're Shiro's. And Shiro is the caretaker of that man. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She is not responsible for what he does off the clock. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If he is allowed passage within the village due to the requirement of being her bodyguard - then yes, she is. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Let me put it this way.. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you failed to stop me, is it right to blame you for my acts? - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That is a false analogy. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I am not in any way the person that allowed you within the village through our laws. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If I snuck you into the village ignoring the guards? - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: But you allowed me to murder. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So you've acknowledged that I'm here.. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yet..you allowed me to do what I have done. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And just what have you done? - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Just as it is out of your power to stop my hypothetical scenario. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh..murder people in that scenario. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The difference is that Heiwa would stop you there. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There wouldn't be any pinning to blame for me. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Unless you stop me before I take a life.. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is still a loss for you. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Luckily, I am a priest. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The big difference here that you're forgetting - I don't have ties with you. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You do. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You can be a psychopath just like Ichirou and Kida. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But that doesn't connect us like those two to you. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Unlike them..I don't act without reason. - Thu Nov 26 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I didn't cause those two to turn out the way they did. - Thu Nov 26 01:35:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And, at least one of them, was allowed in under your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We've already discussed this.  - Thu Nov 26 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The one - Ichirou, was it? Or Kida? - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The bodyguard of Shiro - the one you've already taken claim of for the actions of. You've said yourself you agree you'd be at fault if she took the life of others. - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You're taking agency for her actions. She is an object - you're an agent. - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The man as her bodyguard is the object of her - she is taking responsibility for whatever remaining agency he may have. This is because he went in under her name. And she went in under your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Following the chain - it falls back to you. You're the one with the ultimate agency of the entire web. - Thu Nov 26 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If a general were to bring his men - a lieutenant held a recruit under him and the lieutenant under the general. - Thu Nov 26 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If the recruit went crazy and murdered civilians would it not be the fault of the general who brought his men? - Thu Nov 26 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Much like a village or a kage is blamed for the actions of its shinobis. - Thu Nov 26 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The chain of command goes all the way up to you. - Thu Nov 26 01:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Wearing gloves to keep your hands clean of a crime doesn't wipe away any of the guilt. - Thu Nov 26 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I have no guilt, for I did nothing wrong. - Thu Nov 26 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This is for the kage and you to discuss. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: There's no need for me to prove my claims. The truth is just that. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'd gain nothing from lying. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Judging by the fact that the Mizukage didn't kill those two on the spot.. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And you hardly gained anything by lying and saying you were intending to kill me. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He didn't care for the man that was injured. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: For I have ties with you that go deeper.. - Thu Nov 26 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Than just a random person. - Thu Nov 26 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even if you don't believe it, Heiwa-kun. I watch over you. - Thu Nov 26 01:44:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe you'll potentially gain the power to order me around?~ - Thu Nov 26 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That'd be different. - Thu Nov 26 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you're dead before I can see that, then it'd be boring. - Thu Nov 26 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is a win-win for me helping you stay alive when I can. - Thu Nov 26 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even if you think I'm a creep. I do honor friendship. - Thu Nov 26 01:47:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is also why I am here.. - Thu Nov 26 01:48:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Thu Nov 26 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You talked to him and he said he'd like to talk to you? - Thu Nov 26 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yes, messages are quite slow. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is faster to get anything else across in person. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It isn't as if I am on the run.. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's not really the same as speaking to him. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We spoke as in he told me what happened to some extent. - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I told him that they weren't under my care, and that I had no idea as to the antics that they have been up to. - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I can't be responsible for every person that is injured in this world. - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Those under you you are responsible for. - Thu Nov 26 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: As I've said.. - Thu Nov 26 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The only one -under- me is "Shiro". - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Anyone that decides to associate themselves with her aren't under my watch, or her 's. - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Let's put it this way.. - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If I have to decide on saving Kida, Ichiro, or Shiro.. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You know who I'm going to pick. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The matter of agreement with her is the difference. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The man had an agreement to be her bodyguard. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's of similar clout to a shinobi swearing under a kage. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yes, and the agreement of the bodyguard is to protect the person. - Thu Nov 26 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: This doesn't fall under that. - Thu Nov 26 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I doubt this man was even a threat to Shiro if she was on the scene. - Thu Nov 26 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: His entrance would be guaranteed by Shiro's own entrance. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Meaning whatever he does that is not intended to protect her..isn't my, or her problem. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which, in itself, is guaranteed by your own. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The deal was made here. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He entered on his own. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I do wonder what I'd be sentenced.. - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you were the Mizukage, you'd most likely lock me up for several years. - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Like I said I'd talk to the kage myself just in case he's..feeling dumb. - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. I'd banish Kida and Ichirou. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Prevent their entry even with your passage. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They'd be unable to enter. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That doesn't bother me. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which is why I said I'd talk to the kage. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Psh..you're so nice to me. - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I feel as if you really do care for me! - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The main reason they're even being punished is because they tortured him. - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You still let Ortho go. - Thu Nov 26 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I let Ortho go..because I was more concerned about him not killing you. - Thu Nov 26 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sometimes you have to make choices. - Thu Nov 26 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Infact, you should be thanking me. - Thu Nov 26 02:12:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Are you going to be remaining in the village to wait for the Kage? - Thu Nov 26 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yep. - Thu Nov 26 02:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) stretches while walking towards the waterfall. She saw the two a bit further away and weaved a single seal. The girl utilized shunshin to cover the rest of the distance to the two."Hello." she said softly.* - Fri Nov 27 05:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah - what're we going for? - Fri Nov 27 06:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Deer, boars, everything. - Fri Nov 27 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mmmm. I could try to capture a deer. - Fri Nov 27 06:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright we both chain and I'll try to finish it off. - Fri Nov 27 06:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Just for now. You can help Yumiko finish it off. - Fri Nov 27 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) follows along also trying not to make much noise herself. She breaths in begining to slow down her breathing while moving. Her eyes keep looking for any animal near by.* - Fri Nov 27 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) look over in the direction he pointed in. She had kept the breathing rate constant while begining to move.Once she got closer she holds her breath completely while walking towards her new target. Her hands moved to her chest while she waited on Nori to make the first move against the animal she was hunting.* - Fri Nov 27 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) decided as well to assist in binding the animal. It might not have been needed but it was good practice at the very least. She weaved together the hand seals back to back until the final one was made for her. Then she paces her hand on the ground. 

More chains came from the ground aiming to bind the deer in place. She breaths out getting up and pulling out her bow without a string holding it to the deer and backing away once it was captured."Target practice begins now." she said out loud while maintaining the chakra.* - Fri Nov 27 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) flows her chakra rather slowly into the bow forming an arrow. Her eyes focus on her now still target. Taking aim she fired the arrow over to the deer they hunted. However, her aim was rather off.The arrow shot over the deer due to her aim not being good with it and the fact that she was at a distance from it.

In the mean time she went to adjust her aim and build up her chakra again. She was not rushing her shots rather taking her time to focus on improving her accuracy rather than try hit the target.* - Fri Nov 27 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: That's....awful. - Fri Nov 27 08:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) shot another arrow still maintaining her chakraflow and not undoing her set of chains on the deer. Even with her adjusted aim she missed yet again causing quite a bit of fustration this time. An audible sigh escapes her lips once she noticed she failed to hit it again.

Turning Kariudo she look and inclined her head to the side. She didn't speak to her outloud but she did politely wave at her as a way of greeting her. The bow was lowered in the mean time.* - Fri Nov 27 09:06:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) crosses her arms noticing he went from point A to B rather quickly. She was actually shocked at the speed of the shunshin rather than the him not being disoriented from the technique. She nodded her head once he utilized the second one listening to her explination.

"Well and to think I thought I was fast using it. You're pretty good." she said interlocking her hands and sending chakra through her body while doing so. Taking her time to exhale she also utilize the technique appearing behind him, however her skill in the jutsu was not as potent as Tengoku's.

"I've practiced this a lot but it seems you're a lot better than I am." she said sitting down and stretching her arms out after using the jutsu.* - Sat Nov 28 06:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm an elementalist, but I picked up shunshin as well. I can't attack while using it but it helps when a strong attack is heading your way.~ - Sat Nov 28 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's pretty cool. - Sat Nov 28 06:47:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) heard Nori clap her hands and decided to play a little prank of her own. She also went through a few hand seals. To be specific the same ones Nori did. However unlike Nori who targeted Tengoku, she targeted Nori herself! While she was distracted by him she decided to tie Nori up instead hopingto bind her while saying the samething.

"Surprise!" she shouted at Nori hoping to successfully catch her. If she was successful instead of letting her go she walked over to her and begin to comb her hair giggling a bit while keeping her tied up for a while.* - Sat Nov 28 07:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) took a few dumplings for herself and then noticed Nori going through the dumplings extremely fast. For a good twenty seconds she watched a bit shocked at how Nori was acting. Almost as if her brain was a computer and it took that long to realize how weird this was. After a few seconds she stood up, moved over to Nori and grabbed her to try and stop the girl.* - Sun Nov 29 08:17:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) walk out stretching looking towards Heiwa. Once they got to an area where she thought it was safe, Yumiko shook her head up and down."A ninjutsu spar does sound great. It would give me a chance to work on a few things. So no genjutsu." she states cracking her fingers.* - Sun Nov 29 11:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. It has. Heard any word of the Mizukage lately? - Mon Nov 30 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He's dead. - Mon Nov 30 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Wait. - Mon Nov 30 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lord Liu, or the new Mizukage? - Mon Nov 30 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...What do you mean he's dead? - Mon Nov 30 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What happened? - Mon Nov 30 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lord Lou died. - Mon Nov 30 03:20:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Do I have to ask again..? - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What happened? - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: We went on a mission to Konoha. - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He tried to harass a woman. - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ended up punching a defense mechanism type of thing. - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: And it broke into shard and pierced him all over his body. - Mon Nov 30 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Mon Nov 30 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What was the mission about? Why were there no guards brought with him? - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Because to be frank, he was being stupid. - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: No offense. - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Suicidal coot. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Who's this 'new mizukage'? - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Don't know. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Never seen 'em. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Are you sure the spot has been even filled? - Mon Nov 30 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Not too sure. - Mon Nov 30 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Just a rumor I heard. - Mon Nov 30 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: And the power vacuum starts again. There are only two candidates Liu would have in mind. - Mon Nov 30 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I cou - Mon Nov 30 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I wouldn't have been able to react fast enough to pull him out before the shars got him. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then again, it was only a jutsu used to defend the woman, not harm the Godaime. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He decided to punch through it, and then the crystals shattered. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: *sigh* - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Crystal? Was the one who used said technique - did they have purple hair? - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If I recall correctly, yes. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: I was just thinking the samething. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I think he was originally from this village as well. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hm? - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If it's that person he wasn't originally from Kirigakure. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He's from Konohagakure. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He did reside here at one point or another, correct? - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's odd. - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Liu offered him a transfer to the village on temporary probation. - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He lost a fight and was criticized for his fighting style. Reacting negatively he stormed off - he was thereafter exiled from the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I see... - Mon Nov 30 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: From the sounds of that he made a new technique, however. Finally took the advice I gave him to heart..in order to kill the Mizukage. - Mon Nov 30 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Though I must say. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It seems as if that man never meant to kill Lord Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Liu put himself in that situation. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: That's much easier to say than Lord Liu, or Lord Mizukage, or the Godaime. But that's disrespectful. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Regardless I should have killed him. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lord Liu, excuse me. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Why do you say that? - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Because if I did then it might not have happen and he might be alive today. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Right. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The thing is, Yumiko, it's not quite Abraxes's fault. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Besides - Liu was unfit for the job. - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori can attest to that. - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A few months prior he handed us his hat and mentioned he was going to 'walk off into the woods and die.' - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And then there is the matter of how he became Mizukage to begin with. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I still can't believe it though. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He tells me to scout Konohagakure, and get a "feel" for it. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A feel for it? - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Was he..intending to attack Konoha? - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then he transforms into me, and waltzes right into the villages, trying to feel a woman's knockers. - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah, like the type of people, the environment. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's presence, whatever you may call it. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He was -very- unfit. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: To think he made -me- his "bodyguard." - Mon Nov 30 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: I'm too weak for that type of stuff. - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I see. - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Regardless of how unfit he was, he at least prepared for the future.  - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I guess... - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fighting over who the Mizukage is won't be necessary. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There are two candidates. One of which is the captain of the general military of the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How come? - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: The other? - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: The other is the captain of the binding and genjutsu corps. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The other is the captain of the binding and the genjutsu corps. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Right. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The two highest ranks made by the Mizukage before his death. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How will either of them be chosen? - Mon Nov 30 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: More by whomever fully chooses the title than anything.  - Mon Nov 30 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: After that - well it depends on various other factors.  - Mon Nov 30 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I predict it will go to the military captain - Kana. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Kana, I've heard of her. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: The name sounds familiar. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She's a chunnin of the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A strong fighter too. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I imagine she is, at least. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: She might be able to teach me a trick or two. - Mon Nov 30 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: From Chuunin, to Captain of the General Military, to Mizukage? - Mon Nov 30 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's quite the jump. - Mon Nov 30 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not nearly as large of a jump as some kages in the past. - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Including Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Where did he start? - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fresh from the academy basically. - Mon Nov 30 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: What!? - Mon Nov 30 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Tha-That's crazy. - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Kirigakure has not been in strong straits for the last couple of months.. - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I doubt Liu made much of an announcement of my rank. Beyond Yumiko and Nori at least. - Mon Nov 30 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That, I know. - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's about time that we fix it, right? - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. The people in Kiri deserve better than what we've had. - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Agreed. - Mon Nov 30 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Tengoku, right? - Mon Nov 30 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You are correct. - Mon Nov 30 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Heiwa? - Mon Nov 30 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Wait, I'm probably wrong. - Mon Nov 30 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hewai? - Mon Nov 30 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That sounds right. - Mon Nov 30 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Heiwa. - Mon Nov 30 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You had it right the first time. - Mon Nov 30 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Oi, that's embarrassing.~ - Mon Nov 30 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Excuse me, Heiwa. - Mon Nov 30 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'm bad with names.~ - Mon Nov 30 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Nick names are best for that then. - Mon Nov 30 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right Tenny?~ - Mon Nov 30 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah--Yumi!~ - Mon Nov 30 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Oi.~ - Mon Nov 30 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Someone's woken up from a slumber. - Mon Nov 30 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Morning. . .Or night. . I forget..  - Mon Nov 30 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How was your sleep? - Mon Nov 30 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Good! Was tired. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Tenny? Yumi? - Mon Nov 30 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Awesome! - Mon Nov 30 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Up late researching again, Nori? - Mon Nov 30 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Researching? - Mon Nov 30 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. . Sure. . - Mon Nov 30 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Research. .  - Mon Nov 30 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: That's what I've been doing. - Mon Nov 30 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: ..? - Mon Nov 30 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori is a medic. - Mon Nov 30 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She's often up late studying plants and herbs. - Mon Nov 30 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Or chaining herself up.. - Mon Nov 30 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Or doing both.~ *omit* - Mon Nov 30 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's pretty cool. - Mon Nov 30 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I've got to admit, Nori, I thought you were training to be an expert in chained weapons. - Mon Nov 30 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Or rather, chains in general. - Mon Nov 30 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmmm .. I should try containment after medical works, to be honest. . - Mon Nov 30 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Containment?  - Mon Nov 30 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Fuuinjutsu. Sealing stuff. - Mon Nov 30 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Then after being full on white mage I could go and get some offense stuff. - Mon Nov 30 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hrm, I might detach from my scouting ways for a brief period. - Mon Nov 30 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Possibly learn some new things. - Mon Nov 30 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. You're a scout?  - Mon Nov 30 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: He's better at shunshin than me. - Mon Nov 30 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Really?  - Mon Nov 30 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How much better? - Mon Nov 30 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: He's faster than me and doesn't get disoriented. - Mon Nov 30 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I fell in the water once. - Mon Nov 30 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see - fell in the water? - Mon Nov 30 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 30 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What water? - Mon Nov 30 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Someone went a bit to far with their shunshin and an accident happen. - Mon Nov 30 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Ah - she's still having trouble with it? - Mon Nov 30 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I was .. tired at the time. - Mon Nov 30 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) shakes her head up and down moving and leaning against the wall yawning again. She stretches out and nods her head."So you accidently took a nice dip in the water to wake up.~"* - Mon Nov 30 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Anyway, yeah. I'm a scout. - Mon Nov 30 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's probably the only thing I'm good at. - Mon Nov 30 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How good are you at it? - Mon Nov 30 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Depends. - Mon Nov 30 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If we're speak relatively, then it depends. - Mon Nov 30 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: In general, I'm fairly adept in my profession. - Mon Nov 30 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Wouldn't say I'm the best there is, but I'm close. - Mon Nov 30 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Well what can you do? Few people work to become scouts. - Mon Nov 30 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: As these girls have mentioned, my best skill lies in the art of Shunshin. - Mon Nov 30 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I can get in, and get out quickly unnoticed. - Mon Nov 30 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Kinds sound of assassin-esque, excuse me. - Mon Nov 30 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Weak. - Mon Nov 30 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Effective. - Mon Nov 30 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Useful. - Mon Nov 30 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Could you show me? - Mon Nov 30 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Idiot. - Mon Nov 30 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov 30 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah, it's possible. - Mon Nov 30 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I mean, I think I'm fairly skilled at it. But that's primarily my only skill. - Mon Nov 30 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I can overwhelm someone, but I'm rather weak i. - Mon Nov 30 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'm rather weak in taijutsu. - Mon Nov 30 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm - Are you intending to work on Taijutsu? - Mon Nov 30 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Soon enough, yes. - Mon Nov 30 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: My Shunshin abilities wouldn't prove well in combat if I didn't work on taijutsu. - Mon Nov 30 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Either Taijutsu or Kenjutsu. If you need a sparring partner I'd be up for it - like I do the same with Nori and Yumiko. - Mon Nov 30 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm. - Mon Nov 30 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Seems everyone here but two are weak. - Mon Nov 30 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That would be nice. - Mon Nov 30 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Thanks Heiwa. - Mon Nov 30 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) yawns once more stretching."Using shunshin like that was pretty cool."* - Mon Nov 30 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Thanks, Yumi.~ - Mon Nov 30 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm - evening.  - Mon Nov 30 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Bored. - Mon Nov 30 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yumiko, are you busy? - Mon Nov 30 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm not busy at all. - Mon Nov 30 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alright, I'll be off. - Mon Nov 30 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: See you guys later. - Mon Nov 30 07:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I have something to show you - lets go to the waterfall. - Mon Nov 30 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 30 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) follows him shoving her hands in her pockets.* - Mon Nov 30 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) looked over to him before turning her head and looking down. She had to think about it for a moment. She didn't know that many suiton techniques at all. She look at the hand seal and did the same seal."What's the name of it?" she asked him.* - Mon Nov 30 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) payed attention to the other seal the tiger one and surged her chakra up to her mouth. While she listen to the explination she began to picture something sticky.Once she saw the technique being used she knew what it was for. The name said it all. 

While molding her chakra she picture adding a large amount of syrup to water. As if she was going to spit out the mizurappa technique with syrup instead. Then she picture her normal water rushing to it as well.She then releases it out at once.

The technique flows out to the ground.Her eyes shot open and she breaths out."What an odd technique." she said knowing how effective it could be.After all it turned a moving target to a still target after all.* - Mon Nov 30 08:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's very useful. We should have used it on that guy. - Mon Nov 30 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The old guy? - Mon Nov 30 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 30 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It wouldn't be too useful if we couldn't track him, though. Or if his barrier were able to deflect the technique. - Mon Nov 30 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It would turn it into a range fight however. - Mon Nov 30 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm - but first things first was deducing whether his barrier could deflect it to begin with. - Mon Nov 30 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If it could..it'd hardly do much. - Mon Nov 30 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: This is true. - Mon Nov 30 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) moves up next to him and shook her head up and down."The question is what comes next...."* - Mon Nov 30 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...A new kage is required. - Mon Nov 30 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's..clear. - Mon Nov 30 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You think Kana would accept it? - Mon Nov 30 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Would she be the right person for it? - Mon Nov 30 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Is there another person for it? The lone adult with any strength in a village of children.. - Mon Nov 30 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: ....True. - Mon Nov 30 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: But she seems weird. - Mon Nov 30 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm? - Mon Nov 30 10:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Like uh. - Mon Nov 30 10:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Me no no how to say it. - Mon Nov 30 10:05:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) sat down thinking with her bow by her side. She sighed out loud wondering how to kill two birds with one stone. She shakes her head left and right breathing out for the moment. She then stood up once an idea hit her head. Stretching her body she kept the bow on the ground before lifting her hands up shuffling through a series of hand seals.

"Kuchiyose, Iron Maiden." she said causing the statue to rise from the ground which was split down the middle. The statue then closes with chains wrapping around it. However, the statue did not start sinking yet. Instead it stood there while Yumiko continued to maintain her chakra flow.

The girl picks the bow up and takes aim at her now huge ass target. Flowing chakra to her bow she fired her arrow to the statue aiming to hit the side of the cat's arm. However, sadly her arrow went off course and nicked it. 

Not one to give up yet she flowed her chakra to her bow once more aiming for the same target. This time she hit her mark but it wasn't skill just yet. Just luck, pure luck this time. She nodded her head deciding that was enough for now and sits her bow back down.

Once she did so the statue goes back down to the ground. The young girl turned around walking off letting out a yawn when doing so. "Guess I'll go say hi to everyone. But before that I guess I'll grab a bite to eat." she said softly to herself.* - Tue Dec  1 01:10:24 2015
