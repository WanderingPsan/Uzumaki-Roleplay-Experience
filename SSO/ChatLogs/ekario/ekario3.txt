<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) closes her eyes and begins building up chakra. She was trying not to waste as much chakra as she usually did when building it up. Breathing out slowly she forms the ram seal to assist in molding her chakra. Surging it around her body to temporary increase her movement speed the girl breaths out in a gentle manner.

She opens her eyes to see where she was going. A cloud of smoke appeared round her going from one place to another in order to hide her movements. It was still to slow and the side effects were kicking in. She leans up against the wall of the near by building waiting for them to pass.

Bringing her feet up to her chest she tilts her head up exhaling rubbing her ees once the side effects were over."Got to get use to this." she said to herself softly breathing rather hard still using to much chakra over all not happy about it.* - Wed Nov 18 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: M-mhm....shunshin takes a lot out of me. I'm still not use to the effects of it. How are you? - Wed Nov 18 13:02:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm...a lady delivered the message after that weird guy spoke to her. - Wed Nov 18 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It doesn't seem like we have much of a choice on entering.. - Wed Nov 18 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I figured... - Wed Nov 18 13:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Do you think we can handle it? - Wed Nov 18 13:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: When I think of the exams I think of people who are as strong as the lighting lady. - Wed Nov 18 13:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The lighting lady? - Wed Nov 18 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: The one who injured my arm... - Wed Nov 18 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Isn't there a written test normally before anything else? - Wed Nov 18 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We could just bomb that. - Wed Nov 18 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You want to? - Wed Nov 18 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah. I don't want you or Nori to get hurt.. - Wed Nov 18 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright then. - Wed Nov 18 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) stands up stretching once more."Going to try this again. Feel a bit better and trying to use less chakra when using the jutsu along with getting use to the jutsu over all so I don't have to stop after each use." she states now building up chakra again. Exhaling out she flows a bit less chakra trying to cut back each time more and more.

The girl forms a seal quickly and took off shunshining next to Heiwa. A shorter distance than before but she did notice that she wasn't as dizzy as before. Once she got there the girl stood in place. The effects were still taxing on her reserves but the effects on her body were not as bad as before. Even her reserves it wasn't as bad as before.

However Yumiko was still feeling the effects even if they were not as bad as previously. She had to sit down after standing for a few seconds. She breaths out slowly trying to regulate it."Ahh...." she said pretty much the sky spinning at the moment for her.* - Wed Nov 18 13:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: That's true....however, it did keep me alive luckly. - Wed Nov 18 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Yeah. I shouldn't have left you like that..by the way.  - Wed Nov 18 14:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I didn't think any jutsu..could move that fast. - Wed Nov 18 14:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Wish we could have forced some information out of her. - Wed Nov 18 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm..she was dead before I was given a chance. - Wed Nov 18 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmm maybe next time under conditions we can find a way to get information without them knowing. - Wed Nov 18 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Without them knowing? - Wed Nov 18 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm.  - Wed Nov 18 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Heiwa-kun go stand a little bit away from the tree. Going to try and shunshin to you. - Wed Nov 18 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) picks herself up off the ground and dust herself off. Just incase something went wrong when the chuunin exams came she decided to be ready. She stretches while Heiwa went towards the tree in order to get ready for the technique. A good way to practice control over all.

She lifts her hands up forming the hand seal and using it to help build up her chakra over all. Taking her time with it for the moment since she was not in the heat of battle to really mold her chakra and controll it the best she could Yumiko looks towards Heiwa. Once she was ready Yumiko made the signature cloud of smoke appear around her.

She took off using the jutsu while the cloud of smoke was there. Going to Heiwa she stop short almost falling. She could have gone further thanks to her constant practice with the jutsu helping her body over all speed. It was a physical work out, but she didn't feel like accidently running into the tree.

And then it happen. Side effects kicked in and she sat down."Still a problem....nothing was done in a day I suppose." the girl said breathing in and out roughly still from the usage of the technique. * - Wed Nov 18 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: That's true. - Wed Nov 18 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Once I'm rested up I'm trying again. - Wed Nov 18 14:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right.  - Wed Nov 18 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) look over towards him and saw him shoot out water from his mouth. Indeed it was a way to generate water for mist if need be. Along with something that could hurt if it hit someone. She remain neutral for a while until sighing"That's pretty good." she commented on the technique in general.

Having a good idea she decided to try and get use to her own technique first so it could be used in a fight without having to stop and rest so often. She gets up once more to build up her chakra and chuckle a bit. She lifts her hands forming the seal needed for the technique while he was unleashing the water.

Afterwards she channeled her chakra throughout her body getting ready to move. Once she was ready the girl took off leaving a cloud of smoke almost as if she was racing his technique. This wasn't her idea at all but just something to pass the time with. Once she stop she stood no longer needing to sit down. it seemed her body was getting even more use to the technique than before.

However she still did feel the side effects from the jutsu. She breaths out gently nodding her head up and down still winded, still dizzy but standing after the use of the jutsu showing some improvement. She also didn't use as much chakra as the girl use to need for the technique ether. Something she was happy about as well.* - Wed Nov 18 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) interlocks her hands into a single hand seal. It was time to up the difficulity in using the technique. Aside for practicing control she decided to add movement into her routine by zig zagging around using the technique. She figured that this would help her adjust to the jutsu faster.

She builds up her chakra rushing it this time acting like she was fighting the lady who had utilize raiton on her. She remembered how fast the raiton technique traveled and figured she had to move faster than that. A cloud of smoke appeared around of her as she finally utilize the technique after building up some chakra and she took off forward.

Mid run she moved to the side slightly and needless to say it was difficult to really turn during this. She tried correcting her path once more and almost tripped up with the movements before moving to the otherside. Diagonal aggressive movements were what she was going for.

Begining to tire out she continued moving side to side as fast as she could. Once she got to her destination she stood there noticing how difficult it was to pull off."Hmm." she thought to herself while the side effects were kicking in but still not as bad as before. At least she wasn't collapsing like usual.

Once they wore off she turned around and weaved together the hand seal again. Taking off she tried the samething moving side to side again while utilizing the jutsu until she ended up tripping and crashing into the dirt. She picks herself up feeling the effects of the technique still and dust her clothes off.

Once her clothes were dusted off Yumiko sits down and crosses her legs. She sighs out loud and thought about what she had done. Still dizzy and disoriented from the use she decided to keep still and relax for now breathing in and out slowly until the effects pass.* - Wed Nov 18 18:08:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Maybe this technique will help you out incase we have another mission like the last one. It's called shunshin. - Wed Nov 18 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. What does it do? - Wed Nov 18 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Well first things first it takes a decent amount chakra but it makes you move really fast from one place to another. - Wed Nov 18 20:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) places her hand on the table and picks herself up. She form the hand seal and a cloud of smoke appeared around her. She then moved from at the table to sitting in the chair stretched out relaxing."Well nothing really. You might feel a bit winded and I wouldn't try attacking with this technique yet. So try it around the house....without breaking anything."* - Wed Nov 18 20:32:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mind showing me? - Thu Nov 19 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Dutr. - Thu Nov 19 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) stood up on her feet and form the hand seal used for the technique. She opensher mouth and speaks slowly while channeling her chakra through her body."The first things you have to do is create something to cover your movements. This helps confuse an enemy as I've been told. Smoke is commonly used but I've heard of other techniques with elements involved in the past." she said with her chakra flowing slowly.

She continues speaking with her way of using the technique."Most of your chakra should go to the soles of your feet and you move. It's a quick burst of movement which goes from one place to another. After that it's just controlling your chakra and getting your body use to the effects." Once she finish speaking she utilize the technique to appear on the other side of her hoping Heiwa could learn off her explination.* - Thu Nov 19 06:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) moved over to help Heiwa up since she knew what it felt like to use that jutsu. It was a real bitch at times and because od that she sits down and allows him to lean on him after helping him up."It's that bad I know." she said sighing.* - Thu Nov 19 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It took me a long time...a real long time. - Thu Nov 19 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: My..head is still spinning. Can you take me back to the ground? I need..to sit this out. - Thu Nov 19 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Thu Nov 19 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) stands up and begins making her way down while holding onto him.* - Thu Nov 19 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Better? - Thu Nov 19 08:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Yeah. I'm getting there. - Thu Nov 19 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's..terrible as a feeling. - Thu Nov 19 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I know... - Thu Nov 19 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: You can rest on me. - Thu Nov 19 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm..Alright. - Thu Nov 19 08:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How long have you been working on that? - Thu Nov 19 08:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) open the door quietly and walked in only to see the iron chains popping out of the ground. She then follows them with her eyes being reminded of that mission. Where the chains had the people bound."Good evening." she said now letting herself be known if Heiwa didn't hear her walk through the door.* - Thu Nov 19 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm doing alright and you? - Thu Nov 19 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm alright. Feeling better. You seen Nori around? - Thu Nov 19 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not lately no. - Thu Nov 19 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I haven't for a while..Still never was able to discuss the plans about chunnins. - Thu Nov 19 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Speaking of which - mind if I show you something? - Thu Nov 19 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Alright. - Thu Nov 19 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) lets her following him.* - Thu Nov 19 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) took a few steps until she was next to him. Once she was she look to his hands watching him weave the seals. She observes each seal he made and listen to the names even if she knew what seals he was using. Once she knew she was going to have to replicate it Yumiko nodded her head.

She then listen to the explination to the technique he used. Needless to say it was a lot different than the other jutsu she knew how to utilize but that was to be suspected. This was more so about creating water for an offensive technique which would be useful in long run.

She decided to replicate it the best she could. She weaved together the hand seals required as fast as she could before lifting them up to her lips parting them. She molded her chakra and shot it up to her mouth."Suiton Mizurappa no jutsu." she thought to herself trying to send water out like Heiwa did only to send out what look like water coming out of a faucet on low. Drip drip drip.

With the obvious failure of the first attempt she decided to focus on a stream of water rather than the complete jutsu. She formed less water than before picturing a bird bath and tilted her head down. Sadly for her like he said to little water will result in coughing fits which just came. She started coughing quite a bit having to cough out all the water that did not come out of her.

Once she finish coughing her ass off the girl breaths her breath of fresh air. She focused on spreading the chakra in her body taking her advice after making the hand seals again. She didn't want to have yet another repeat of the previous failure. Breathing out once more the girl stood there molding her chakra until she felt ready.

Yumiko parted her lips and expanded her cheeks. Her index and thumb reach her lips and then she let the water come out slowly. The force wasn't as great as a master in it but it was better than before.* - Fri Nov 20 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) tilts her head down towards the flowers now having an idea. Best way to practice was to use it for natural things. She weaved together her hands repeating the processs she had just used. She still had chakra to burn after all. Maintaining her flow the girl spoke softly."Suiton Mizurappa no jutsu." she said.

She decided to let the water that came out of her mouth at a steady rate and use it to water the plants. Once she was finish the girl begins walking around keeping her chakra flow going for a while in order to continue to water them. She walk slowly around the house even watering the grass.

Once she got to the back of the house she took a stop for a breather. She regulates her breathing in and out before continuing her trip after making the seals again. She took her time while walking until she got back to her starting point where she sat down and relax.* - Fri Nov 20 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mmm. - Fri Nov 20 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: What'd I miss? - Fri Nov 20 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) waved to Nori and quickly ran inside to get a scrub brush. She couldn't reach that high with it because she was still a bit of a midget, but it had to do for now. She formed a few hand seals before looking up this time. Her ability iwth the ninjutsu still being quite decent even if she was still new at it.

"Suiton Mizurappa no jutsu." she thought to herself before spraying the house making sure not to damage it. She sprays it with water coming out of her mouth as much as possible keeping the chakra flowing the entire time. She moves inching around the front and pass Nori not spraying her at all. 

Once she had saturated the house Yumiko sprays the scrub brush on a handel. to wet it. Applying soap she starts to scrub the house down the best she could cleaning it. She hums while using this time to relax and take a break and rebuild chakra. She made the front of the house decently clean.

She places the scrub brush down and weaved together the hand seals required once more. Blowing out water she washes the soap off the scrub brush before doing the same to the house deciding to let it dry on it's own.* - Fri Nov 20 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: She's as motivated as I am it seems. - Fri Nov 20 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Hey, Nori, what're you up to? - Fri Nov 20 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) also went to help the girl up. She giggled a bit knowing her pain full well as she had trip a few times herself. Then the thought came to her head."How long until they come?" she asked looking to Heiwa wanting to see if he wanted to go with her idea or not.* - Fri Nov 20 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov 20 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Chuunins. - Fri Nov 20 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Eh? I'm not following. - Fri Nov 20 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Oh, uh. . - Fri Nov 20 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I kinda forgot not to do it in the house. .And I was talking about the chuunins after that. - Fri Nov 20 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: -- They're in a few days. - Fri Nov 20 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Heiwa are we still going to do what we spoke of or no? - Fri Nov 20 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Have you mentioned it to Nori? - Fri Nov 20 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Whisper it to her. - Fri Nov 20 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Huh? What? - Fri Nov 20 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: We were intending to fail the first part - the written exam. So we wouldn't have to be forced into the rest of the exam. - Fri Nov 20 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Alright..then we're together. - Fri Nov 20 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Really? - Fri Nov 20 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: As a squad, you mean? - Fri Nov 20 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Well..I figured we were already sort of a squad. I don't know if the chunnins would have one, but we're sticking together despite that. - Fri Nov 20 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Even if we don't have a squad together we're going to ..'do it' together. - Fri Nov 20 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov 20 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I was. . honestly. . planning to fail it though. . I know I wouldn't last long. - Fri Nov 20 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm..now none of us have to worry about getting hurt. Alright? - Fri Nov 20 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. . - Fri Nov 20 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Deal. - Fri Nov 20 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) look out the corner of her eye and yawned."Good evening." she said facing him.* - Fri Nov 20 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I'm doing alright. - Fri Nov 20 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: That's good. How's your training going? - Fri Nov 20 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's going pretty good. Would you like to see the results so far? - Fri Nov 20 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I would. How about y'come at me with all your might. Nori here'll patch me up after ya beat me. Hahah. - Fri Nov 20 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) inclined her head to the side and then nodded. She doubt Nori would end up needing to heal Mengde but all the sameshe decided to go for it. She simply started walk towards him before forming a hand seal and pulling out a kunai knife.

She wasn't a flicker fighter by nature. Something she eventually thought about doing but for now she figured a direct assault was good enough. She took off recklessly towards Mengde  with the kunai pointing forward hoping the stabbing motion. Since it was a simple forward strike she hope to sink it into his leg although she expected him to avoid it some how.* - Fri Nov 20 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) was not avoiding that one. She was horrible at close range fighting which might have been showed if she wanted to fight long range was the better option. After being bitch smack by the gunbai she drops the kunai to the ground and lets her body get use to the pain trying to get up and seemly be unable to do so thanks to the numbbing sensation. 

Shaking her head left and right she thought about what to do while scooting to the side.* - Fri Nov 20 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Be careful around that fan.. - Fri Nov 20 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) got up once the numbness wore off. She stretches out again recovering from the last attack. This time she pulled out three kunai with tags throwing them in different places. One at his knee, one at his shoulder and one at his dominate hand.

Once she threw the kunai with tags she runs forward this time while weaving together hand seals thinking more so than before now. She breaths out not wanting to get near that fan again however.* - Fri Nov 20 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) decided to challenge his jutsu wondering if she could over take it. She never did intend to use the kunai and tags and considering she had started making the hand seals before hand she wonder if she could perhaps surprise him. First things first she had to catch him off guard some how.

She jump a bit bringing her hand to her mouth her index and thumb being close to it."Suiton Mizurappa no jutsu." she thought first using long range against  Mengde. She wasn't holding back and hope that the attack was enough to push her higher up in the air. She was better at ninjutsu than close range combat. A lot better at it actually.

(10.6 control 14.12 nin. Not sure your stats)* - Fri Nov 20 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) haults her chakra flow and shifted her hand seals. She had what she needed to answer Mengde's question now. The best way in her opinion to face someone who can cover themselves from mutiple distances is to rob them of their sight. With the seal of confrontation made the water she created begins to spin around with the rest coming out of her mouth forming a mist around the area hoping to reduce visibility.* - Fri Nov 20 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) inclined her head to the side keeping the mist up. That was going to be a pain alone let alone trying to use other jutsu while maintaining the mist. She pulled out a kunai with a tag. She tried moving back not wanting to get close or stay still.  Once Menge's clone landed she threw the kunai towards where she thought the clone's face was hoping to hit the eye. Why the eye? Because child strength against adult body generally does not end well for a child, but for an eye shot that was completely different. If she had failed she was sweep off her feet from the first attack.* - Fri Nov 20 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) 's mist cleared upon the strike to the head. She was out cold without having much time to feel thestrike to the throat. Not to say it didn't hurt like hell when she did get hit. Once she was hit the girl fell over on the ground forward. The last thing that went through her mind was "When did he get there." before going night night.* - Fri Nov 20 05:29:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) didn't have much wounds. Just a few scrapes and bruses since Mengde didn't hit her as hard as he could of.* - Fri Nov 20 06:14:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Yeah. Killing a rogue shinobi from the Hidden Mist. - Fri Nov 20 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A rogue? Who? - Fri Nov 20 06:30:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: What type of ninjutsu does he use? - Fri Nov 20 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: If any at all. - Fri Nov 20 07:02:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: The last two people he killed were incinerated. - Fri Nov 20 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: BUT, they were also full of water... - Fri Nov 20 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Go on now. Get ready. - Fri Nov 20 07:03:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) walks off to get ready.* - Fri Nov 20 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Oh right. I have a lot of weapons. .  - Fri Nov 20 07:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) took the chance to attack in order to see the old man's speed and reaction time. Since she wasn't a target Yumiko drifted off to the north west while reaching into her holster. She then pulls out shuriken and launches it to him. She did prepare to collaborate with Heiwa if the chance presented itself.* - Fri Nov 20 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) took the chance to take off again and strike. Staying behind the trees she decided to launch another attack. This time it wasn't shuriken but instead she threw poison bombs near the area. Not directly at him however.

After she threw the poison bombs she weaved together a hand seal and built up chakra again. What was she doing now?* - Fri Nov 20 08:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) had formed a hand seal for a reason. While she was in the line of fire the girl suddenly utilize shunshin while being on the move deciding to remain near the trees. Dissappearing in a cloud of smoke herself she moved at high speed aiming to avoid the arrow and get down lower to the ground incase she was still in the line of fire. The trees being used as protection or at least trying to.

She knew the fire arrows could rip the trees a new asshole. That was demonstrated when the Maneki Neko was shot through and still hit the tree. The girl covered her head temporary not feeling any effects from shunshin at all yet hoping Heiwa's attack was enough to bind Betty.* - Fri Nov 20 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) wanted to make sure he was dead. One could always fake their death right? Well if he wasn't dead she threw a kunai aimed at Betty's head with an explosive tag strapped around it. If it hit the out come would be obvious. Head goes boom.* - Fri Nov 20 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) moved towards the tree Betty shot at first. She lifted her hands up and built up chakra in the core of her stomach. She breaths in and converts her chakra into water sending it up to her cheeks making them expand."Suiton Mizurappa no jutsu." she thought to herself unleashing water towards the tree.

It probably take a while to put out the fire there but the good thing about it is if she was successful she could become smokey the bear's best friend from preventing a wild fire. Well probably not considering it rains a lot in Amegakure but who knows. In any case she took note of the name he said before head goes boom.* - Fri Nov 20 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Betty(They.Call.Me.Wynn) whispers: ( did you loot him yet? I'd do that quick before Kana steals the loot ) - Fri Nov 20 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) moves over towards Betty humming to collect anything worth while from the corpse.* - Fri Nov 20 09:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) slashes a piece of his clothing digging deep enough t get some of the corpse's blood on it as proof of killing Betty. No need to bring the entire body back. Once she was done she begins heading back to Kirigakure."I did, they will benifit Nori." she said after taking the two scrolls.* - Fri Nov 20 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Good job killing that individual. - Fri Nov 20 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You did the Bla- You did well for the world as a whole. - Fri Nov 20 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: There's a problem. - Fri Nov 20 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Hm? - Fri Nov 20 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Our target knew Leera. - Fri Nov 20 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yeah. That bandit from earlier - the one attacking Genjigakure. - Fri Nov 20 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Yeah. I know.  - Fri Nov 20 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: They -were- siblings. The Old man and the Young Assassin. Chain and Strike...Their combination was terrifying. - Fri Nov 20 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Are there any more siblings? - Fri Nov 20 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Siblings? With that age gap? - Fri Nov 20 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: No no, they were the only siblings amongst u- Amongst their...Group. - Fri Nov 20 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: So there are more of them. - Fri Nov 20 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Hmm...Leera, Lerixus, Betty...Just four more.. - Fri Nov 20 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) thinks: Including myself but I was smart enough to get into politics...Idiots. - Fri Nov 20 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Why did their group rogue from the village? - Fri Nov 20 09:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Lots of reasons...Lack of backing..Lots of...In fighting..There was a power vacuum things fell apart. - Fri Nov 20 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: W-They scattered to the four winds...Some teamed up. Others went solo. - Fri Nov 20 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Makes sense..I'm sure more than just them left due to the power vacuum. Technically even we did for a short time. - Fri Nov 20 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Most just..Tried to fade away. But a few.Like thel last two you fought..Just lost their minds. - Fri Nov 20 09:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see. So none of the other four have shown themselves against the village? - Fri Nov 20 09:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: ...Not against. One of them sent me a letter asking for amnesty...I told him to be here in a few days...New Mission. - Fri Nov 20 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Kana, Heiwa, Yumiko, Nori...When the visitor known as Xerif of the Mist reaches the village. It's your job to eliminate him. - Fri Nov 20 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Ranking of the mission? - Fri Nov 20 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: --His amnesty is being denied? - Fri Nov 20 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: S. By all rights I can't give you an S-rank mission...But that's how serious it is....It will count as Three C-Ranks... - Fri Nov 20 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He is a very high ranked user of Kirigakure no Jutsu.... - Fri Nov 20 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: ........ - Fri Nov 20 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: That's going to be a huge problem. - Fri Nov 20 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..An S rank... - Fri Nov 20 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: That's why you strike before he does. - Fri Nov 20 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: I was thinking about that. - Fri Nov 20 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: That is what the training I gave you earlier was for... - Fri Nov 20 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: It was a hint... - Fri Nov 20 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You utilized the technique, but you can't even fight in it... - Fri Nov 20 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: But for now...Good job. Time for rest. - Fri Nov 20 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) closes her eyes for a moment before lifting her hands up turning towards the tree. She shuffles through the hand seals required for the technique while focusing on her chakra converting it to water. Her cheeks expand with the water rushing to her mouth."Suiton Mizurappa no jutsu." the girl thought to herself.

The water was released towards the tree hitting the target dead on. Yumiko decided to maintain her chakra the entire time keeping the stream up. The girl begins haulting her flow not bringing it to a complete stop. The goal was to use less chakra than before for the technique without stopping it. She was trying to stop wasting so much chakra in the first place.

The grass around the area began to get wet and the spot on the tree became moist. She was like a hose spraying the grass but then again that's what she wanted. The volume of water began to decrease however. This was not due to her chakra running out but rather her needing to stop for a breather.

Once she stops the girl sits on the ground and exhales closing her eyes."Still should practice breathing control so I can maintain that longer." she muttered lowly to herself regulating her breathing.* - Fri Nov 20 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) tilts her head up while making the seals again and bringing her index and middle thumb to her lips. She aims slightly above the spot she saturated with the suiton technique once deciding to saturate the section of a tree. Since she wasn't skilled with a bow personally she decided to practice by making a target for herself. 

Knowing that hitting a small target was going to be hard for her she decided to try for bigger targets for now. Then again she did not want the tree itself to be the target. A bit of a challenge was nice. Maintaining her flow she now moves her head while spraying the tree with the water coming out of her mouth.

Once again needless to say she needed a break temporary. She haults her flow of chakra and takes a seat to regulate her breathing."That should be enough." she said out loud letting a sigh out afterwards while taking her minor break.* - Fri Nov 20 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) reaches down and takes the bow. She flows chakra into it and needless to say the first shot she made wasn't to impressive. Infact she fell short of hitting the target. This made her grunt a bit.Only reason she was trying hard was because of the next mission coming up.

She shook her head expecting such however. That was her first shot with the bow. She adjusted her aim trying to aim higher, however, this time she aim to high. The chakra enhanced arrow went into the tree above her target which was not desireable. She could barely use the thing in combat for now."I can't rely on my mist so the only thing I have to fall back on is my attack suiton and my bow. Even the azin maiden cost to much chakra for me right now." she thought to herself.

It was obvious she was taking Mengde words to heart about using the mist technique without being able to really use it. With that in mind she loaded up another arrow and shot it again once again aiming to high and making it stick in the tree. Rather deep but we get the idea.* - Fri Nov 20 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) lowers her bow slightly building up chakra again. She flows it into the bow and fires it going below the target. Yes it was actually possible with the way she soaked the tree. The girl shook her head left and right sighing again in dissapointment. She wasn't going to be the best marksmen over night but at least being able to aim properly would help.

With more chakra added to the bow she shot another arrow. This one actually hit the target barely but a confrimed hit. It restored her confidence a little causing her to smile. She tried hitting the same target again but miss that time. Wasting quite a bit of chakra as a result.

Yumiko sits the bow down as well as herself. She closes her eyes deciding for quite a long break this time. A time to clear her head and approch the situation with a clear mind. She figured that was the way to go about this.* - Fri Nov 20 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) lifted her hands up after her rest time and look up at the sky. She breaths in making the hand seals and begins walking. Putting her index finger and thumb close to her mouth she spoke."Suiton Mizurappa no jutsu." she whispers letting the water come out.

The water came back down like if she was a walking sprinkler. She continued going around using her suiton to water  the grass and plants around the house. An odd way to practice but effective when it comes to applying shinobi skills to situations most people wouldn't take advantage of.* - Fri Nov 20 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hey. - Fri Nov 20 14:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Hey. - Fri Nov 20 14:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: How are you? - Fri Nov 20 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I'm fine. Nori wake up yet? - Fri Nov 20 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Not yet no. - Fri Nov 20 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Mizurappa I've finally gotten it down. - Fri Nov 20 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Have you? That's good..I guess we've both been busy over the last few days. - Fri Nov 20 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Ekario) lifts her hands up weaving together the hand seals needed for the current jutsu. Looking out to the ocean she finish the final one."Kuchiyose Iron Maiden." she whispered making the cat rise up from the ground splitting it open. It then closes before being wrapped in chains and sinking back into the ground.

Yumiko was standing there thinking before sitting back down. She was thinking about how much chakra that used and figured it was only to be used as a last resort for now. Of course she planned to work on her control to make the jutsu less chakra taxing for her in general.

After just once use she was a bit fatigued. Clearly the jutsu took a lot out of her. Breathing out a bit she decided not to try anything else for now. She didn't know when the guy would be here and had to be ready for the mission given to her.* - Fri Nov 20 17:59:28 2015
