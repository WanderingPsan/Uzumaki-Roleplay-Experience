<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Noriko(GraciousCallalily) settled down in an isolated location, this being her private mansion, she wanted to assure no one would disturb her work. Settting all her caligraphy gear out and massive sheets of cloth she began to paint numerous explosive tags on the seals. It was so many that the amount was nearly unable to be calculated by merely natural method of counting. 

After all of the massive amounts of seals were written she began to create a massive ten gallon pot of glue modge podge type icky stuff that would be the bonding agent to seal the tags together into basketball sized bombs. She took the time to create each one, this would take a very long time, nearly half a day in fact as she had been working for so long with no food or water. This was a very important task she needed to complete. Once all seventy five of the basketball sized bombs had been created they just needed to be activated one at a time and sealed inside a normal looking messenger scroll from Konoha. She took an old konoha scroll and drew the seal inside and then activated one bomb at a time before sealing it into the scroll extremely carefully.

The concentration and focus required was causing sweat to form on her brow and then the rest of her body as the hours passed of trying to activate each bomb and seal it away without killing herself. Her expertise is the only thing she had on her side while doing this and eventually she had finished with severe chakra depletion. Directly afterwards she sealed the scroll into her sleeve and went to rest to regain her chakra through meditation and sleep, soon after getting food to replenish her physical body.* - Tue Sep 01 00:08:19 2015
