<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You not going to tell me how you fight? - Wed Dec  2 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well, I fight similar to Ichiro and Shiro. More like Shiro in the sense that I use my legs more often. - Wed Dec  2 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: But just using my legs isn't going to keep me strong. - Wed Dec  2 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh...wow so much taijutsu. - Wed Dec  2 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I mean... - Wed Dec  2 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I do know a little ninjutsu, but I don't really focus on it. - Wed Dec  2 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I kind of...don't have anything to teach you, I can't teach you my families abilities. - Wed Dec  2 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I mean, there's some things I can probably mix with my taijutsu. - Wed Dec  2 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) bopped him upside the head, "You said you use kicks mostly."* - Wed Dec  2 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Tell me what you use then. - Wed Dec  2 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: What else do you want me to say? I use mostly taijutsu, and I know one or two ninjutsu. - Wed Dec  2 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...Then you use that, why did you act like you use something el-- - Wed Dec  2 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) blinked a bit at him calling her and Kida love birds and it caused her nose to wrinkle up in response. She stuffed her hands into her hoodie pocket but for now she had on a giant cloak that was hiding most of her body other than her face and end of boots, she also looked slightly more tan than the last time he saw her. * - Wed Dec  2 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: ...right.. - Wed Dec  2 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: I wonder what Ichiro thinks...hearing Kida basically say his own sister having a BF is laughable....Hmm - Wed Dec  2 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) huffed at the laughing from Kida, that was rude as hell. She glared at Kida for a bit before lowering her gaze to her body and shrugging. "It's generic clothing you can get anywhere, I try not to stick out...." She reached up and undid the two buttons at the top before pulling the cloak off and letting it rest on the ground to reveal her multiple arms and the custom made hoodie to fit all of her arms with sleeves. "It's necessary at times...."* - Wed Dec  2 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Nothing. Just doing stuff. - Wed Dec  2 05:44:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: I wonder if I can get Sanoke to send one over here.  Heh. Shiro in a maid outfit. - Wed Dec  2 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Eh, some guy in rice village. - Wed Dec  2 05:48:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .... yes I shoot webs. - Wed Dec  2 06:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well, let's see.. - Wed Dec  2 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) waited for him to decide, he was very indecisive.* - Wed Dec  2 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I don't want to hurt you, so how about I teach you something? - Wed Dec  2 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It's a useful skill to have. - Wed Dec  2 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Have you ever heard of shunshin? - Wed Dec  2 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .... hurt me? - Wed Dec  2 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You......hah.. - Wed Dec  2 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) began to laugh out rather boldly.* - Wed Dec  2 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: ... - Wed Dec  2 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I guess you don't want to learn this cool move. - Wed Dec  2 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Okay okay... go ahead. - Wed Dec  2 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, as I was saying, do you know about the technique? - Wed Dec  2 07:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Nah. - Wed Dec  2 07:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) blew a bubble.* - Wed Dec  2 07:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Then I'll show you something. - Wed Dec  2 07:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) watched him show her the single ram seal and that was easy as fuck. She saw him dissappear and then appear in another location. "How...did you do that?" she didn't understand the mechanics of it and couldn't be expected to control her chakra correctly without knowing how. She flowed her chakra out and formed a single seal quickly but she wasn't sure how to make herself be somewhere else. She 'willed' herself forward ten feet but nothing happened.* - Wed Dec  2 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ninjutsu, that's how. - Wed Dec  2 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It's a technique called shunshin. - Wed Dec  2 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ..................... - Wed Dec  2 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: It's basically teleportation, but it's not. - Wed Dec  2 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You are a fucking idiot sometimes. - Wed Dec  2 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...--thank you. - Wed Dec  2 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Jesus. - Wed Dec  2 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: 'Ninjutsu' isn't explaining shit. - Wed Dec  2 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: You're losing your cuteness. - Wed Dec  2 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: -- - Wed Dec  2 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) 's nostils flared and she glanced away.* - Wed Dec  2 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright, back to the lesson. - Wed Dec  2 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So, it's a technique that seems like teleportation, but it's actually high speed movement. - Wed Dec  2 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: When it was taught to me, I was told in this way. 'Imagine getting a jumpstart of energy, and using that energy you move to a location that you visualize.' - Wed Dec  2 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Trust me, I had trouble learning this. I ran into a tree, bushes, a wall. A lot of stuff. - Wed Dec  2 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why didn't you say that at first then and get all pissed when I asked for it. - Wed Dec  2 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: The technique uses the ram seal. Try it out. I'm sure you can learn it. - Wed Dec  2 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) had very good chakra control, when he spoke all of this she now understood how it worked and then folded her hands into the seals and shot forward a few feet. She stumbled a bit and caught herself with her lowest most arm on the left side and pushed herself back up. She felt extremely dizzy and even a little sick to her stomach. She grumbled some and shook her head while reaching up wiht her upper most right arm and rubbing the side of her head through the hood's material. * - Wed Dec  2 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Oh right. I almost forgot. You're going to feel the inertia. - Wed Dec  2 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: You'll get used to it eventually. - Wed Dec  2 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Erg... - Wed Dec  2 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) shot a look at him but she looked out of it and then turned back around an faced the open road before her. Forming the single seal again rather swiftly she shot forward a bit further this time and slightly faster---but this time she couldn't stop fast enough and ended up tumbling forward a few feet across the path and then grass.* - Wed Dec  2 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) laid on her belly with some of her arms spread out and some folded under her body. She grumbled heavily and sat up to look up to him, "is that alright? Like... I'm done with this running around like a crazy person and smacking into the ground." She was talking totally normal while turning to look at him, half way through her statement she would now be peering up at him but her hair that normally covered her forehead was shifted to the side and a closed third eye could be seen at the very center of her forehead.* - Wed Dec  2 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) looked at his arm but wouldn't take it. She stood back up on her own and in doing so adjusted her hood and hair out of habit, her eye recovered, but she wasn't aware it was ever revealed. "Sorry... I'm weird about touching."* - Wed Dec  2 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'm not going to bite, so you can relax. You should know this by now. - Wed Dec  2 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah, I know. - Wed Dec  2 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) sat there with all of her arms in open view, set one and three tucked into her hoodie pocket, with set two folded back behind her body and holding the opposite arm's forearm. She blew a bubble and popped it silently while staring out feeling rather tired from all the shunshin training. When someone was passing into the group's territory---hell, who was she kidding? All of Amegakure was their territory, the shinobi and civilians stupid enough to stay behind were tolerated but deaths were common in the village from the group that resided in this particular mansion, and it was pretty well known. She didn't look like a shinobi, she bore no headband, but then again who has six arms and doesn't use that to some sort of fighting advantage?

Her chin shifted and she looked him up and down slowly to take in the sight of his clothing and noting any weapons. The fact he was a shinobi of this village was heavily noted and she was certain he was going to try and cause trouble, his words only further confirmed this suspicion.

"Be on your way."* - Wed Dec  2 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) refused to give him a reaction and simply stared at him with her placid expression as her gum shifted under her tongue. "I wasn't aware it was a joke... you just look to be searching for trouble... I don't want trouble."* - Wed Dec  2 08:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) squinted at him with a small frown and shifted her head so that she was only watching him out of periphereals. She began to pop her bubble gum once again...* - Wed Dec  2 08:41:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) grumbled and stood up and glared at him before folding her hands into the single seal but not activating her chakra. She walked away from the group to get some privacy so she wouldn't embarrass herself. Then she flew forward suddenly and ended up slamming into a tree with one side of her body. This of course sent her flying across the ground a great distance.* - Thu Dec  3 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) groned heavily and then looked back at the tree and widened her eyes. "Holy...fuu---" she stared wide eyed at the tree she had LITERALLY almost ripped in half, it was leaning off to the side and groaning from the tension. Clearly her durability was far beyond a tree's.* - Thu Dec  3 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: At least you don't feel sick. Right? - Thu Dec  3 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) shook her head and then folded her hands into seals again with a lower set of arms and rotating her upper shoulder in pain as it began to bruise.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) turned back around and rushed near his position. She might have slammed into him if he wasn't paying attention.* - Thu Dec  3 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) was now panting heavily as she shook him off and then darted forward again after another short handseal completion. She zipped forward and fell to the knee this time with a heavy gasp and sweat dripping off her brow faintly. "Nng.." When he had mentioned Akira she rolled her eyes now a good twenty feet away from him and yelled out. "She was near the house a while ago, Ichiro tried to attack her and Mizumi protected her. She was saying you were going to fuck her and I taught her to know that she is the defintion of a whore and she said she wants to do dirty things." * - Thu Dec  3 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) shook her head and turned to face him. "No, I don't thik they know... She's sort of idiotic... she didn't even try to move when the spear was aimed at her head....she'd be dead if Mizumi hadn't saved her." She then folded her hands into seals again and shot foward... yet again she slammed into another tree and went flying across the grass with her entire body aching and bruises from the landing and how she had torn up yet another tree.* - Thu Dec  3 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) was honestly pretty hurt from all the running around and she was chakra tired and nearly close to passing out. As Mizumi fell atop her she simply grunted in pain and left her face against the grass with it tickling her nose, lips, and cheeks. "Nng..."* - Thu Dec  3 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: What is on top of me? - Thu Dec  3 04:46:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) gagged inwardly as she heard what he said. She didn't comment back since right about now she could tell it was -someone- not -something- on top of her. She rolled over to face whoever it was and was trying to force them off but her body was too tired to give her strength. "Ugh... ----" then she felt the hand on her head and widened her eyes as he started to freaking -pet- her. "Oi! I'm not a pet!" she squirmed under Mizumi trying to get him off and trying to pull her head away from Kida's hand trying to -violate- her.* - Thu Dec  3 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: FUCK FUCK FUCK - Thu Dec  3 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) had been shaking her head a little bit too much trying to get Kida to stop touching her... because of this her bangs on her forehead had moved away and then she froze as she realized what she had done. Her third eye in the center of her forehead (it's closed) was revealed and she quickly tried to turn her head to the side to hide it from sight and force her hair to fall over her face but she wasn't sure if it was too late or not. Assumably all of this was happening as Kida was pushing Mizumi off of her body.* - Thu Dec  3 05:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) screamed out suddenly as the slimy...warm...but cooling dool slid down her face. She flat out -screamed-.* - Thu Dec  3 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) ignored Kida and was trying to rub the drool off on the grass as best she could. Getting dirt and green smudges onto her cheek in the process. "Nngng... gross, gross, gross." She rubbed it off over and over as she ignored Kida and continued to rub her cheek against the ground while trying not to pass out from being disgusted.* - Thu Dec  3 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Did she finally snap? - Thu Dec  3 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) grumbled and sat up and continued to rub her cheek but now with her sleeve and glaring at the two of them as they whispered about her. She couldn't hear what they were saying, her hood was for once down and her black and red highlighted hair was a mess all over the place with most of it covering her eyes to the lashes but her pupils were visible as she stared out at the two of them with a glare. "Gross....who drools on people...what were you even doing in the tree!"* - Thu Dec  3 05:33:13 2015
