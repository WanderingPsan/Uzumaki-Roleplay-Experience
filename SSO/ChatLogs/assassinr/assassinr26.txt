<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) stepped back as he kept throwing kunai's at her. "Erg..." She picked up the kunai and quickly took aim but this time it was much too hard for her to hit and the kunai flew past the target. "Ugh.... " grumbling as she waited for another kunai to be tossed to her. She felt around her pouch and then found her own and took aim again. She aimed at the spinning target and tried to just imagine it's single point that it was rotating on the center of gravity so that she would hit it no matter what. Thrusting the dagger forward it sliced right through the scroll and lodged deeply inside nearly tearing it in two from the damage it's received thus far.* - Sun Dec 13 11:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) 's reflexes weren't great. To catch the kunai's and avoid being cut she had to palm attack it on the side to throw off it's momentum and then caught the blade their after, doing the same with the other due to multiple arms. She held them both and then stared up fo only a second before sending out the kunai, two kunai at each scroll since she had her own weapons on her even if he insisted on throwing kunai at her now for some reason --dick. 

The first throw she missed pretty badly, the second at the same rotating scroll she managed to land the attack a bit off center. For the other stroll her other side of her body was controlling the kunai's clearly she wasn't left nor right handed but able to use all her hands equally for aiming and other tasks in the past he had seen easily enough from the time they spent together. 

She tossed the first kunai, hit it on the side but it wasn't good enough to her so she tossed the last of the four kunai but missed shy of a hair. Grumbling she looked over to him but she was learning quite a bit, the fact she had picked up what she had shown her talent for learning greatly.* - Sun Dec 13 11:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) glared at Sogeki and pulled out five kunai and held them in her respective hands. She focused and then started to take aim, "Fucking bullshit..." grumbled out loudly enough for the two in the area to hear as she shot the first kunai off, then another, and a third, and a fourth, and finally a last one. The firt four manated to hit the target or around it within the rings but the last one had hit the edge of the scroll's hard edge and made a 'tink' sound before dropping fast to the ground.* - Sun Dec 13 11:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) wasn't tired at all since throwing kunai wasn't all that strenuous. "Yes, thank heavens, this was dull."* - Sun Dec 13 11:46:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) took the bow into hand and then held the string loosely, as he was explaining and adding plurals on in a delay she snickered some and pressed her lips together trying to stay serious. She closed her third eye for a moment since it was causing her pain and rested it a bit while he spoke. <He's a really serious teacher, no jokes or anything... just straight to the point, who knew, I thought he would be a pervert.> 

She pulled the string back with the arrow against the curve of the metal and the slot at the end of the arrow around the wire as she pulled back as far as she could manage, which wasn't far, and then struggled to hold it as she aimed and then let the arrow fly ---- fifteen feet away before falling to the ground. Her chest made a sad sound as she was disappointed in herself, she was looking forward to making her first shot good.* - Sun Dec 13 12:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) blinked a bit in shock and looked up at him with eyes of wonder of why he had told her 'good job'. She was surprised he was so supportive. She sighed out as she lined up the arrow and then closed her eyes for a moment before reopening them, this time with her third eye open once again. She placed two more hands on the bow with two pulling the string back and three on the bow. She shifted a it in her stance, it wasn't how he would likely stand due to how many arms she had on the weapon. After she adjusted the hieght of where she was holding the bow and arrow she inhaled and then breathed out through her lips and released the string as the arrow went flying forward. 

She lowered the bow some and watched as it struck the second inner most target on the markings on the scroll. Soon after she looked up to Sogeki and couldn't hide the small smile forming on her lips. She reached into his quiver and pulled out another arrow quickly drawing it the same as she had just done and exhaling out before releasing the arrow and letting it fly again. It landed slightly closer in on the North East edge of the second to most middle curve.* - Sun Dec 13 12:36:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) took up the next arrow as he presented it to her and made the adjustments he stated. Nodding along to his words and her eyes had lingered on Akito for a moment but she quickly looked away trying to assure he wouldn't see her third eye but there was a chance he had. Since she had all the gear in her hands she couldn't just randomly pull up her hood and ove her bangs back into her face. She left them as they were and then took aim and fired off the shot with her body heavily balanced into her soles and it was obvious that there were a lot of factors of how Kariudo held herself that made her perfect for using a bow. 

The first arrow struck, and hit the dead bullseye, she widened her smile and was going to say something but Akito and Sogeki began to speak so she simply took another arrow and pulled it back. Just as she was about to release the arrow, Sogeki said his last few words 'I may never return' causing her to lack focus and the string of the bow made a 'twang' sound as it was released and the arrow went far off course. "Drat...what are you two talking about?"* - Sun Dec 13 12:52:12 2015
