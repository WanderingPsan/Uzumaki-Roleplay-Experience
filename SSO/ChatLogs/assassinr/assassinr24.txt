<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) looked up to him, she was nervous to know what it would be that he had wanted to do. When he simply kissed her --- romantically as fuck by the way--- she inhaled sharply through her nostrils and her eyes fluttered closed and her heart skipped a beat at the fact all he wanted was a kiss. When it broke she licked over her lips tasting his lips on her own and slowly opened her eyes with a hazy look of enjoyment. "That's all? A kiss? That's what you wanted most?"* - Mon Dec  7 09:12:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) had the white rum pushed in front of her, she sniffed it and then squinted and leaned her head away.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) stood up and walked over towards him, she was hesitant only becuase of that look in his eyes.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) took the liquor and then hesitantly brought it to her lips but she struggled to get herself to drink it. It smelled so bad... eventually she took a sip and then nearly gagged so hard her entire body lurched a bit foward. She force the bottle onto the table and turned in against his chest as she tried to recover, it was so terrible! Her face was flushing red from the liquor in her system, even a little bit going down her throat burned... * - Mon Dec  7 09:40:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) was panting heavily as her hands had been used in gestures and waved all about in her uproar. "You sealed my tongue so I couldn't speak of Kumogakure! You betrayed -me-, I didn't complain after that one conversation and I've had to tip toe around them ever since!"* - Mon Dec  7 23:11:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: That's IT. - Mon Dec  7 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes but hadn't jumped back from him when he grabbed her. There was a moment she nearly did but had stopped herself due to the look in his eyes... she trusted him far to much. Turning her head away as he tried to look in her eyes she shamefully was lectured and jutted out her lower lip as her cheeks turned pink from thoughts in her head she tried not to think of. "I... " she didn't understand half of what he had said about it being the Raikage who betrayed him, he was the Raikage so that was confusing.

"I know I don't..." whispered out pathetically and she tried to think of a way to solve this issue. After he had released her, the girl's head lowered down and she sighed out, "interrogate me."* - Mon Dec  7 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: To do.. - Mon Dec  7 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...yes... you can... - Mon Dec  7 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Something. - Mon Dec  7 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm giving permission for interrogation. - Mon Dec  7 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) didn't know about the jutsu, she was requesting real traditional interrogation.* - Mon Dec  7 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: . . .. ...I see.... - Mon Dec  7 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) was wary when he formed handseals, was he going to hurt her first? She closed her eyes tightly soon after looking at the seals in fear but then she was forced into a different  'dimension' of her mind's eye. She opened her eyes again looking up at him but everything else was dark and blurred around her, no pain.. just nothing but his words and image. <What is this? No pain?> She then cleared her throat and spoke up to answer him immediately as she was forced to speak. "Ichiro is of my bloodline, because of that he can use the same techniques I use but isn't very good at them. He uses taijutsu and is a care free spirit, he simply goes with the flow and does what makes him feel happy. He feels 'right' with the group he is staying with, it isn't his faction. He is a body guard to the woman. She is not the leader either, there is a 'Master' but he is never present with the group, I have no seen him since the first day I met the group. Ichiro isn't hiding anything that I know of but if he is, he is hiding it from me too. He is willing to eat human flesh without remorse if he is hungry, and he is willing to commit evil acts if it means making him happy. The only thing I do while I am there is train with them, make food for them occasionally, and they tease me. As I told you before I am treated like a little sister or 'mascot'. It makes spying relatively easy."* - Mon Dec  7 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) heard his words and continued to be unmoving as her body trembled from the questions asked, "I am utterly loyal to Eiyu Minatabi, if there was another kage I'm not certain how loyal I would be... except that you said you'd be a shinobi and as you were loyal to this village then... so would I be loyal to the village. ---Sogeki is also undyingly loyal to the village.. so I remain loyal because of him aswell. It is the -people- that make me loyal to Kumogakure, not the location or morals of the village. I am not originally from Kumogakure but from the land of rice... because of that it never really felt as if this is truly my 'home'. It feels that the people I live with now are my 'home' because it feels 'right' but I still remain loyal to the people I care for in this village. The loyalty I have to my brother is a bond of sibling attraction, nothing my brother does, good or evil, is wrong in my eyes because he is and always will be my brother. It is why I have gone through such an effort to assure that Kumogakure is untouched by the group I live with and spy on." She gasped out from being out of breath and hesitated now.

When she got to the next question she tried to resist and because of that began to feel pain. Her body shuddered and ached as she tried to resist screaming.* - Mon Dec  7 23:42:56 2015

She knew if she lied she would feel more pain, it was obvious just by her resisting to speak in the first place. "I am entirely loyal to Eiyu Minatabi, I would die for him if I thought his life was needed longer than mine in this world, I...I was asked once if I would d---" she tried to resist again and screamed out now.

Panting heavily as her body was forced to remain standing but was slumped in the shoulders and sweat upon her brow. "Even though I am with Sogeki, I have feelings for Eiyu Minatabi, I care deeply for h-him and in another r-reality would have been with him had S-sogeki not come along."* - Mon Dec  7 23:50:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) gasped as she was quickly spun and nearly tripped over her own feet out of surprise. When his head rested on her shoulder she peered at him from the corner of her eyes and gulped hard at his words with a sudden inhale of breath and a long shudder throughout her body.* - Tue Dec  8 06:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) groaned and her knee's went weak as she pressed back into his body. She hadn't even realized his hands were halfway up her shirt by the time she came back to the ground from feeling high just from a simple kiss to her ear. As his hands cupped her bra covered breasts she parted her lips and leaned her head back against his chest as she tried to ignore the nerves and any sensations of wanting things to stop, she had for the most part entered a mentality that when Sogeki touched her it was okay... after all it had been a long time.* - Tue Dec  8 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) squirmed back against him as he slipped his hand down her pants and into her panties. She looked around nervously and kept a look out as her hands hung at her sides and one set was back and holding onto his hips as she panted out and gave tiny moans out. He was getting louder ones once and a while but as soon as he eased back she forced herself to quiet down so she could feel more. "Nngng..." groaning out as he continued to toy with her body and Kari whispered out in a forced whine, "I-i thought w-we weren't going to do it here?" Course, Sogeki never agreed to leave....* - Tue Dec  8 07:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) reached out for his hand and pulled him back for a deep kiss as she pressed up against him with passion and longing. After the kiss was given she gave him another small peck and whispered again, "be a savage for me, handsome."* - Tue Dec  8 08:07:15 2015
