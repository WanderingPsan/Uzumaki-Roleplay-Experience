<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) nodded and then started to walk North between the houses and out of the village to the North Eastern Falls.* - Wed Dec  9 08:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) got a little fucking lost, she wasn't very good with this area since usually she was visiting Kumogakure more than not. "Right uh, this probably will work, do you just use your sword?"* - Wed Dec  9 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow at him saying he could hold his own in a fist fight. "Alright, what have you been working on lately?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) really meant the no ninjutsu on her part and then rush towards him in a charge and aimed to sent out a kick between his legs with a sweep outwards to try and seperate his legs and throw off his balance as all of her balance was perfectly on her other foot. With quick jabs her hands started thrusting out in rapid attacks with all of her arms to his shoulders, chest, belly, and such. She wasn't hitting any vital areas as she normally would, she wanted to see how he would react before going too hard on him.* - Wed Dec  9 08:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) cringed some as his shin crashing with her own hurt some. She was shocked... that he managed to cause her some pain as it radiated up through her leg. She pulled the leg back and eyed him carefully. She got a few of her hits out and then cringed as he slammed his fist against such a tender area on a female. "Tch.." 

She leaned back and rolled the shoulder he had struck before aiming to send on fist into his low gut just above his groin and another one aimed to try and uppercut him as her other fists became palms and tried to knock his blocking arms out of the way.* - Wed Dec  9 08:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) || OH SHIT--- Kari widened her eyes and stepped back, she didn't think her attack would be so successful. As he seemed to recover so quickly though her eyes narrows, instead of bringing up her arms as he had predicted she might she leaned back reflexively to avoid the slap but he did manage to kick out towards her torso and arms only for a few of them to grip onto his leg in several different places with fingers pressing in against muscles and nerves at various places along her body. 

It only took a few seconds and a shooting pain and then numbing went up his leg. he managed to make her body hurt but she did not stumble back, instead when she had finished the assault on his leg she tossed him back with force by the leg to force him onto his backside.* - Wed Dec  9 09:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) thinks: Attacking her upper body is pointless.. - Wed Dec  9 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) thinks: Going for her legs is my best option, but the lower set of her arms can protect that.. - Wed Dec  9 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) thinks: Going for the arms in general is suicide. - Wed Dec  9 09:11:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) || <Oh not done?> She widened her eyes and tried to move away but wasn't fast enough and he scooped her up, she widened her eyes even further and pushed all her arms against his body and then used her upper arm with a bent elbow and cocked it to the opposite side of her body to try and clock him in the temple with her elbow and forearm.* - Wed Dec  9 09:18:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) hit the ground hard, she gasped out and choked as the breath was forced out of her lungs. She rolled over onto her front and was on all fours as she hyperventilated and tried to regain herself.* - Wed Dec  9 09:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) rolled over on her side and then back as she panted out, "F-fuck... not doing that ever again."* - Wed Dec  9 09:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) chuckled through panting breathes and eyes closed. "You okay? I hope I didn't give you a concussion."* - Wed Dec  9 09:27:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) walked up to the area, and as she looked him over it was easy to quickly notice the new tattoo since she knew his form pretty well by now. Walking over and sitting down beside him she stared out across the valley as if she had simply been here only a moment ago sitting with him rather than being gone several months.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) let the paper flutter to the floor and wrapped her upper arms around the back of his neck and pulled him in.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) || For a moment she had a little panic attack, how he shook his head worried her quite a bit. She bit down on her tongue as those few moments felt like a life time as she waited for a bigger reaction than a simple shaking of his head. When his hand came up and rest on her cheek she sighed out through flared nostril's and then felt her eyes burn as he nodded and said those four enormous words back to her. 

Biting down on her lip and gasping out with a soft laugh she leaned forward and pressed her lips into his and kissed him with passion and several small kisses in a row. Her throat whining out as she wrapped her arms tighter up around the back of his neck to pull him close.* - Fri Dec 11 08:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) tilted her head up with his guidance and tilted her head off to the side to match his own.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) rest there against his chest with warm breath against his neck in the cold mountain air and trembled slightly from her adrenaline and the cold.

"S-s-s-sogek-kiiiiiii!!!" Whining out as she tried to get free helplessly, what was it about being tickled that made a person so weak feeling?* - Fri Dec 11 11:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) jumped every time he poked her side and tried to squirm. By now some of her hands were digging nails into his arms and others were trying to pull his arm off and stop the other from poking her. She had yet to notice Eiyu of course because of the tickle assault. "P-pleaaaaaase! S-stawwwwwp!"* - Fri Dec 11 11:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) feeling him slow down eased off her tension and he had just saved himself from an uppercut! She bit down on her lip and sighed out slumping against his hand that was pulling her sweater up a bit to reveal her lower belly and belly button.* - Fri Dec 11 12:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) thinks: Once again this has turned out to be rather....dissappointing...might have to see what other villages are up to. - Fri Dec 11 13:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) poked Sogeki's side while whistling innocently.* - Sat Dec 12 05:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) puased her whistling and looked at him innocently, "Hm?~"* - Sat Dec 12 05:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes and  looked away quickly as her cheeks pinkened up.* - Sat Dec 12 05:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt herself being pulled onto his lap and rested back into him with some tenseness resting in her form. She felt the kiss and that helped her relax a small amount but she was fairly on edge in fear of what he might do. "Nothing nothing, how about we train?"* - Sat Dec 12 05:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Nngn... - Sat Dec 12 05:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Anything but sitting around. - Sat Dec 12 05:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You could test new poisons... or... we could just do a good work out... or we could spar... but that seems pointless nowadays... I can't beat you anymore. - Sat Dec 12 05:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Can't beat me..? - Sat Dec 12 05:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Haha, you're kidding. - Sat Dec 12 05:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: And.. new poisons.. - Sat Dec 12 05:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I have a few new techniques, mastered bout one and a half. - Sat Dec 12 05:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Do you make new poisons? I wasn't sure. - Sat Dec 12 05:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh.. I wouldn't say -new-.. just stronger. - Sat Dec 12 05:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...but you kill things with the other one. - Sat Dec 12 05:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: True.. I just have to be more careful with the latest version of my poison. - Sat Dec 12 05:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Besides. - Sat Dec 12 05:43:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmmm.. - Sat Dec 12 05:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) squinted at him. "We could test the poison if you need to."* - Sat Dec 12 05:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) blinked a bit, "you don't want to test it?"* - Sat Dec 12 05:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: What way then? - Sat Dec 12 05:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I mean normally you use poison.... to do things sexually to me... is it something else you had in mind? - Sat Dec 12 05:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Something ....dangerous? - Sat Dec 12 05:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It's exactly -that- which I want to use the poison for.. I mean, just the thought of using this advanced version is dangerous and., and an extreme turn on. - Sat Dec 12 05:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I mean.... could it kill me? - Sat Dec 12 05:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: If I use too much, yes.. course I wouldn't even make it get to that point. - Sat Dec 12 05:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ....what will it do to me? - Sat Dec 12 05:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: The same thing. I have it under control. - Sat Dec 12 06:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ...Then how is it more powerful? It doesn't even do a different thing? Lame. - Sat Dec 12 06:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .......................... - Sat Dec 12 06:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: #Nope. - Sat Dec 12 06:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) tried to get up, fuck invisible poison.* - Sat Dec 12 06:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) inhaled sharply and froze as he held it against her bicep. "How is it invisible?"* - Sat Dec 12 06:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) trembled a bit as he ran the sharp edge over her arm but didn't cut her. "S-sogeki.....nng...that's... possible?"* - Sat Dec 12 06:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) groaned out in embarrassment and her eyes darted around to see if anyone was in the area. "W-what are you doing? Doing that out here?!" Whispering in distress as she trembled and felt heat coursing through her body from the pleasure as he touched her in places she hadn't been touched in several months.* - Sat Dec 12 06:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Giving me a wedgy...hmph. - Sat Dec 12 06:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: O-okay... your p-place... just cut it out with this public stuff...ngng.. - Sat Dec 12 06:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) groaned at his comment about being caught. When he laid her down she propped herself up on her elbows and looked up towards him. She stared up at him and as the arrow pressed against her chest she wasn't as worried since it was through clothing. All the same her heart was beating heavily.* - Sat Dec 12 06:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) trembled as she had herself propped up and felt him running the arrow down her body and then lifting her sweater. "Nng..." she bit down on her lip and watched him reveal her toned belly and then pricked her side. She jerked a bit and hissed out as the prick managed to break her skin. All the while she was trying to focus on him as much as possible while he was pulling her top further and further up threatening to reveal her lower portion of bra--which she had recently bought something nice for Sogeki... she wore a black lacy bra instead of her normal sports bra.* - Sat Dec 12 06:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) looked away and turned light red in her cheeks with embarrassment. "I thought... you might like this better, I know it's not much but it's... more than what I normally do..yeah?" She cut off as one of her elbows slipped and she started to fall back from weakness in her muscles. "Erg..." she hated and loved the sensation of what happens when she is poisoned. She inhaled sharply at the warmth of his tongue going over her breast and leaned her head back some with a shudder. "S-sogeki... what do you have planned exactly?" She was a bit nervous since he sounded like he had big plans for this time around.* - Sat Dec 12 06:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes as she felt her body weaken further. "Something -who- knew?" She began to panic at him mentioning someone else, a man no less! She trembled but soon enough lost all control over her body. As he clamped his lips about her nipple she gasped out and was feeling a small amount of residual feeling still residing in her. She leaned her head off to the side against the pillow and clenched her fingers. With fingers trailing down her body and into her pants, he'd be able to feel her lacy black panties to match the new bra. Her soft bare lips warm to the touch and his fingertips made a tingle go through her entire form with a heavy exhale.* - Sat Dec 12 07:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) growled under her breath as she tried to move to grip his hair or flick him but was forced to lay still. "Ugh... WHO? You better not bring anyone in here... I swear Sogeki...this isn't funny," she sounded like she was putting on a tough girl angry act but really she was terrified if he would ever try something like what had just flashed through her mind. His fingers invading her cleft only made her feel more violated and a shudder of nerves went through her body as she tried to keep it together. "Nng..." * - Sat Dec 12 07:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) opened her eyes wider at how Sogeki stated it so bluntly. She watched him for a short while curiously, he clearly had a good hold on her... in terms of emotions.  When he pressed upon her clit she gasped out with a tiny whining sound going high pitch. As the very tip of his finger slid inside of her warm and tight walls she trembled and found herself having a hard time holding still---course, that would be if she could move at all..instead her body twitched in reaction to his stroking. 

Her eyes suddenly shot open at his last few words, "I-in my face? H-heh....o-oh..." She tried to play it off like it wasn't a big deal.* - Sat Dec 12 07:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) watched him licking his fingers clean and she wanted to gag just from the sight of it. She had to close her eyes halfway through just to resist the noise in her throat. She reopened her eyes and looked up to him ---but then his cock was in her face! She panicked and paled ghost white as she could -smell- his groin as he stroked over her lower face and bobbed his cock up and down. She tried to force her lips together tightly and groaned as he was able to easily open her mouth and jaw so that her lips were parted and her tongue lax behind her lower row of teeth. She whined out some and felt violated extremely so now, she wanted to stop him but couldn't. Kari's entire body trembled as she stared at his cock in fear and terrible ideas went through her head about the taste... about choking to death... and  more.* - Sat Dec 12 08:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whined out lightly and closed her eyes tightly just as his cock touched her bottom lip's inner curve. When he pulled back she opened her eyes thinking he had decided against it but then his cock was being shoved into her mouth and against her tongue! She could taste the salty sex flavor and retracted her tongue as a tiny gag sound was made out of instinct of something foreign she didn't recognize being on her taste buds. She could hold down her spicy food but was a little baby about having a little head in her mouth it seemed. She let out a low growly groan of anquish but didn't move as he invaded her mouth and left a small mark of his sex on her lips and tongue.* - Sat Dec 12 08:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) groaned out again and jerked a bit as he slid more of his cock into her mouth and now she couldn't stop him from touching her tongue. She tried to get her tongue away but only ended rubbing it against his head as she tried to push her tongue to the left and then right to get away. A heavy gag forced her chest to hitch and her head to shift forward for a moment as she tried to hold it together. "Nnngngngngg... soogjjj--" she tried to talk but couldn't from how he was holding her chin and stuffing her mouth.* - Sat Dec 12 08:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes tightly and felt them burning from her sinuses shifting from the motion of her mouth and the start of the back of her throat. She gasped out for air through her nostrils with flaring cartlidge and then looked up at him in panic as he started to face fuck her back and forth. She was thinking, <This is enough! Too much, too fast!> She twitched with her head trying to pull away but being very unsuccessful as she groaned out with some anger this time. "S-soooogjjjekkkehhh.. n-nnnnoooooahhhh Mooooarrr.." whining out helplessly which he might just like more than what she already was behaving like with her whines but she gagged heavily a few more times the further he went back into her throat and she felt her body becoming hot from shame and the feeling of trying to stop from gagging.* - Sat Dec 12 08:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt herself getting under control as he pulled back and her lips tried to close but couldn't entirely since she was lacking total control at the moment. Her lips remained coated in saliva and drool slowly slid down her lip and onto her chin and from the corner of her mouth along her cheek from the small amount of face fucking. She shifted her eyes in shame as his cock rested on her bottom lip and she breathed out against the tip since every time she tried to breathe through her nose now, all she could smell was cock.* - Sat Dec 12 09:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) looked up to him as he was pulling away fully now. The drool driping down her jaw and making her feel dirty... she really felt filthy now just from having her face fucked. As he flipped her over she grunted and closed her eyes for a moment and the drool was rubbed against the pillow beneath her face. "Stupid...fucking...poison," muttered out as she wanted to be able to move... to act, to speak more clearly rather than slurring her words. She tried to speak up as she stared at the wall, "H-hey... wh-what are you doing now?" she gasped out suddenly and moaned as he flicked her clit a few times and then started to torment her with his tongue. Shudders went through her body and she tried to keep her moans to herself but soon enough they were singing out for Sogeki's efforts in praise. She wanted to talk about what he had done to her mouth, but he wasn't giving her the chance.* - Sat Dec 12 09:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) grumbled in pleasure as he gripped her large cheeks but when he slapped her she growled out with a small hiss of pain. When he started to tongue fuck her she gasped out heavily in hot pants against the pillow and then moaned out a length high pitched moan as the tongue fucking quickly managed to push her to the edge of her little climax cliff. "S-sogekiiiiiii, ughhghhhmn..."* - Sat Dec 12 09:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) trembled heavier and throughout her lack of movement and twitches she wanted to desperately move! She wanted to push her hips up against his face and bend over for him to go deeper... to lick what hasn't been licked. The thought of how gross she found it left her mind and she focused on the feeling rather than the thoughts or sounds of his slurping. It wasn't until he started to suck at her outer lips as a whole that a second orgasm screamed through her as she trembled like she was seizing and moaned out loudly enough to echo off the corner of the room. 

"FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK, OOOH... S-SOGEKI..HOLY...WHAT...ARE YOU? NNGNG.."

She rubbed her nose against the pillow only able to move a small amount as drool kept her face wet and she didn't care how filthy she felt in that moment, it was worth it for this....* - Sat Dec 12 10:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) walked in the house carrying several grocery bags and then froze instantly when she realized someone was in the house. Running her eyes over the area and seeing just who it was she rose a brow. "Oh...its just you guys..." <how long has it even been?>* - Sat Dec 12 22:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yakato, Midori(MadameShredder) says: Oh look. - Sat Dec 12 22:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yakato, Midori(MadameShredder) says: Did I take your first love by chance? - Sat Dec 12 22:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) grumbled and shuffled off for the kitchen.* - Sat Dec 12 22:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .....You stole my first kiss. - Sat Dec 12 22:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) walked into the kitchen and sat all the bags on the counter. She pulled out the items and went to work, there was sea bass, with a coconut and a variety of other fruits, spices, and such. She put on a skillet, a pot, and pulled out a cutting board. Running some water she started to clean the fish and then place it in the fridge as she prepared the spicy green curry base. Cutting fresh herbs, adding ground spices, cracking open the coconut, and generally preparing the meal that took a long while until the curry sauce was bubbling in a sweet extra spicy way. Green curry was the spiciest curry in the world, so they were in for a surprise. 

She then went to searing the fish and preparing steamed rice. When all of the meal was finished off she plated each one and cleaned off the table. Setting out a large bottle of sake and a pitcher of water with four glasses and a steaming hot plate of food for each person that likely was going to be way too spicy for any of them to eat unless they -really- liked spicy food. --- at least it was delicious?* - Sat Dec 12 22:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) took up her fork and started to eat easily enough. She seemed to greatly enjoy the spicy food and devoured it at a rather fast pace. When her social attitude was brought up she pushed some of the fish around on the plate. "I uh... traveling a lot, training... making friends... lots...and lots of training mostly--but I wanted to hear about your time traveling more." She left out a few details but that was for later conversations. * - Sat Dec 12 22:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) hummed gently and leaned her head back with a wide smile as her hood fell back, "he doesn't want to kill you.~ Ahhhhhhh, this is awesome.~"* - Sun Dec 13 08:10:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Didn't think you'd ever want to learn that. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Doesn't seem like your thing- - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Let's get started. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Right now. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ---...uh. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Okay. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why did he look at me like that? - Sun Dec 13 08:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) frowned at him handing her kunai. "Seriously? A kunai lesson? What am I? In the academy?" She rolled her eyes and took the kunai's. She took aim and she wasn't the best shot but because she knew where to target weak points on things she managed to hit a few targets but missed more than she actually hit. Pursing her lips she walked over and retrieved the kunai as she tripped them out of the scrolls and then walked back to his side.

Reaching up to her bangs she combed them back out of her eyes and put on her headband to hold her hair back and opened her third eye. Knowing this would help her hone in on her targets. As she took aim, her attacks were faster, more precise and she was able to hit more targets than miss but she still was pretty off center since she needed work. 

She did the repetative process of walking over towards the scrolls and ripping the blades out and going back to her position beside Sogeki. Every so often she would ask little questions about how to hold the weapon better, how to curve an attack or how to focus better on her target and where to aim properly to hit her mark.

Kari yawned out showing her extremely sharp teeth and then licked over them one by one as she took aim again. She was growing bored and was cycling through her arms to try and train each of them. It was pretty hard to be training so many arms but she had pretty good focus all things considered with how bad of a shot she was. The fact she was hitting the targets at all was amazing and it was showing how her progress grew by using her third eye as an aid to focus in on her blind spot and cancel it out between her eyes.

She paused a bit and looked up towards Sogeki, "oi, so why is this necessary? This is totally different type of aiming...." She yawned a bit again and tossed another kunai. "Let's at least try to make this more interesting somehow.... how you been doing? You wanna play a game or something to keep it interesting?"* - Sun Dec 13 09:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) squinted at what he was doing to the one target... she muttered 'fuck that shit'. She saw that he wasn't moving and lowered her lids more in irritation. Sighing out she held up a kunai and tried to aim but it was moving pretty fast. She tried to follow it with a small bob of her hand back and forth back and forth as she was following the curve to get the timing right and to keep her hand moving and fluid so she could attack swiftly at the right moment. Her eyes and third eye were focused as she had no idea of Akito's presence as all of her focus was tunnel visioned in on the scroll rotating ahead of her.

Tossing the kunai suddenly it wizzed through the air as she watched it fly and watched as it sliced through the side of the scroll but didn't lodge into it... on top of this...the kunai had flown between Sogeki's form and the scroll making this quite a dangerous miss, though he wouldn't be hit.* - Sun Dec 13 10:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) stepped back as the kunai was thrown at her feet. Crouching down she ripped the kunai out of the training tile and then shifted it in her grip for a more comfortable hold. Muttering out, "that's what I'm already doing..." of course from this position Akito wouldn't be able to see her eye for now. She did the same as before, bobbing her hand back and forth to track the movements and then moving a bit ahead of the scroll to be attacking a bit ahead of it's spinning. Once she had done this for several minutes she tossed the kunai again with great focus and ----the kunai goes straight for Sogeki. "LOOK OUT!"* - Sun Dec 13 10:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) thinks: How can she not hit it? - Sun Dec 13 10:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ... - Sun Dec 13 10:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You're joking. - Sun Dec 13 10:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Tick tock, tick tock. - Sun Dec 13 10:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) grumbled and then only had a few seconds to aim before having to toss the kunai. She snagged past it and then pulled out another kunai and took aim again the closer and closer it was getting to the ground between the two of them. She shot another kunai out and this time she hit the bullseye and sent the scroll flying a bit up into the air from the momentum before falling to the ground again. Her voice sing songed a bit as she looked over to Sogeki, "this...is how...we dooooo it.~"* - Sun Dec 13 10:53:36 2015
