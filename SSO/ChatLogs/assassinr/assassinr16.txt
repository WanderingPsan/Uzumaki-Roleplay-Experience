Spreading it against her opposite palm she formed handseals and touched the gound as dark red seals spread out on the ground around her. She stood back up fully and a giant black widow looking spider climbed out from her hood and across her cleavage and finally onto her shoulder, watching Sogeki carefully.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) froze as the arrow as pointed at her and she slowly rose her chin the closer he got to her neck. She was beathing steadily and calm. She heard his words and it intimidated her. She flushed a deep red about him having his way with her when she was openly aware of what was going on but couldn't move. Deep down part of her LIKED this.* - Sun Nov 29 06:34:40 2015

Her body trembled some from what he was saying and then on top of that from what he MIGHT do. As he applied more pressure she groaned and her eyes shown how distressed she was. Speaking up she admitted to him. "It isn't you doing.... it.... I'm ..." she shifted her gaze away feeling his lips practically on her own. "I scared I will like it...."* - Sun Nov 29 06:46:36 2015
