<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't kiss and tell. - Fri Nov 13 14:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) inhaled sharply and eased back an inch or two away from him so her back was arched and her eyes remained down and watching his lips that were so close.* - Fri Nov 13 15:00:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: No one.. Which makes this a bit more fun.~ - Fri Nov 13 15:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Though you are strange. - Fri Nov 13 15:17:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Strange is misunderstood. Once I'm fully understood, my weaknesses are exploited. - Fri Nov 13 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Only a few people in my life I allow to exploit me. - Fri Nov 13 15:21:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) spoke again, "since I have met you, you showed me something only one other person has seen, you've -allowed- me to have a knife to your throat, I know you allowed me after what I saw with that man near Konoha. You are of my birthright, you have a dark history with lovers or you wouldn't be trying so hard to distract yourself with someone who doesn't want you, such as myself. You also possess the ability to somehow control snakes, likely by contract, a covetted contract to even have ever signed and somehow I think you just might be the contract holder. Am I right?"* - Fri Nov 13 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) pursed her lips, "you ignored the rest, hiding something?"* - Fri Nov 13 15:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes as what the issue was with his lovers was more complex than she might have imagined, "you are waiting for someone...waiting -four years-? You love them that much?"* - Fri Nov 13 15:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't care too much about the other woman in the first place but wasn't to understand that if he was willing to wait that long for a -chance- then he certainly had strong feelings. "So you just want sex."* - Fri Nov 13 15:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Explain. - Fri Nov 13 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I guess you can call it.. more than friends with benefits..? - Fri Nov 13 15:48:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn.. okay, take your time. - Fri Nov 13 15:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) crossed her arms in wait.* - Fri Nov 13 15:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Why you? Can't answer that. That's too close to a rhetorica question-like feeling. But the feeling im looking for involves compassion.. - Fri Nov 13 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just not -only- compassion. - Fri Nov 13 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Maybe.. just maybe actual lust back? - Fri Nov 13 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...how is it rhetorical? - Fri Nov 13 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's not, but it gives off the vibe. - Fri Nov 13 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just a question that can't be answered right. - Fri Nov 13 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...I don't see why not. - Fri Nov 13 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Why you? Because it just seems right that it -is- you. - Fri Nov 13 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) craned her head to the side and shifted her weight onto one foot under the water so her hip jutted out as she stood there. "Because of our first business meeting? Or because I'm so 'cold'."* - Fri Nov 13 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The business meeting with you on my lap was strictly for you. I'm not going to say that temptation wasn't there but I wanted to see you through to the end.. - Fri Nov 13 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And you being so cold just makes me want to warm you up.~ - Fri Nov 13 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Then why do -I- feel right? - Fri Nov 13 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because you don't feel wrong. - Fri Nov 13 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: That is not a very good reason I hope you know. - Fri Nov 13 15:54:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Say it. - Fri Nov 13 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You.. have actual emotions and feelings.. - Fri Nov 13 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And know.. what you want.. - Fri Nov 13 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .....I see. - Fri Nov 13 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: The fact I am rude, selfish, and other negative things don't bother you? - Fri Nov 13 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Nope. - Fri Nov 13 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Everyone is like that in some way. - Fri Nov 13 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: So your excuse is I am just more of those than others? - Fri Nov 13 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're more independant - Fri Nov 13 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thought on this before lowering her arms and stepping towards him. She reached out for his chin and then aimed to plant her lips upon his own. She didn't kiss sweetly, or gentle, but rather lightly agressive and explorative. Once she had seen what she wanted out of the kiss if he did nothing else it was broken and Eri released his chin while licking over her lips.* - Fri Nov 13 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded back and forth some, "not bad, I'll think on it." She moved past him as she intentionally had her shoulder, arm, and leg brush against him before stepping out onto the shoreline.* - Fri Nov 13 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) made her way across the grass off of the wet shore and then laid down on the grass to dry off. "I'm an eel, I wait for my prey to come to me." Her eyes glanced up to him from where she was laying.* - Fri Nov 13 16:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) watched him shamelessly, "is that a challenge?"* - Fri Nov 13 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: How much are we betting? - Fri Nov 13 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I have four million in my pants pocket right now. - Fri Nov 13 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Fri Nov 13 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Guess I better not lose. - Fri Nov 13 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Implying you have a chance at winning?~ - Fri Nov 13 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: If I do lose what do you want in return, I can't pay that. - Fri Nov 13 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't know yet. I'll think on the spot -when- I win. - Fri Nov 13 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...that's not fair. - Fri Nov 13 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I find it funny that you think I'll actually make you bet anything. - Fri Nov 13 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: This just a free pass for my to cop some feels and see what your breaking point is. - Fri Nov 13 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ... - Fri Nov 13 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You think it's fair to even play this game? Of course you won't stop me if I touch you. - Fri Nov 13 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Actually.. not true. - Fri Nov 13 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm somewhat.. ticklish.. - Fri Nov 13 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Why you making it harder on yourself? - Fri Nov 13 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I like the challenge. - Fri Nov 13 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...very well. - Fri Nov 13 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You starting or do you want me to go first and have you lose sooner?~ - Fri Nov 13 16:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: How do you want to play? - Fri Nov 13 16:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: One thing at a time back an forth? - Fri Nov 13 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Sure, sure. - Fri Nov 13 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded and then stood up quickly and headed over to him. She pressed her front up against him and peered up into his eyes as her right hand started at his waist and slowly began to work it's way lower and behind him until it was slipping beneath his boxers. Her fingers brushing over the curvature of his ass cheeks and threatening to go between as she explored his skin to speed up his heart rate. She was watching his eyes and expression as well as feeling his heart with her own chest. She wasn't done, but trying to see something if it would show before moving on to her true target.* - Fri Nov 13 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow with a sly cheshire grin, "Problem?" Her heart was racing too but unlike him? She didn't mind her ass being touched. Eri certainly was a cheat, big things were on the line after all, he should have known.~ Her fingers tried to slowly sing between his cheeks towards their destination, she did so slowly enough to torture him but also give him time to give up.* - Fri Nov 13 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) chuckled lightly,"oh you like this do you? Then I won't bother taking it slow.~" She pressed her fingers the rest of the way between his crack so that her index and middle finger were pressed firmly against his pucker. He sure was being brave.~* - Fri Nov 13 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gasped out as he pushed his fingers in. Her eyes fluttered closed and then reopened as she whispered, "You made a fatal mistake, Ortho. You assumed I was shy, when I was all pretend.~" Biting down hard on her lip as she slowly pushed harder and harder to threaten endering him if he didn't call off the game.* - Fri Nov 13 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) froze what she was doing and slowly puled away from him and her hands from out of his boxers as she pulled further away from him and rolled her neck. "I believe you owe me four million.~"* - Fri Nov 13 16:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh? - Fri Nov 13 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov 13 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: What is that? - Fri Nov 13 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Let me show you.~ - Fri Nov 13 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I told you I would think about it. - Fri Nov 13 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Didn't say I was going to try and fuck you. - Fri Nov 13 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Such harsh words.~ - Fri Nov 13 16:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Don't act like you don't like it. - Fri Nov 13 16:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) chuckled at him as she rose her chin so he could kiss her neck and then whispered. "I'm pretty sure in my book that means fucking me."* - Fri Nov 13 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt her eyes close as she took in his kissing down her throat and her chest. "Sh-shark...r-right," panting lightly as he had a head start on her due to kissing her neck. Tingles went over her body but she was trying to play it cool. When he tried to pull down her panties she wasn't sure about this but he was very attractive... everything felt good... but she felt wrong about it. Her eyes opened wide and she peered up at him and jerked her hand down trying to grip his wrist of one of the hands trying to pull the lingerie down. "No, I don't give up so easily... not for this, even if I enjoy what you are doing."* - Fri Nov 13 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) groaned lightly as she felt his hand against her cleft through the panties. As he reached up slowly and pinned her arm aggressively she breathed quickly and stared up with him with slight anger in her eyes. There was obvious lust still present but she didn't like that he was being forceful. Her hand that was held down formed into a fist and her body became tense for a moment as she tried to gather her thoughts. "Please, let go of my arm," her voice sounded weak for that single phrase even as she was enjoying what he was doing. Something about the aggressive nature had concerned her or reminded her of something.* - Fri Nov 13 17:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) swallowed hard as he released her arm to only rest his hand atop her own. The sensation he was giving her was certainly mixed, she was struggling with the thoughts and then her feelings of the current situation were screaming at her to give in. "I know, I know.... always free, always free..." She whispered out in breathy exhales. "I want it... just so fast, I hardly know you...yet... know you so well." She groaned in frustration and lust as her dark eyes tried to lock onto his own. Lips slightly parted as she closed her eyes for a moment and then nodded subtly.* - Fri Nov 13 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) arched her back as her toes curled and feet pointed out straight towards the river. As his lips found her neck again she laid her head to the side and gripped his hand tightly now with all the strength she had, which wasn't much for Ortho to deal with. "You won't talk about this? Just between you and me? Just... friends in public then? Nngn.... or m-my sensei to explain our missing...long hours?" She whined out gently as her hips rose off the ground, the way he was working her panties in between her lips was only serving to tease her more as his fingers became soaked in her juices. "Nothing more than sex and friendship, r-right?"* - Fri Nov 13 17:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was truly enjoying how he was using her panties as a way to tease her. It was a type of teasing men didn't do often because they were too eager to get inside of a girl but he was getting to her in all the right ways. As he started to nibble on her neck, Eri moaned out faintly and gasped. "Okay, Sensei," whispered out in lust as she tried to keep it together.* - Fri Nov 13 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) also shuddered heavily when he kissed just below her ear.* - Fri Nov 13 17:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) squirmed beneath him and panted heavier as he toyed with her. The licking and such was driving her up a wall as she tried to get ahold of herself. "Mngng... tease," spoke out in a hoarse voice as she tried to raise her head to kiss him.* - Fri Nov 13 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whined out a moan in pleasure as she squirmed from the circles around her clit. When he tugged at her panties she didn't protest and only continued to kiss him as she deepened the kiss and tried to taste him so that by the time she left here their breathes would be the same. Nostrils flared from her breathing rising in speed and she was struggling to resist taking control over the situation. Eri wasn't used to just laying back and allowing the other to go to work. * - Fri Nov 13 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt him shifting her leg up and it instantly sent tingles down her spine at the thought of one of her favorite positions. When he pressed forward though she nearly bit his tongue on accident and jerked back with a heavy gasp and a loud moan that echo'd across the river. Her free hand reached up behind his back and dug nails in as she held onto him and stared up to the man. The way his hips were grinding against her lightly and how he was teasing her with the heat and stiffness of his cock made her whine desperately.* - Fri Nov 13 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) muttered soft curses against his shoulder as he sucked at her neck and shuddered from that alone. Everything was making her feel amazing but that most of all clearly had her in a trance, and he was picking up on it clearly since he was becoming more and more active with her neck. As he kept up the circles and rubbing between the two sexes kept away from each other by his thin boxers she was nearly about to beg for him to give her more. "O-ortho, p-please..." whispering out in desperation.* - Fri Nov 13 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose her hips as soon as she felt the bare head against her pussy. With both of her legs up in the air and over his shoulders she was struggling to stop herself from pressing against him to get his cock to force in without his guidance. While he was messing with his boxers she was squirming and rubbing desperately.* - Fri Nov 13 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gasped and jerked her back up into a high arch as she squeezed his hand tightly enough that her knuckles went white. Her other hand was scratching down his back to his ass and trying to force his hips forward to push inside of her deeper. When he finally was all the way in and stayed there, Eri panted out as she squeezed down with her kegal muscle and trembled with pleasure as she let go of any control she had before.* - Fri Nov 13 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) got really into it, she was focused and trained on Ortho as he pleased her. She easily would cum several times for him and hopefully he was smart enough not to cum in her because that could end up bad for them. As long as he hadn't came in her she would lay there for several minutes after catching her breath before going down to the river to clean up and then coming back to put her clothes on. "Looking forward to our second session, Sensei." With a small bite of her lip she started to head back to the settlement.* - Fri Nov 13 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) thinks: Fucking dramatic ass. - Sat Nov 14 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was flicked and snarled at Ortho for a moment before she lifted off and began to float. "N-ngnng..." she pressed her thighs together and held her hands on the front and back of her skirt trying to keep it from showing any of her goodies.* - Sat Nov 14 02:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I haven't seem them before, but then again. I'm a rookie Genin. - Sat Nov 14 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was still holding her legs together but wasn't going to ask to be put down because she wouldn't be allowed to go down. She glanced over towards the people from Kirigakure, literally having no idea why they were here.* - Sat Nov 14 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: No. They're from elsehwere. Not sure where though. - Sat Nov 14 02:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: ...So. This is pretty awkward. - Sat Nov 14 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was lowered to the ground assumably and given gravity balance again. She glared at him with her hair very wind blown and straightened out her clothing before reaching up to her hair and running her hands through the mane.* - Sat Nov 14 02:41:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked around at the quaint village now serious again. She didn't really like how it looked and it wasn't in the Land of Fire, he knew how she would feel about this.* - Sat Nov 14 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: That was easy to tell by the guards. - Sat Nov 14 02:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) glanced over towards Mizumi and eyed him up and down before stepping back a bit since he wanted to speak with Ortho. She glanced over at Hatsu's guitar then and studied it for a short moment before looking back to Mizumi.* - Sat Nov 14 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why are all the men Ortho knows attractive, maybe he's hiding something. - Sat Nov 14 03:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) blinked once at how Ortho was being rude to Mizumi and then reached into her bag and pulled out one of her earbuds to her NinjaTunes player. Music started to play and a subtle rock beat sounded as she listened in on the conversation with one ear. She was interested in introducing herself for once to the older man but Ortho seemed on edge so she remained quiet with only a curious glance lingering on Mizumi.* - Sat Nov 14 03:12:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rolled her eyes and then put in her other earbud and turned up the music. Soon enough her head was bobbing slowly to the beat.* - Sat Nov 14 03:22:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) could see the issue going on and the fact that she could still hear Mizumi only because he was speaking slightly louder than the rest she popped one earbud out and stated in a casual voice, "it isn't made for scratching backs, you'd have better luck with a tree."* - Sat Nov 14 03:29:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded but then folded her brow lightly at his idiotic attempt at blinking. "Right..." a single brow rising as she was growing more and more disinterested by the mere fact he was a weirdo. "And a guitar plays music, all kinds of music," at this point she was only speaking up about it because she felt insulted he didn't know what a guitar was, it was the instrument of the gods obviously considering the classic rock she was listening to.* - Sat Nov 14 03:33:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Fire anything, but if that isn't your specialty there are always other areas that are needed to be trained in. - Sat Nov 14 08:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) had enjoyed the music rather well but she said nothing else to Hatsu since he had seemed upset. Eventually she peered up to Ortho who had been whispering back and forth with her over the last few minutes.* - Sat Nov 14 08:55:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Will you teach him or are you waiting to see if he is going to die out here? Not all shinobi are meant to be hardened, perhaps he is more of a supportive roll. - Sat Nov 14 09:05:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: How about we leave so both of you can cool off... and I can get some training in? - Sat Nov 14 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Let me rephrase it so it can't be used against me later. . . - Sat Nov 14 09:28:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded to Ortho as he glanced at her and then went to follow him to wherever he was leading her.* - Sat Nov 14 09:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: And I meant to the serpents, Sir. - Sat Nov 14 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was being the most respectful she had been since ...ever.* - Sat Nov 14 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..I can get used to that, ya'know. - Sat Nov 14 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmph.. - Sat Nov 14 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Anyways.. - Sat Nov 14 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you accept? - Sat Nov 14 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Me calling you Sir or knowing the answers to my own questions directed at you? - Sat Nov 14 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Both. - Sat Nov 14 09:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Yes, I do accept, Sir. - Sat Nov 14 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Sign it.. with your blood. - Sat Nov 14 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) reached out to take the scroll and then sat down on the ground. She took out a senbon and pricked her finger after the scroll had been spread out before her. She then wrote out her full name which would be the first that Ortho would see her first name. Funny that he trusted her so much yet didn't even know her true name. -Supaiku, Eri- was written out in Japanese hand and then she wiped her thumb on the grass and stared down at the blood darkening as it settled in. "Do I need to know the handseals to go there or will it activate upon my signature?"* - Sat Nov 14 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) watched intently and then nodded and lowered her head with one knee on the ground and the other bent at a ninety degree angle ready to be in an already respectful position when she would arrive. Forming the handseals and then using the blood already leaking from her index finger she smeared it across her opposite palm and then pressed her palm to the ground. A flash of a seal spread out around her and it should work to teleport her to the caves.* - Sat Nov 14 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was not a very weak willed person, as she arrived she listened and heard the rattling. Once it was established that the rattling was far off and not close she rose her head to see the light in the distance but didn't dare activate a light of her own, instead she activated her sharingan to see snakes so she wouldn't step on them, or possibly run into anything large in size. She didn't bother to take out a weapon and even as the feeling of dread came over her, the girl's hands remained steady and still with a gentle sway at her sides. She kept into a light crouch if only to avoid hitting her head and held her hand out in front of her. If she had spotted any chakra signatures ahead of her when she activated the sharingan then she would try to analyze them to determine if the serpents she saw were sleeping or awake.* - Sat Nov 14 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) did not hesitate to continue on past the other snakes. She looked to each of them with her red eyes she knew they could feel the chakra likely coming off of in the darkness but said nothing and did not stop. There wasn't a single one that she didn't look upon for a few seconds respectfully, she found it might be rude to ignore any of their presence. As she stepped into the room with light and the rattling continued to grow louder her heart was beating heavily and she could feel sweat across her skin due to the humidity of the caves from the snakes large bodies alone holding heat likely from the sun bathing in the late afternoon, wherever it was they were of course.

When the light went out she stopped walking and stood entirely still even as she saw the snakes tail coming for her and motioning to wrap about her legs to hold her in place. Listening very clearly to his words she lowered her head respectfully but kept the sharingan active with only the reasoning to keep full control over her emotions and to be able to see where the serpent's body was located. She could feel the scales across it's skin, and how it's muscles shifted in strength around her without actually squeezing tightly enough to harm her. When she heard his question she said nothing else than her name in a clear and audible enough tone to fill the room but no further. "Supaiku, Eri."* - Sat Nov 14 10:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't dare raise her head even if she could see his eyes and flicking tongue out of her pheriphereal vision. She inhaled and exhaled slowly before speaking, "I can assure you that I'm not lost. I was sent here to gain your favor, I may be young in years but I hope what sense I have proves valueable enough for you to share your wisdom."* - Sat Nov 14 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) blinked a bit at the light being revealed but after the snake had released her body she lowered her head further, "thank you." She didn't have anything else to say and after the snake had moved out of the path she would clearly walk towards the light without issue with a hand out in front of her to be wary of walls and her feet rising and then feeling out in front of her but not in a skidding fashion so that she would head towards the next light. If she saw any snakes like she did before she entered the room, she did the same before. Giving each of them the benefit of looking towards them with a short glance.* - Sat Nov 14 10:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) || As soon as she had stepped into the room she was shocked by his magnitude, she had yet to see Manda and this was a very large snake. Her will did falter for a moment but she regained it soon after and lowered her head respectfully. His question troubled her as she tried to determine the proper response to impress the ancient serpent. 

"Perhaps my words before were cryptic, I do not come to ask of any favors but to gain your companionship as favorship to those among yourself, Lord. As for what I have to offer, I am but a young warrior with determination to protect my family. What I can offer is not much but loyalty, though if there is something you find throughout your wisdom I can feel simply wafting off of you, then I would likely oblige to your wishes, I say likely, as I couldn't possibly agree to give something up that I might in turn deny you if I am unable or unwilling to give."* - Sat Nov 14 11:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) blinked and finally rose her head, "well if I knew I could talk as I normally do, this probably would have been easier. Thank you for your blessing, Lord." She bowed her head again to him but felt like Ortho's advice had actually been potentially harmful since she had been overtly kind when it wasn't necessary.* - Sat Nov 14 11:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) inhaled and exhaled slowly after the great sage had left. She then folded her hands into seals the other way around and was summoned back to her position in the Land of Fire beside Ortho. Likely this might shock him since she had been gone for not even close to the amount of time he was gone for.* - Sat Nov 14 11:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) glared up at him, "actually the Lord said that your fancy talk wasn't needed and I should have gone at it straight and blunt like I always speak."* - Sat Nov 14 11:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) frowned as she looked upon him with her red eyes and then let them fade away while motioning to sit beside him with legs tucked under her bottom. "I wasn't necessarily not myself, I just resisted certain comments. I -can- be polite you know, Sir."* - Sat Nov 14 11:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) blinked some, "then I certainly was exactly what they wanted."* - Sat Nov 14 11:51:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: If I wasn't already assuming, I would think that you used this as a test for yourself and not only for the serpents. - Sat Nov 14 11:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. Figure out the rest, my prodiy student. - Sat Nov 14 13:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) mocked him by mouthing the words silently and then bouncing her head back and forth with an ugly expression like a child. She formed the handseals and easily formed the chakra within her gut just under the lungs before it began to fill with heat and she held up her hand to channel the chakra in a circular motion to form the ball of flames and blew out with a large exhale as it appeared like a circus act when they spit fire. She was nearly, like he said, a prodigy at it, when really she was just a fast learner due to the amount of hours she put into studying fire formation. Not to mention the skill she knew already was far more complex than this one.* - Sat Nov 14 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Sat Nov 14 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: This jutsu is lame. - Sat Nov 14 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) watched calmly but was certain she wouldn't learn this as easily since she didn't know summoning techniques all that well. She flowed through the handseals with ease, that was always the easy part, and then allowed a bit of blood to rest on her finger as he said as she stuck her hand out and flowed chakra through the limb. She held her arm out for a while and nothing happened. "Erg..."* - Sat Nov 14 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) attempted again after lowering her arm. Squeezing her index finger so the blood continued to flow she then formed the handseals and shot her hand out trying to summon the snake and will them to attack for her. This time two snakes shot out and twisted before turning to smoke soon afterwards.* - Sat Nov 14 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) folded her hands into seals again but this time it was a failure once more. It seemed like this was a hit and miss sort of thing. She had to put enough chakra and blood to ease out the snakes but for now she was simply having to convince them that she was even good enough to come out for.* - Sat Nov 14 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) laid back on the grass and groaned before sitting back up and forcing herself to yet again form the handseals. She channeled the chakra up through her arm and then flung it forward and nothing shot out yet again. A scream sounded in outrage as she echo'd through the tree's and a few birds flew off. Eri was not used to failure... at least not many years.* - Sat Nov 14 16:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes, frustration high as she placed her hands together. Taking things much slower this time to see if perhaps she was messing up a step and that's what was tripping her up. She wished she had her NinjaTunes to help keep her calm but hey, it isn't a perfect world. When it didn't work another time she shook her head and then laid back on the grass, giving up for the moment at least.* - Sat Nov 14 16:06:49 2015
