<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh really huh? - Fri Dec  4 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Yup. - Fri Dec  4 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispered against his ear, "show me your worst."* - Fri Dec  4 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) hadn't expected him to act -that- quickly. When he forced her down she widened her eyes and jerked with her top arms restrained against the dirt and her face pressed down against the dirt with a grunt as she tried to reach back and punch him weakly in the ribs since her arm was at an awkward direction. Honestly things looks really inappropriate as she hadn't expected him to pin her this way, hell it wasn't even fair since she had expected a full out fight...not some cheating bullshit like this.-- She should have known, he was an archer after all who used poison. Dirty cheat.* - Fri Dec  4 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: Do I even want to know.... - Fri Dec  4 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: F-fuuuu - Fri Dec  4 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oi! You're cheating! - Fri Dec  4 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: ...... - Fri Dec  4 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: It seems it is....what the fuck are they doing? - Fri Dec  4 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) grit her teeth and moved her chin up so she could twist her neck to look back at him and squirmed as she felt the harsh impact of his knee to her lower back to force her back into a small arch and her second and third set of arms were trying to knock into his elbows with one set to knock him off balance while the other set kept trying to swing at his ribs. Her legs she couldn't do much with an so was pretty effectively pinned...he was using all of her strength tactics against her so it didn't matter if she was normally stronger than him.* - Fri Dec  4 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Just gave her an opening. - Fri Dec  4 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Take it.. - Fri Dec  4 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: They appear to be fighting. - Fri Dec  4 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt him shift his knee and his hands, <too easy...fucking fool>. She rose her hips quickly in a jerk up so it would force his knee up and off balance as one of her arms jerked forward to grip his wrist as he tried to take ahold of her hand and then pressed down harshly on the pressure point at his wrist to send a shooting and then numbing pain up his arm and into his hand's motor control. 

She then twisted under his body so that she was facing him and one of her fists aimed to strike directly at the center of his sternum with a second fist following quickly after and striking directly below the sternum trying to knock the wind out of him. Her strikes weren't strong but they were hella abusive to the matter of her knowing how bodies worked fairly well. She took advantage of several weak spots by trying to punch various soft spots and organs along his torso.* - Fri Dec  4 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) took in a deep breath as she rolled quickly away from him as soon as she saw him evade by rolling to the side. Kari rolled in the opposite direction and pulled herself up into a crouch while staring up at him from his position of staring down to her. The hood was off of her head and her hair was every which way from the struggle. It seemed whatever had been revealed had been covered again as she rose slightly and shifted in a half circle to the West in a semi circle to keep him moving as he tried to get feeling back in his arm, though it was only a short duration of numbness since she had only had her hand on the wrist for a few moments. "Why would I teach you? Then you'd have more things to take me down. I still have to figure out a way to deal with your stupid arrows."* - Fri Dec  4 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) stood up to fully height and jerked back quickly from him a bit more out of range as he pulled out one of the arrows. One might swear she was -scared- of it.* - Fri Dec  4 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: She cant go on much longer. - Fri Dec  4 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) was completely unaware of Akito in the background, she was FAR too paranoid about that arrow. She cringed as her lip quivered some and then she shook her head, "No... no round too.. I'm good, " trying to play off like she wasn't scared of the stupid ass poison.* - Fri Dec  4 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) stepped back mimicking his movements, "nah.... we chill."* - Fri Dec  4 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: in the anime - Fri Dec  4 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) grumbled out and then quickly formed chakra within her belly and spat out a long string of web towards the bow to try and grip it and toss it to the side. Immediately afterwards she set out a barrage of small webs from her mouth that were aimed at various parts of his body. The first two being at his feet to trap him against the ground, one at his face to cover his mouth and nose to stop him from having a way of breathing and would have to submit if he couldn't get it off, and then some at his hands in front of his body to try and force them to be attached to his body for a while before he could break out of them.---if he could break out of them at all.* - Fri Dec  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: ..... - Fri Dec  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: You dont see that every day. - Fri Dec  4 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) probably could have figured out a way to prevent her being cut with the poison arrow but seeing as she was running so low on chakra she barely could try and dive off to the side but in the end she was hit by the arrow and screamed out, "FUCK!" She knew it was over, she didn't even bother to try and get up only to fall again. Rolling over onto her back she groaned out as she felt the effects already coming into play and her body felt slow. Due to how tired she was already it hit her much harder this time than any of the times before and within a matter of moments she was laying there paralyzed.* - Fri Dec  4 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: ....... - Fri Dec  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: ..Hello... - Fri Dec  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) groaned as she was tossed over his shoulder and grumbling commenced as she cursed his cheating ass.* - Fri Dec  4 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: ...Someone watched me get my ass kicked? - Fri Dec  4 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAT. - Fri Dec  4 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah. So uh.. - Fri Dec  4 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: You didn't see this. - Fri Dec  4 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Okay?Okay. - Fri Dec  4 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: What the shit are you doing... - Fri Dec  4 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Give me the freaking antidote. - Fri Dec  4 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I never restocked on my antidote.. It's in my house.. - Fri Dec  4 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Sheesh.. - Fri Dec  4 06:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: So attractive. - Fri Dec  4 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) rolled her eyes and sighed heavily.* - Fri Dec  4 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Yes, kari. I -have- antidote. - Fri Dec  4 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) gasped out as he nearly knocked the breath out of her from how hard he dropped her on the bed. Her legs and arms spread out all over of course as she growled out and because of how he had left her the closed eye on her forehead was fully visible.* - Fri Dec  4 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .............. - Fri Dec  4 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt and heard him rip her fucking CUSTOM MADE OUTFIT AGAIN. She growled out at him doing such a thing and then spoke up as he walked away, she was getting tired of being stuck with needles. "You know I have to pay a lot for these outfits... I don't exactly have that much money." She grumbled and then sighed out and spoke again as he was walking away, "and is there like a different way for you to give me that? Ugh.. I'm getting tired of getting stuck with needles, I don't even like doctors and you get away with poking me with a freakin' needle every time I visit!" * - Fri Dec  4 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) sighed out as she saw the money out of the corner of her eye and she then closed her eyes and twitched her lips to the side. "You are sort of down aren't you? I'm having fun...and you are just... you're off." She also knew he could see her eye but hadn't said anything. She slowly sat up and tried to look like she was being smooth and smoothed her bangs in front of her eye and around her face but left her hood down.* - Fri Dec  4 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Can you answer me? - Fri Dec  4 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I'd like for you to answer me. - Fri Dec  4 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not 'down'.. - Fri Dec  4 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Just.. wish I could do better. - Fri Dec  4 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...but we were having fun... - Fri Dec  4 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) looked at him softly as she didn't understand why he was upset when she actually was having a -lot- of fun... What they just did was 'fun' for her.* - Fri Dec  4 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) looked at him with those same soft eyes and smiled gentler than she did towards anyone, in fact he was the only one that got this expression from her. "I told you that I was yours, even if we are far away from each other did you think I'd travel all this way to see you at least three times now for no reason? ---Oh.. you don't know where i've been, Sogeki..." She turned to face him more, "I've been all the way in -rain country-... do you see how far I come to see you? Granted this trip wasn't just for you but the othes when you were in the hospital were for you."* - Fri Dec  4 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her lip from inside and looked over to him as he nudged her and she reached out for his hand as it had come half way. She wrapped her fingers with his and then twitched her lips to the side, "maybe... one on the cheek..." She had muttered it out some with a small pout as she tried to give him a little something.* - Fri Dec  4 07:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt the anticipation building up as he leaned in and then he...denied -her- a kiss? When she WANTED it? Her eyes diverted away, "Oh.... Okay."* - Fri Dec  4 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Besides. - Fri Dec  4 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: You probably like it better with an arrow to your neck - Fri Dec  4 07:25:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt her chest actually -flutter- because of that stupid shit. She wrinkled her nose up in anger at her own emotions and stuck her tongue out. "Yeah right..."* - Fri Dec  4 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt him lean in quickly and give her the long kiss that made her cheeks burn hot with embarrassment and she felt the hint of sickness but for the most part she enjoyed it. It was a strange sickly sweet feeling as she smiled small and then wide after he had pulled away.* - Fri Dec  4 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) was trying to ignore him looking her up and down, she was used to it by now. She lowered her gaze down and then spoke up, "well uh... I don't know.. I sort of dropped everything and ran out here so quickly I didn't even let my brother know, I just asked some random guy to let him know." She shrugged some, "maybe I can stay a few days?" She smiled weakly and thought in silence for a moment, "Sogeki.. I know you saw my forehead, why are you pretending you didn't?"* - Fri Dec  4 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) rubbed her lips together at the  mention of the word freak. "I mean.. I -am- a freak... but I'm okay with the fact I'm a freak." She reached up and brushed her bangs to the side away from her face and then opened the third eye at the center of her forehead. It was just as red as her other two with a black slit for a puppil, perfectly identical.* - Fri Dec  4 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm comfortable with who I am, Sogeki... I'm just a little surprised you like me regardless of these.... loks. - Fri Dec  4 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: *looks. - Fri Dec  4 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her lip at him not freaking out about the eye when it opened, "Yeah... I'm really good at seeing when I use it... but I hardly ever have a reason to use it. If I had used it in our fight though... I wouldn't have missed the bow from that range. I wasn't wanting to use it in a play fight." she closed the ey again and let her bangs fall back over the eye.* - Fri Dec  4 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) blinked a bit, "zap me?" She shifted while still holding his hand strangely and leaned in against his shoulder with her own on the bed, her head coming to rest on the pillow beside him.* - Fri Dec  4 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) blinked a bit, "zap me?" She shifted while still holding his hand, strangely enough, and laid down so her head was on the pillow close to behind his hips and leaned in her shoulder against his thigh and hip as she stared up to him as he sat up on the bed. It was mostly likely adorable. * - Fri Dec  4 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes, "Oh...wow..." When she felt the electricity tingle over her arm and lift the peach hairs she widened her eyes and felt her heart race thinking he was really going to zap her. It looked like she was on edge but in an adrenaline filled junky kind of way... like when he poisons her.* - Fri Dec  4 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) watched his hand nervously wondering if he was going to hurt her or just tease her. "It feels powerful, why didn't you use it against me before?---Oohhh, I know. You like me awake when I lose...huh?"* - Fri Dec  4 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) bit down hard on her lip as he made her body begin to coat in gooseflesh out of reaction of the electricity conducting over her form in a controlled way. When he got to her thigh she shifted her hips some and exhaled out with a slow breath trying to keep herself calm since the adrenaline of if he might hurt her or not was keeping her on edge. "You think I'm too weak to take it?"* - Fri Dec  4 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: ----- - Fri Dec  4 08:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) inhaled sharply as he touched her thigh out of the assumption she was going to be shocked and even jumped some. When nothing happened she relaxed a bit, "you sure seem like you want to hurt me sometimes."* - Fri Dec  4 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: ..Well.. - Fri Dec  4 08:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) rose her brow, "what was that? you thought of something."* - Fri Dec  4 08:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) blinked a bit and looked away, "Shit... it's like I always bring something bad up..."* - Fri Dec  4 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) inhaled sharply at him squeezing her thigh.* - Fri Dec  4 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes as she felt where his hand was going and then she rolled over onto her back and stared up at the ceiling.* - Fri Dec  4 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: OCARE - Fri Dec  4 09:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: And all I did was turn over onto my back when I got uncomfortable. See? No harm done. - Fri Dec  4 09:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) sighed and sat up, "Oi. You are ruining the moment."* - Fri Dec  4 09:26:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ...that would ruin the moment.~ - Fri Dec  4 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: But... you know I think when you almost hurt me it sort of acts like how normal people get when they are nervous and want someone to touch them. I thought that was weird... it seems like the same feeling I've read about in books. - Fri Dec  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Does that seem right? - Fri Dec  4 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I wish I could feel that sensation when you were going to..do those things. - Fri Dec  4 09:47:56 2015
