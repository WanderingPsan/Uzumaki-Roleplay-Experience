<br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) didn't want to be cut by the paralytic....so she held absolutely still. She felt his lips press against her own and she groaned out as he stole her second kiss and she felt sick to her stomach. She held her belly with her hidden arms and she forced herself to endure the kiss but didn't kiss back as she hoped it would end soon.* - Sun Nov 29 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) was holding still and still not kissing him back as she felt his lips move against her own and he would be able to taste the cotton candy bubble gum flavor on her lips. When he shifted the arrow, apparently he had narrowly sliced her skin open enough along her breast that the poison began to soak into her skin. She was unaware of it since the cut was that similiar to a paper cut in all honesty. 

She started to feel unwell but that was normal after kissing someone. As he pressed into her some and began to kiss her deeper she felt her lips forced open and reached a hand up now to push on his hand gripping her and tried to pull him off weakly. <Why do I feel so weak? Am I losing it?> She pulled away from the kiss and swayed some as she thought she was just experiencing something new to this type of kissing.... it was certainly different than the kiss she had wiht Shiro.* - Sun Nov 29 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) wasn't aware she was poisoned just yet...but apparently he recognized her swaying. She felt her ankle roll and instinctively she caught herself as she fell with a different arm and groaned as she came to sit on the ground. "W-wha..." she shook her head back and closed he eyes. She was still able to move but it was extremly slow. "what is...agh..." she swayed as she sat on the ground and he told her to admit she was a loser and he was the king. Shaking he head, assuming this was just a bad sick spell. She tied to adust the hood of her clothing in the process.* - Sun Nov 29 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) suddenly passed out, her body slumping over onto the ground with a hard thud of her head against the ground, at least she had been sitting on the ground already. * - Sun Nov 29 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: ...Holy -shit- that hurt. - Sun Nov 29 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: When did he get me? - Sun Nov 29 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I didn't even feel it. - Sun Nov 29 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) groaned out as he pulled her slack body towards him. Now she couldnt' hide her multiple arms.... her body was slack, he easily would feel them and see some of them sticking out of her cloak as he pulled her to his lap (? i think?) and prepared a serum to break the effects of the poison...* - Sun Nov 29 08:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: And K-Kari just took it. . . .she didn't even get sick. . . - Sun Nov 29 08:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) ..assumes that Sogeki is holding her paralyzed body right now?* - Sun Nov 29 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) hated this, she was breathing as hard as the paralysis would allow. She was staring up at him with her eyes watering from hardly being able to blink as she glared at the man. As she sat on his lap and lay acoss his leg she hated it but somehow he had ignored her multiple arms... perhaps the drama was too much for him, she wasn't really thinking about that anyhow since she thought he already knew. When the serum was injected she gasped for air but still wasn't able to sit up just yet. "N-nongng..."* - Sun Nov 29 08:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Jeez, sometimes she's worse bi-polar thanme. - Sun Nov 29 09:00:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) lay entirely still, she knew if she lay there that the serum would work through her body faster. She closed her eyes now that she could and said nothing about the two bickering. She didn't move until she knew her body was read... for now that meant laying there for quite a while unless they were going to force her up.* - Sun Nov 29 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: Of course shit happens when I finally decide. - Sun Nov 29 09:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) slowly began to wiggle her fingers and feet, rotating at the wrists and then ankles. She did this with all her limbs and since Sogeki was watching her so intenly with her on his lap, he would be able to see a dark shadow upon her forehead for a moment before her hair had brushed over it again. Akarui would not have seen this.* - Sun Nov 29 09:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: Maybe I just shouldn't worry about other people, or being with them. - Sun Nov 29 09:15:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) tried to roll away from him then trying to force herself onto all floors. She stumbled a few times here and there as she climbed up to a stand and wobbed back and forth.* - Sun Nov 29 09:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) was waving two of her arms from one side of her body towards Sogeki while stumbling back a bit unstable.* - Sun Nov 29 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) froze as Akarui approached again. "Why ae you -here-? You get your heart broken and you keep coming back for more pain?! Are you addicted to the emotional wreck that you are creating? You can't stand to not see everything you are doing? He DOESN'T WANT YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE." She felt her rage growing as her switch came on and tossed her ove the edge. "And you betrayed my trust as a friend, no friend turns so quickly just from me leaving for a WEEK! You would have laid your life down for me and now it took you at least ten minutes to even realize I was drugged! What sort of person are you?!" She was screaming out by now with all six of her arms making hand gestures at the girl as the cloak had flown back. 

"I've had it up to here with all the stupid emotions and issues going on in other's people's mind that interupt my own fucking life! So spit it out already! You are here for something! WHAT IS IT?!"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) gripped her sides of head with one set of hands as the second and third clenched fists. "You hurt me DAMN IT! YOU WERE SUPPOSE TO BE THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY CARED AND SAW ME THE SAME BUT CLEARLY YOU DON'T. Or maybe that was the problem... you saw a plain girl who wasn't in the village and so you moved on but wanted to tug me along to keep me around JUST IN CASE something went sour with this FUCKER!" She snarled and paced back and forth as she clasped a hand over the opposite fists and growled. "I just don't get how you can be so HEARTLESS, like you expected ME TO BE HEARTLESS?! DID YOU THINK I WAS HEARTLESS AND THAT IT WOULDN'T MATTER? THAT I WAS A PLAY THING? IM NO ONE'S PLAY THING!"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) || By the time he had sat down next to her and looked over at her, the normal placid expression had returned, her eyes looked sharp and aware, and her breathing had settled. It was -way- too fast for normal. She sat there with her lower set of arms back behind her supporting her, second set resting on her knee's with lower ams and fingers hanging out loose, and her upper set was rubbing along the side of her neck and shoudlers befeore checking where she had gotten cut by the arrow. It was hardly noticable and didn't hurt. "Do you really believe what you just said? I think it ony phased her to leave for the moment."* - Sun Nov 29 10:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) shrugged, "Maybe...but from what I have seen she acts out of emotion....far too much, acting on emotion should be reserved for special occasions as a shinobi... or anyone that is going to survive in the shinobi world." She shook her head and sighed out heavily as her head lowered some with hood covering most of her face excluding the tip of her nose. "I thought she really was my friend... I looked forward to seeing her again, but as soon as I saw her at the lake with you I know something was going to be different."* - Sun Nov 29 10:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her bottom lip and then her hands that were dangling near each other at her knee's folded into rapid handseals. A sudden burst of tiny spider webs shot out with speed towards his hands and then feet. The web instantly hardened into the strength of steel.

At the very same time but only a few seconds delayed her upper most hands that had been rubbing at her neck formed seals at the same time with the second set. Making it so that the jutsu of the upper set of hands was performed a few seconds after the first was executed. Her cheeks bulbed after all the small webs had been spit out and then a giant web spit out to cover his entire body... also being the strength of steel. She rose from the ground and hovered over him and crouched above his chest staring down at him without actually touching him in the wrapped webs. "You're mine now," her tone very placid and possessive.

Course that's if she was successful.~* - Sun Nov 29 11:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I need to do more chakra training. - Sun Nov 29 11:18:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: normal arrow" - Sun Nov 29 11:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) was fairly confident he couldn't quick draw fast enough to hurt her badly or even grab her to stop her attacks. She was... sort of right, his sloppy attack had managed to slash through the side of her hoodie sleeve on her middle right arm and she hissed gently but had continued through with the attack knowing that i she didn't use up the chakra molded it would soon be a waste. She wasn't sure if she got hit with a normal arrow or not yet. She looked at her arm after he was caught to try and see if there was something laced in the wound that was coloed at all or a different texture than blood. "Shi---" she cutt off and felt the dizzy spell nealy on cue. "N-no... but..ngngn.. I won... I trapped you...f-fuu..." She shook her head trying to clear it and tried to stand up only to fall to her hands and knee's. Her physical resistance to the poison wasn't all that great but she was struggling to keep to it. "If I ... release you...will you give me the antidote?" She looked helpless as she looked over to him through he dark and red stands of hair. She didn't want to feel this defenseless again....* - Sun Nov 29 11:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) placed one hand on the webs and started to morph them with her fingers forming crazy movemenst that began to unbind him from the confines but she fell to the ground and could hardly move her hand anymore. "I... I can't... anymore..gngn---" her voice cut out as her head lowered down and she was left face down with her one hand extended out towards the spider webs. By this point he could easily beak out of them due to his raw strength surpassing their power.* - Sun Nov 29 11:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) groaned out a she lay with her face being smashed down against the salty smelling docks. "N-no... jus... I let you go... let me go..." she was worried and if she had been capable there was a tremble coming from her body but most notably was gooseflesh over parts of her exposed skin.* - Sun Nov 29 11:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Is this.....safe....so close together? - Sun Nov 29 11:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) shifted her head to the side so she could look at him, lots of other details about how she is watching him and then says something along the lines that she is going to be free soon and when she is he better hope he's far away from her.* - Sun Nov 29 12:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) squirmed and felt him pulling her pants down, she shouted out at him, "what are you doing?! You said you were freeing me! Get your nasty han--" She cut off as the kiss landed on her neck and she growled a snarl out at him as she tried to roll over with her pants half way down her ass cheeks and quickly she sent three punches out towards the area just below his chest to try and knock the air out of him. Bop, bop, bop. It was fast as all three fists struck one after the other trying to knock the wind out of him, that it was going to hurt like a bitch if it landed. "I'm not facing -shit-! She screamed out as she fought him back, maybe he should have left her to wear off the durnks, eh? * - Sun Nov 29 12:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) began to grow irritated with his actions. She was upset and alarmed before but now he was pushing things how he was trying to block her attacks while holding his lower chest and then ripped down her pants the rest of the way to expose her pale bare bottom. She trembled in fear and it was seein in her eyes as she tried to get out of his gip. The wrist that was grapped was looked at and then led up to Sogeki. "How about giving you fear... rather than taking mine." She screamed out and fought against him as several more flying punches aimed at vital points of his upper body muscles to try and stun or disable him for a moment. She attacked with every fist but the writst he held onto. She felt herself jerked forward and grip her teeth at being drug along hte ground so quickly. "Nngng... f-fuuck..." She reconized the bathroom of a lot of hopsital's she knew. "Experiencing it is only going to give me fear. Everyone has fear! I have fear, your father has deceived me, where as the true god shows you th elight towards the right path. It was obvious by her brow like and eyes she was tiring out, she was running out of energy ut perhaps she could help them enough that she didn't break Wynn's code when he tried to use * - Sun Nov 29 12:44:09 2015

"Nngng... f-fuuck..." she felt her belly and sex on the front scrape against the boards as she looked up to him helplessly and couldn't keep control over her show of emotion, she was -terrified- of what he was going to do to her. The anger had risen and it was evident by the screaming that she was growing more and more frustated. She gripped onto his arm that was holding her wrist and pulled forward so her upper body shifted closer and then her extremely sharp canines tried to dig into his arm. This was going to DEFINETLY cause pain and blood as it would make two puncture marks, and a row of other teeth marks from the rest of her teeth, lucky for him she couldn't poison him.~* - Sun Nov 29 12:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) laughed out in a crazed tone and look in her eyes as she tasted the iron liquid dripping off her 'fangs'. She was flipped over easily enough but she was bucking the entire time and when he tried to pull his cock out? Well to bad fo him... she has six arms and two feet and he has two arms that are pretty much the only thing he is using against her. She immediately tried to kick STRAIGHT BACK into his dick. She had no issue doing this to a man since she despised sex and she wasn't about to be raped and her viriginty stolen because he wants her to 'accept her fear'. 

She screamed out again and then tried to think of something to do that didn't involve chakra, if she used anymore she was going to pass out and then he would just get whatever he wanted regardless of fight. So soon after the kick to his groin had been executed she immediately quickly drew it back again and tried to kick up high behind her towards his jaw to kick in an upwards strike. Of course she was seeing all of this upside down but hey...she's a spider bitch? One of her hands reached up to the hand holding down her back and gripped the wrist at a pressure point in his wrist and squeezed as hard as she could so that it would send a shooting pain up his arm and then numb it for a few moments. At the same time another hand quickly aimed to strike at the back of his elbow to bend his arm wrong that was holding down one of her wrists to the dog. She was going for an all out hitter combo all at once. Deal with that, archery bitch.* - Sun Nov 29 13:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) quickly twisted over onto her back and shifted her weight up and onto her feet into a crouch as she glared at him for only a half second before lunching towards the quill and making it so her body easily curved around the back of his as she pulled out several different arrows out of his quill, if she found one that was purple, assuming she did she instantly was back around to his other side on the front from her quick moving. 

________


Without hesitation she aimed to slash with the arrow at his arm, if she missed? She slashed again and again until she managed to land a small cut and then tossed the arrow far away. Her body lunching onto his even with her pants gone entirely since she had been kicking and shifting so much earlier, they lay somewhere on the docks, Gezo knows where. Kari immediately started to pound punching hits towards his jaw and cheek bone. Trying to literally beat him into submission until the poison would kick in. She wasn't trying to kill him, she was trying to teach him a lesson.* - Sun Nov 29 13:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) had held back her hits to his jaw and cheekbones.... also the amount of poison put into his system because she wanted him to be able to talk but not move too much. She was panting heavily by the time she stood up off of his chest and walked over to her pants and pulled them on. There were rips in several places but at least her sex was covered up. She popped her neck to one side and then the other. She took up one of her daggers that had fallen out of her gear from the declothing and walked over to crouch just above Sogeki's head and crouch down and began to run the kunai down his neck and his chest as her bright red and black slitted eyes stared into his own. She spoke in a cruel whisper, "you will listen to me, because if you don't it will be your downfall, you failure beyond the failure you have already beheld...not only that but the failure of your liife living past today." 

She made sure she had his attention before continuing. All the while the kunai was pressing tightly but moving slow over his skin to do exactly what he did with the arrow head to her chest earlier in the night.* - Sun Nov 29 14:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) kept up her strokes of the kunai up and down his chest and neck. She even bought it up to his bottom lip and made it drag his bottom lip down to reveal his bottom teeth before releasing it again. "Good.... what you did was very bad... You know this, but you -wanted- to do it. I could tell, so I'm not going to report you to the village but I will tell you this."

Licking over her lips she lowered her head and whispered against his ear. "I will get another one of those poison arrows.... make sue you are nice and still and then drop you into the lake. Can you imagine how that much feel? Drowning and not being able to even try to help yourself?" She groand happily, "I will give you another chance to be in contact with m when I release you but you will not do anything like this again. If you do? I will assure your death in the worst kind of ways." She ran the kunai up so that it was nealy at the corner of her eye and then along his eyebrow and back down over his neck and chest. "Are we understood?"* - Sun Nov 29 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thought of something else and shifted to the male's other ear and whispered so that her breath was brushing against his eardrumb and outer ear. "Be afaid of me, Sogeki-san, be very afraid. You -are- afraid."* - Sun Nov 29 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) luckily had good control over the weapon in her hand and because he was slowed due to the paralytic he couldn't react all that fast to slit hist throat but he did manage to cut it some. "Mother fucker, what are you doing? Trying to get me executed?" She ripped off part of her pants and pressed it against the side of his throat to hold it there. She was calming down from her anger now and was placid in expression once more. She could see that fear in his eyes and it made her feel good, it meant that he wasn't going to try something like this for a very long time. Going through his gear she found his supplise for the anti-serum and held some of it up. "If I have the right one, close your eyes for two seconds and then reopen. You walk me through the steps this way and I will get you back to speaking and moving so you can go to the hospital."* - Sun Nov 29 14:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) didn't.... know what to do. She had never broken anyone before, she then remembered something and sat the gear down and hooked one set of arms under his armpits, one hand kept his neck stable and holding the compress against his bleeding neck, and the third guided his hips up so that he was leaning against her with her petite legs on either side of his body and she wrapped him into a hug with her chin on his shoulder. All her arms and legs wrapped abou this body to hold him tight except for the ones keeping his neck from bleeding further. "Shh...."* - Sun Nov 29 14:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I swear if he tells anyone about this.... - Sun Nov 29 14:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I'll hand him the kunai myself for him to slit his throat. - Sun Nov 29 14:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) moved the cloth away soaked in blood and could tell she needed to take him to a hospital now before he passed out. She hoised him up and held her in her six arms evenly distributed with his gear tossed over her shoulder so it was along with him when he was fixed up. She had gathered everything up and was still holding his neck to keep the bleeding down as she began the slow... long..and heavy walks to the hospital. This was all due to how heavy and large he was compared to her. It was obvious she was going to be sore later because of this trip alone.* - Sun Nov 29 14:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) took him to the hospital and handed him off to the ER. They did their thing to fix him up and likely tried to figure out his serum to make it so that he was able to move again. kari also informed the doctors that he might need a psych eval and a three day observation for sucide watch.* - Sun Nov 29 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) wasn't allowed in the room until all of the tests had been done. She slowly knocked and then stepped inside with her clothing still torn up. Walking over towards the bed and pulling a chair up without having to drag it across the chile flowering in the hospital. She sat down and sighed out heavily, "I just keep getting myself in weird situations...."* - Sun Nov 29 15:10:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Those I even went through the effort to convince I wasn't a traitor when I could have just taken their judgement. - Sun Nov 29 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: But think of how I could serve you. - Sun Nov 29 23:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I -never- thought you would agree to that. - Sun Nov 29 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Is this...really what you want to decide or do you just not like listening to me debate? - Sun Nov 29 23:24:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) watched him start to simply do fuuinjutsu and she twitched her lips to the side in a purse. She stepped forward and cautiously reached out towards Eiyu's hand and wrist to rest there. He knew here fairly well so far so he likely knew her disgust for touching other people if at all possible. "Raikage-sama... please... is this your decision because you want my aid in that way... or do you just tire of me debating?"* - Sun Nov 29 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) pulled he hand back as he regeted her, it hurt... quite a lot actually. She had to look away and try and blink a few times to stop from tears falling. "Raikage-sama... I know you hear from your shinobi every say how much they appreciate and are greatful for you ... but you are one of the three people I care about in this village deeply. I don't want you to be upset with me... but you wish to allow me to do what I want. I wish I could understand why.... why you won't answer me. Pehaps you always felt I was a burden even as you speak of me in such an endearing way." She paused and sighed out.

"Do you wish for me to be labeled a traitor then? Or will I be permitted to enter this village when i'd like?"* - Sun Nov 29 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) bit down hard on her lip and stared into his eyes, seaching own set with her red hues. "A-am I still your shinobi?"* - Mon Nov 30 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 30 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I'm probably pushing it...but...I do care. - Mon Nov 30 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) bit down hard on her lip, "and you do want me to work for you... to gather intel while I am away---WHEN I am away?"* - Mon Nov 30 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Man.. - Mon Nov 30 00:05:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) was literally about to ask this guy if she could HUG HIM, BUT THEN GUESS WHO WALKED IN?* - Mon Nov 30 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: ...What? - Mon Nov 30 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Mushrooms. - Mon Nov 30 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: ...That was a terrible joke... - Mon Nov 30 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hmm. - Mon Nov 30 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Though. - Mon Nov 30 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe, you're just lacking in the quality humor department? - Mon Nov 30 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Did you want to speak business? If so give me a second to finish up speaking to this woman- Oh, that's possible as well. - Mon Nov 30 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Right..I'll just wait. - Mon Nov 30 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) whispers: You are free. - Mon Nov 30 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Can... - Mon Nov 30 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I give you a hug? - Mon Nov 30 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) lowered her head as her cheeks turned bright red.* - Mon Nov 30 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) whispers: I trust in you, Kariduo. - Mon Nov 30 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) whispers: Do not... Forsake us. - Mon Nov 30 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: With all this death. I wonder if Kumogakure will be hit... - Mon Nov 30 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) wrapped her many arps around the kage from across the desk. She held him tight with her eyes closing and seemed as if she was perfectly content with the hug which was -vastly- out of the ordinary for her. She sighed out heavily and whispered back to him as he spoke her name. When her words were finished, Kari broke away from the hug if he allowed it, it was only held for enough time for her emotions to pas and show him how much she cared.* - Mon Nov 30 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I trust you, Raikage-sama. I will always be your shinobi, and will die with honor for my country. - Mon Nov 30 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) whispers: Do not speak of dying, my dear.. - Mon Nov 30 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: So many laughs..so little time. - Mon Nov 30 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) gave one last look to the kage before heading out of the mansion. "Thank you for your time, Raikage-sama."* - Mon Nov 30 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: No, thank you, Kari-Chan. - Mon Nov 30 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: Be safe. - Mon Nov 30 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: I never got to tap her booty lowkey either. - Mon Nov 30 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I wonder if those rumors about Eiyu being gay are true. - Mon Nov 30 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) came back to the hospital with a box of hot food from a local cheap ramen shop.* - Mon Nov 30 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) (*Engi, Kariudo came back to the hospital with a box of hot food from a local cheap ramen shop.*)* - Mon Nov 30 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) nodded and walked towards the bed and sat on the edge as she started to open the containers for him and sat them out for him to take. "Well, bringing you food and come to say goodbye temporarily, I got a new assignment for my position as a shinobi... My new job will keep me away from the village a lot of the time...but when I do visit I expect to see one of my closest friends even if he does things he regrets sometimes." She smiled gently and rubbed her lips together before pulling out a japanese soda and cracking the top to drink from. 

"I am going to be gone a long time for the first part probably.... it's gonna suck not seeing you."* - Mon Nov 30 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) watched him getting closer but figued it was for the food. When he looked so seriously into her eyes she froze and looked deep into his own with her red and black slitted hues. When she heard his tone.... it made gooseflesh slowly crawl up her spine and to the back of her neck before spreading out over the rest of her body. She inhaled slow and deep as she tried to keep control. <Babe....> echoed in her mind as she watched him take -her- soda. She watched his lips drink from the can and then hand it back to her. She stared down at the little bit of carbonated soda and his saliva on the edge of the can. She could see the light imprint of where his lips had been for a few moments while he drank. Swallowing hard she continued to stare down at it as if she was having a stand off at noon with a rebelious cowboy. * - Mon Nov 30 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) sighed out at how he was flirting, "why do you want me?"* - Mon Nov 30 01:54:20 2015
