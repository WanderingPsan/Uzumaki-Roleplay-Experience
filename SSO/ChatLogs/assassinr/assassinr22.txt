<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) gave him a look like 'you better'. It was cocky as hell and she was craving a piece of gum. She didn't know what else to say and just stared up at him for a while with shallow breaths as the scent of raspberry from her perfume likely became very evident to Sogeki from how close they had been together for an extended period of time. It was so light that he had to be this close to smell it and linger to understand the scent, she only used the body spray on her body so that it didn't spread in the air around her.* - Fri Dec  4 11:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) had to turn away as she felt herself getting more and more excited by the thought of the danger of just another prick. She couldn't say anything anymore without getting herself into trouble.* - Fri Dec  4 12:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) groaned out again and shook her head, not wanting to admit she wanted it.* - Fri Dec  4 12:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) panted out gently and squirmed beneath him as she pressed her thick thighs against each other and tried to keep control over how she was feeling. "W-what would you do?"* - Fri Dec  4 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) bit down hard on her lip as she heard what he said and how he teased with his hand. "W-what... you'd do what?" Her voice sounded desperate but a little worried about his intentions.* - Fri Dec  4 12:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) hitched her breath and rose her chin a bit a she tried to hold it together. "W-what if I don't want something to h-happen?"* - Fri Dec  4 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) jerked a bit as he gripped her breast and she shook her head trying to sit up. "N-no no... okay..that's enough... S-sogeki." She swallowed hard and was trying to sit up against the headboard to get some air from being under his body. When he touched her breast it was enough to bring her back. * - Fri Dec  4 12:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Just.... - Fri Dec  4 12:59:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) sighed out as she tried to touch her cheeks with two hands to cool off, her face was very red from how heated she had gotten.* - Fri Dec  4 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt herself pulled back down and she bit down on her lip before sucking it in and staring up at him nervously. As her head was nudged off to the side and his words brushed against her ear she trembled lightly with gooseflesh spreading over her body. As his lips brushed against her earlobe with each word hanging on his movements she panted heavier and heavier. He was getting to her easily now... it was obvious he found a pressure point to toy with and as he continued to kiss he ear an brush over the cartilidge she couldn't hold back a tiny whining moan half way through his statement. 

As his tongue and lips inhaled her earlobe she arched her back up and wrapped her arms around his sides and back to hold on as her head leaned back and she moaned out in a raspy growl of pleasure. "O-okay... t-the poison..." she didn't have her right mind to think about saying no right now. She just wanted more of what he was doing to her ear....* - Fri Dec  4 13:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) squirmed more and felt her arms laying out and gripping the sheets below her with her highest arms pressing up against the headboards for balance as she tried to stay still best she could as he assulted her ear with his tongue. It had her twitchy all over. 

staring up towards him she felt the prick and only thought to herself <No going back.. he's in charge now... fuck what am I doing.> She looked worried despite how he was arousing her. "J-just not too far?" She said it in a rhetorical tone before closing her eyes once again and sucking her lips in to lick over with anticipation as she already felt the drugs going through her blood stream. Groaning out she shifted under him barely able to hold still both from nerves and what he was doign to her ear.* - Fri Dec  4 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt a tingling in the bit of her stomach and knots from how he was treating her. As he rolled her over on her side and pressed up behind her she could feel the closeness and it caused her great alarm but she couldn't move. <Oh no, it's happened...that felt so fast... was it that fast before?> Everything felt sped up right now and that's when she felt his tongue and lips on her ear and then the hand cupping her petite breast. 

She shuddered but even still her arm went slack and by how he was having to hold her body against him it was obvious that she was out of control now by how her head lulled against the pillow and her breathing was audible from how it brushed over the pillow's surface. "Nngng..." she felt scared, violated, sick to her stomach, and excited all at once. How he was touching her made her feel like she needed to stop him but she knew that she couldn't. Her body twitched and she grunted out a tiny growl as she tried to take control over her body again, clearly it was frustrating her.* - Fri Dec  4 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) widened her slitted eyes as he tugged at her waistband to reveal her pale toned and wide hips. Her plain black cotton panties on display stretched tightly across her plump ass and hips as she tried to not shudder from what he was doing. She twitched again as she tried to move but couldn't and sighed out heavily feeling exposed to him. 

While he was kissing over her neck and ears he ended up kissing directly behind her ear on the soft tissue along her base of skull and neck. A giant wave of pleasure cascaded over her in tingles and she gasped out in reaction unable to control heself. Her breathing had picked up and by now her nipples were hard within the confines of her clothing and she was beginning to understand the purpose of allowing others to touch you if they could do -this- to you... unable to control yourself or not.* - Fri Dec  4 13:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) inhaled sharply in alarm as she felt him toying with her panties. She jerked some in another twitch but wasn't able to get hardly even an inch of movement as he parted her cheeks and forced his length between her pantie covered ass which began to stretch the fabric with each grinding movement. She could feel how hot his dick was and how it was hard and yet soft at the same time... nearly as hard as bone but not quite the same... She let out a shakey breath and held back any words in fear or ruining the moment but being worried about his movements. As the ear assault continued she was tortured and forced to remain aroused by it but now all of her attentionw as focused on her ass cheeks being wrapped fairly tightly around his length of cock. After all her cheeks were rather big so it wasn't hard to completely wrap about his length. <What is he trying to do?>* - Fri Dec  4 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt her panties pulled down and a little panic attack developed in her mind. She gasped lightly and whispered out in a weak whiny voice, "S-sogeki..." Her eyes rolled back and she felt her hot and...now very soaked cheeks with juices from her sex, he'd have his length thoroughly coated as he drove back and forth between her cheeks. With each stroke he came closer to her extremely tight virgin slit that likely couldn't take him at all, he was huge and she was extremely young and entirely inexperienced. Regardless she couldn't do anything about how close he was to pushing into her.... 

Panting out now as her moaning grew into a crescendo and Kari found it difficult to even focus by the time his hand was running up her belly towards her bra and pulling the cup down to reveal her nipple to his fingers yet still under her sweater. As he began to pull and twist her hardened nub she moaned out and shuddered heavily against him in her lax state with heavy pants against the pillow. Regardless of how slow he was going...everything felt fast to her, making he overwhelmed but not wanting to make him stop because it felt amazing... this is -exactly- her worst fear. He was making her worst fear become real.* - Fri Dec  4 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: cuz i didnt know if he could read the screen or not - Fri Dec  4 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) || Had been enjoying everything pretty well but when he tried to force into her she felt not only an immense pleasure but TERRIBLE pain. She screamed out and moaned into the pillow with heavy pants as her body shook from shock. Even if it was just the tip it was enough to break her hymen an cause a stinging to begin and a hiss from her tongue against her teeth. "Nngnng... S-sogeki?!" She sceamed out in both lust and terror as she could tell how much it felt good mixed with the pain. It was like she was going to die and be reborn all at the same time.

In all fairness, Kari was pretty dramatic. As her hymen was stretched and the small amount of blood coated his cock and mingled with her juices it was obvious what was the stronger feeling within her inner walls at the moment. "Nngng...p-please..." she didn't know why she was begging, she didn't know if she was suppose to stop him or encourage him to continue. For now, Kari was so innocent and unable to control herself due to feeling these sensations for the first time that she was sort of a lost puppy.... and he was having his way with her.* - Fri Dec  4 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) 's chest rumbled with pleasure as she trembled against him weakly, entirely under his control with only her words and moans to manipulate the situation. She never actually tried to manipulate him... funny how that worked out. When he asked he to speak and wanted a yes or no she rolled her eyes back feeling a wave of pleasure come over her along with accompanied anxiety. "Y-yes... y-yes p-please.. I... I-i'm scared... s-so scared...Y-yes." Even as she told him how terrified she was, she clearly wanted him deeper inside of her.* - Fri Dec  4 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt a little drool coming from the corner of her lip but was having trouble controlling her face by now. As he pushed into her and held her closer her trembling only increased with tension as she felt him stretching her inner walls. With each stroke given, Kari let out a semi pleasured but mostly painful sound. "S-sokeki..nngng... h-hurts... good... ngnng." she felt her eyes roll back some as a climax was building on it's own but she wasn't aware of how to tell and so she was left to moaning out helplessly, he really was being awfully nice for her being entirely paralyzed for his pleasure* - Fri Dec  4 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) was far too gone to even focus on the fact she was feeling pain and illness in her belly. Her mind was clouded by her emotions and lust as he fucked her defensless body with her pussy dripping enough by now for a squelching sound as  he slid in and out of her cunt between her closed thighs making it all that much tighter. She was certainly going to be sore tomorrow but all it took was two strokes over her g-spot with the head of his cock and her body's muscles tensed instinctively and a loud moan sounded as she pantied heavier than ever. Her pussy wasn't able to clench both because of the poison and the lack of experience with sex. As the orgasm cycled through her body she had a thin film of sweat over her exposed body parts, everything to do with between them was likely thoroughly marked by their sex... Kari had given in entirely... and finally was relaxing simply from the forced orgasm.* - Fri Dec  4 15:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) lay still and panting as the only movement from her body was her thighs and ass as he worked them back and forth against his climaxing dick. She could feel the sticky warmth over her ass crack, pucker, and cheeks and it made her sick for a moment but she resisted puking pretty well, luckily for her he wasn't focused on her face and her face probably couldn't make much of an expression other than her eyes anyway. As he finished off and looked down at his creation, the half undressed girl lay with all her arms every which way laid out in front of her, likely out of the way of her breasts since he had been feeling them up an her cheeks were bright red  with blush from her climax. 

Adding onto the image further her ass cheeks were red from the slapping against her fair skin and she was coated not only in his cum along her backside and between her cheeks but she also had her own cum and a little bit of pink blood mixed in with the juices between her thighs all the way down practically to the knee and dripping along her hip and lower belly at the front from how he had been fucking her raw.* - Fri Dec  4 16:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Everything feels tingly... and awful in some ways... what was that... it was amazing... why did I like that? - Fri Dec  4 16:06:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) of course was still helpless to his wants as he toyed with her ass and squished her cheeks about making light sounds of the cum snapping little strands between right and left ass cheek. As he shifted up and wrapped his arms around her she was leaned back in against him with the cum probably getting on more of his crotch that was not already messy and soaked with their cum. She said nothing but a small noise, "M-mhm..."* - Fri Dec  4 16:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes a bit as he started to touch her again and then she whispered out hesitantly, "There's...more?" As his cock's side and the cum slid and rubbed against her tight pucker her cheeks began to turn red again as ebmarrassment settled in and she knew that this couldn't be normal right? But he was enjoying.... maybe it was normal. Swallowing hard she realized that it was beginning to feel sort of nice again even if she didn't like how wet she felt.* - Fri Dec  4 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) gasped out at how his fingerse found her crevice and she felt his cock barely stroking against he cheeks and the bottom lips of her wet sex and thighs. As his fingers brushed over her pucker she twitched slightly and a chill went noticably up her spine. "W-what are you doing? It feels different..." She huffed lightly in lustful want even if she was frightened of him causing her to lose control again. "W-why are you touching me -there-? That's suppose to happen?" She was embarrassed at all he was toying with her pucker... to her that wasn't a sexual location even if he was making it sure as hell feel like one.* - Fri Dec  4 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes in alarm at his words as he threatened to enter her with his fingers. As he kissed her ears she flushed a deep red and gooseflesh traveled down her arms and back with nipples intantly hardening beneath her sweater. "H-how soon? I don't th-think I can handle anymore, Sogeki," she sounded fearful, alarmed...and also wishing and lustful.* - Fri Dec  4 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt worried by what he said and a she was rolled over onto her belly she still couldn't see. Soon enough though she felt his tongue on her back and she inhaled lightly with a gasp of surprise as his tongue trailed down her back and then towards her crack. When he spread her cheeks she hesitantly shook, "U-uuuuuuuuhh, S-sogeki? H-hah...f-funny joke..." She was growing very nervous and his next words didn't help. She swallowed hard but couldn't move. "W-why don't we just.. g-go get a shower? You know...antidote...and.. stuff..?"* - Fri Dec  4 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) grit her teeth and gasped out as he licked over her puckerand shifted some of the cum along her crack. As he spoke again she whimpered out desperately and then felt him kissing and licking again making her shudder without being able to control it. This was a new type of violation and the thought of him licking there or her cum was making her sick to the stomach but at least he wasn't expecting -her- to do something like this. She moaned out gently and felther body react by heating up once more, he was obviously getting the reaction he wanted without her being about to stop it or even fight back. The teasing of course was providing her no form of release... he was torturing the poor girl.* - Fri Dec  4 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) felt the sting of his slap on her ass and she wanted to tense her ass cheek but couldn't. She wasn't thinking about saying no... she didn't want to ruin things and what he was doing was pleasantly strange even with all the fluids on her body and him licking them up. "W-why are you doing that? I d-don't understand why... ngng.. d-doesn't that taste gross?" She was confused since to her it HAD to taste nasty, right? She shuddered again as he continued to lick her pucker and when he went low enough to lick her pussy she widened her eyes and moaned out in excited surprise.* - Sat Dec  5 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) gasped out and he easily had heated her up again, she went silent as he was assualting her behind and she refused to speak anymore since he wouldn't answer and it was just embarrassing her by this point. Her body trembled and red markings showed up on her large ass as he tormented the cheeks and upper thighs. "Nng..." closing her eyes tightly she panted out heavily and her cheeks quickly were pink again with lust.* - Sat Dec  5 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) grew very nervous with his words and how he had positioned himself. In an alarming voice she stuttered out, "C-c-claim it h-how?!"* - Sat Dec  5 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) trembled in fear of now understanding what he meant and honestly? That was too far for even a savage like her this soon. "I... I think we should stop..." whispered out and then she felt him pushing his hips in against her's and she spoke up in a whiney voice, "N-no.. S-sogeki..." She shut her eyes tightly in terror and a wave of dizziness before speaking up louder, "Please n-no!"* - Sat Dec  5 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) was flipped over with a grunt and her arms spread out all over the place and her hair spread out over the pillow beneath her head. When her eyes traveled down his body she saw what he had claimed her with and wanted to claim her backside with. He eyes grew wide and she turned red from forehead down to the center of he chest with embarrassment and curiousity about how his cock looked.* - Sat Dec  5 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) turned her eyes away as he was shifting her legs and being able to -see- it now made her more embarrassed. "A-bout what?"* - Sat Dec  5 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) parted her lips a bit more as she felt him running the tip back and forth over her slick sex. "You still want more? I... didn't know there was so much to this." She diverted her gaze in embarrassment of not knowing these things. "Y-yes... to both questions."* - Sat Dec  5 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) watched with lowered eyes as he pulled he sweater up and revealed her B sized breasts with tanned nipples that instantly hardened as he started to suck at one of the soft nubs. "S-sogekii..." whispered out as she panted gently and she felt him sinking back into her. She couldn't say she was excited to be enduring more of this, even if it felt amazing, since it did frighten her how much she enjoyed it when it disgusted her but at the same time she wanted him to be confident...and happy, and right now he was more confident than she had seen him in a long time.* - Sat Dec  5 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) relaxed a bit and as he stroked deeper and harder just at the end of each deep lunge. Tiny grunts sounded with each stretch of her weak inner walls from being so young and a virgin as she tried to put up with the strokes but she was growing sore and her abdomen hurt quite a bit from the deep but slow fucking. She could tell something was different about how he was going about it now but she didn't actually... feel such a connection as he did since to her sex was an disgusting act but he was making her enjoy it with the pleasure and danger of how he was going about it with the poison. 

She could see the lust and care in his eyes as she stared up to him and now was much more focused on watching him even while feeling the pleasure. She never had thought about the 'people watching' aspect of sex. It was proving interesting...* - Sat Dec  5 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) 's moans softened and she panted gently while staring up into his eyes. She didn't want to take her eyes off him as she saw that look in his eye, no one ever had looked at her that way before. Her breath hitched and she felt a swell of pleasure and emotions forcing her into a climax as she was pushed over the edge and whined out as her lower body ached from how deep he was stretching her pussy. "S-sogeki," whispered out in a breathy desire as she couldn't resist staring into his eyes, blinks became more and more sparse as she tried to see him for exactly who he was in this moment.* - Sat Dec  5 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) didn't close her eyes until he had pulled out and lowered down. Throughout his orgasm she was riding her's out and the post high buzz was keeping he in a sensation of enjoyable feelings while the worry about being sick was forgotten for the time being. She closed her eyes and panted gently out as he rested against her. She didn't mind the nuzzling into the pillow and her neck, "That... was something."* - Sat Dec  5 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) 's breathing calmed and as he gave her the antidote she felt the chilled liquid run down her arm and then soon enough she started to relax some and then groaned out in an ache as her muscles started to come back to life. "Who knew that it felt so much like a work out, my abs hurt so bad..." she had whispered in response and closed her eyes. * - Sat Dec  5 08:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) watched him as he pulled off her clothing and had her laying there naked. She tried to help by shifting here and there but when he looked at her nipples that way she felt like he might go back in for another dip. Her eyes watched him carefully and a sharp inhale occured as he leaned down to pick her up. Feeling the pain as he picked her up and a low growly groan sounded. 

When she was sat in the tub she tried to pull her feet away from where the water was going to fall as best she could so she wouldn't feel cold water as it adjusted. ---but then this guy had a small tub and she was weak from everything. He managed to get her toes and half her feet as she shuddered and her feet slipped down further into the cold and then hot water before finally hitting a good temperature. By that ending she was shaking and had a small chatter between her teeth. 

"I... can do it...." huffing gently and jutting her lip out as she looked away.* - Sat Dec  5 09:08:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) slowly nodded, "you always do that? You never train just get in a lot of fights? I mean we can fight... I just figured you'd actually like to learn something... I know I want to learn."* - Sun Dec  6 05:53:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) pursed her lips a bit more at his comment, "you didn't answer my question really... and you are kind of shit at Taijutsu. Do you want me to teach you taijutsu or something?"* - Sun Dec  6 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Ew. - Sun Dec  6 06:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes trailed over his upper body from a distance, he was only making it easier on her to find pressure points at this point, he realized that right? "I'm just going to kick your ass if we do taijutsu... what do you have to teach? Acting like you are the only one that is going to learn."* - Sun Dec  6 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow at his comment and glanced around at them being the only two. Soon after she pulled her hood back so it rest against her shoulders and her hair was free to fall over her shoulders and back.

"Seems like this won't be a jutsu lesson then, but a lesson of skill and disapline? Maybe I won't take it easy on you this time... course, I could always be nice if you promise not to use that bow of yours."* - Sun Dec  6 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Not even sure if this'll work.. - Sun Dec  6 07:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Worth the try.. - Sun Dec  6 07:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes in surprise of him tossing the bow to the side. She slowly started to walk towards him. "Why do you want me to go all out if you don't have your bow?" She reached up to her forehead and combed her bangs back out of the way and opened her third eye as it began to focus in on his position and watch the kunai. She didn't think she could do what had just crossed through her mind and it would be a waste of chakra. 

She neared his position and felt lazy honestly to a fight, she had hoped for some training in the area of teaching each other a skill or two and just having to focus chakra or form but hey, this is what she gets. She came to stand just out of range but if he leaned to reach he could probably get her with the kunai. Her lips pursed as her arms behind her remained folded back like they always did but one snaked down into a pouch just under her sweater she kept there, course he probably had seen this pouch of weapons before... it would be all up to his perception to know what she was doing as she gave him a cocky but slightly frustrated look as she peered at him with her three eyes.

Within an instant she had shot her hand that was retrieving weapons from her back pouch towards his body in a type of slick underhand. There were three senbon shot out and aimed at two pressure points on his left hip, and one at his lower left thigh. These of couse weren't perfect aim since she wasn't an amazing shot but thanks to her third eye she was able to focus better onto her target in that instant before shooting her third eye back up to the kunai in his grip. In the same moment she hat thrust the senbon forward she shifted forward and lowered her body down in a semi circle bow as she spun and then reached behind his right thigh and gripped with one hand onto the back of his hamstring to cause immense pain with her thumb and fingers pinching down on tendons and muscles to weaken his stance held.

Another hand shot up at the same moment to aim to knock his right arm away with a but of her palm to keep it from attacking her at the wrist, while two of her fists on her left side were aiming to punch quickly in fast succession against his torso in upper attacks at his diaphram and liver for attacks that felt worse from where she was hitting rather than how hard she was hitting. Through this all her feet remained sturdy on the ground and she tried to avoid any slashing of the blade, hoping that her rushed attack might throw him off and hesitate to use the weapon.* - Sun Dec  6 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) sucked in through her teeth as he kicked off backwards and avoided her grip around the back of his thigh, her hand just barely managed to graze along his thigh before he slipped away and had driven the dagger into a slashing movement through her sweater and against her flesh. She jerked back and reached up for her arm as the tingling and burning from the electric filled slash had surprised her. Narrowing her eyes she couldn't believe he had changed out poison for electricity. Fucking cheat.

Her lower lip jutted out as she panted out gently and stared over at him from the side, she wasn't sure if she wanted to continue anymore if he was going to fight dirty.* - Sun Dec  6 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) stood there staring at him from the side and her sweat began to become chakra filled and slowly she was being coated in an armor beneath her sweater so that the most vital areas of her body and arms were coated in a hardened shell of her special type of chakra filled armor that would keep his future attacks at bay if he tried to shock her again.* - Sun Dec  6 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) rose her brow, he clearly knew -something- since what she had done before hadn't been all that impressive since she failed so miserably. The fact he complimented her the way he did worried her further and she simply scoffed, "Tch... are you just going to play on the defense the entire time? That doesn't seem like a savage, thought I spent my time with someone worth my while, Sogeki?" Trying to taunt him.* - Sun Dec  6 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) squinted at his 'surrender' and then darted forward towards him and held one of her hands back far back as she flowed sweat out and formed a long spear trying to hide it behind her form in a classic waki-gamae stance (Though one handed) while she advanced forward with lumbering heavy and quick steps. 

As soon as she was near his position she aimed to grip the weapon with two more hands and swing in an downward and then upward strik from his thigh up towards his torso which would likely be used best to throw him back and probably hurt pretty fucking bad if she had managed to land the attack.

As soon as the weapon had been formed, chakra formed in her belly and she shot out a burst of four webs towards his body. Two aimed at his ankles, and the other two at his knee's trying to lock up his joints to hinder his movements away from her--if not stopping him entirely, an attempt to slow him down in both speed and his reflexive fighting style.* - Sun Dec  6 08:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) watched him evade the main attack but as she caught his feet and her third eye caught sight of the kunai she didn't know it was coated in her webbing when he first threw it but she easily avoided it by a leaning off to the side as the kunai flew between her giant spear and body with little control over the lightning over the web covered dagger. A snicker sounded as she took a simple few steps forward and held the long spear out and pointed it towards his throat even with his hands fully able to retaliate but he couldn't go anywhere right?

"Do you admit loss?"* - Sun Dec  6 08:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I dare him to try something. - Sun Dec  6 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) shrugged with a lazy blink of her eyes all but the one at the center of her forehead, it continued to watch him unwavering. Before he even had finished the sentence, at reaching the word 'isn't' she quickly flicked the spear away and then back in an attempt to smack him -hard- across the cheek that would likely cut his cheek open if he didn't avoid it. She was hoping to catch him off guard before he even hoped to challenge her. As soon as the spear had done it's planned work or even if it hadn't succeeded she darted back and looked him up and down.

She wasn't an idiot, the arrow was clearly not dripping with the purple poison, she had been around them enough to know that. Staying out or range she yawned gently with her sharp teeth showing. "Silly Sogeki, you may be a savage but even I know when to admit defeat, do I have to beat some sense into you? I rather not tire my chakra out."* - Sun Dec  6 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) pursed her lips with a cocky grin as she held the spear out to the side and down ready for another strike if she needed to commit to it. "Do you admit to loss then?"* - Sun Dec  6 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You -want- me to hurt you? - Sun Dec  6 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Just admit the loss. - Sun Dec  6 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Why admit something you already?~ - Sun Dec  6 09:05:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) turned her head away now and huffed out as she lowered the spear down more. He was mind fucking her well and she wasn't aware of it.* - Sun Dec  6 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hei, Sogeki(DhatBoiNick) says: Come, come. Get it over with.~ - Sun Dec  6 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) grumbled out and then rose the spear high and slashed down to deliver a harsh second gash to his other cheek. She felt wrong about it since she had more 'honor' than this at times, she knew when to admit defeat, not when to fight, and such... even if she was 'savage' she had her limits.* - Sun Dec  6 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) grumbled and tossed the spear to the side, "You are a freaking masocist..." She stepped forward and crouched at his feet to touch the two webs on his feet and unweaved them as if they were simply spiderwebs, it made no logical sense.* - Sun Dec  6 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah well...--...tch. - Sun Dec  6 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) stood up again and peered up to him before reaching up and combing her bangs back over her eye and closing to rest.* - Sun Dec  6 09:18:04 2015
