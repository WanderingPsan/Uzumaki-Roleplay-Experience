<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) hadn't seen any immediate alarm but it was clear that they were getting into it about something. She kept walking for now even if Ortho hadn't made her leave. She was sure she would hear about it later if he was venting or some stupid sensei shit like that. She went into Ortho's house and made tea like a real bitch.* - Sun Nov 15 03:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was simply making tea as if she hadn't seen anything.* - Sun Nov 15 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) frowned as he was about to head back out the house after only retrieving clean clothes but not cleaning up. "Why don't you just shower? And I made tea," she didn't look to him, when a person is like he is they don't especially like being looked at.* - Sun Nov 15 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ..you don't need time? - Sun Nov 15 04:02:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...w-what? - Sun Nov 15 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) now turned around with the teapot in hand.* - Sun Nov 15 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rubbed her lips together and sat the pot down on the stove before following him. The blood on his body didn't bother her but she wondered why the sudden want to try out the shower with her inside of it with him. Course it was obvious what he wanted but at the same time, wanting -that- right after a fight was pretty... risque? She was going to go with that word rather than the darker choices.* - Sun Nov 15 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow as she looked him over with the blood soaked on him, she didn't want to assume they were going to have sex so she didn't make any filthy fucking jokes about him being coated in blood. She then began to unbutton her shirt and dropped it to the ground while kicking off her boots and then letting her skirt drop. Finally her undergarments were removed but she really didn't need a shower but was going to join him anyway, not like he even gave her a choice he sort of ordered it the douche. With another look over him she pursed her lips a small amount, "You first, you have a lot of blood on you, unless you want me to go first."* - Sun Nov 15 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was confused by how -serious- he was actually being. Was he talking about training or -training-. She rubbed her lips together as she had been pulled into the shower and stands with a light chill going over her body while looking over to him soaping up a rag. "U-uhm, yeah, of course Sensei."* - Sun Nov 15 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rubbed her lips together while watching him soap himself up and it was -very- distracting. All the red blood turning pink agains this skin, his tattoo, his scars.... the swollen muscles from the fight he was involved in... She was staring at all of it while trying to remain professional because of how serious he was being. She didn't soap herself up but simply stood there in front of him naked and hugging her torso with her breasts resting above her folded arms and responding to his questions. "Wind, Sir. I haven't gotten the chance to delve too far into it with jutsu but I have good contrl over the element. I want to use it as a back up and amplifier for my fire."* - Sun Nov 15 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) frowned now at the fact he had winced, "Are you hurt, Sir?" She lowered her arms and looked to his side at the large bruise, "You probably should ice that."* - Sun Nov 15 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) blinked, "You want me to try and use concussive wind chakra on a bar of wet soap?" She looked up to him like he was crazy as she held onto it and it threatened to slip out of her hands. She looked down at it and sighed before forming her chakra into her lungs and then with a single pucker of her lips blew out over the soap and it flowed over the soap just as he wanted with ease, she -had- told him she knew how to use fuuton but he hadn't listened.* - Sun Nov 15 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....L-levitate? - Sun Nov 15 05:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov 15 05:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) watched what he was doing and widened her eyes in shock. Honestly she was too distracted to realize he had been stroking his cock right in front of her because the idea of making the soap levitate seemed impossible. When he did it so easily she realized it was possible and then was prepared to try. Leaning against the shower's inner wall as her hair became humid and curlier from the humid steam with her backside against the cool outer glass siding she tried to flow her chakra into the soap but with her attempt not going so well the soap cracked down the center from too much chakra applied in one spot.* - Sun Nov 15 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was getting cold since she was in the heat of the shower but not under the water and leaning against a cold glass siding. Her nipples stood hard and gooseflesh was crawling over her skin as the tone of her skin paled slightly due to the chill across her body. She closed her eyes now as she concentrated her focus onto the soap and around it more so than it's center of gravity. She felt her wind chakra forming and flowing over the soap like she had done when she was blowing but now she was trying to make it form a pocket of wind around the soal rather than just moving away from it after flowing over the slippering fragile surface. It was working but not visible but it was certainly making a chilly wind rotate just around the soap without picking it up.* - Sun Nov 15 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gasped out in a sigh of relief as he put her under the hot water, color came back to her skin and she smiled faintly as her body began to pinken up from the heat. "Thank you," <I thought he was going to torture me until I got it.> her eyes peered back down to the soap and she focused more and more chakra around the soap. Soon enough visible lines of air were seen dragging the steam with it and a vortex was being created but the soap hadn't lifted just yet, she was taking it slow to assure she had the proper control and wasn't going to explode the soap bar and send little shards stabbing the two of them in the small shower.* - Sun Nov 15 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) muttered, "Right..." she was fully concentrated now and not even thinking about anything close to sexual. Everything was about doing this right to learn and impress her mentor. With  a little kick of the wind chakra under the soap it slowly began to hover just above her hand. A determined look in her eyes of accomplishment was present but she didn't smile, only concentrated to keep it going until he approved.* - Sun Nov 15 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) glanced up to him and she had -thought- she had it already but apparently what she was doing wasn't good enough. Applying a few more strands of refined wind chakra she floated it higher up into the shower's empty area and allowed it to begin spinning faster and faster.* - Sun Nov 15 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) caught the soap and set it back in the dish before turning off the shower and stepping out with her body soaked but not actually having gone through effort to clean herself. Some how standing in a hot shower without using soap had ended up making her feel dirtier than cleaner. She stood on the towel mat looking towards him while shivering.* - Sun Nov 15 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was surprised how he was...taking care of her? She allowed him to wrap her in the towel with hair dripping off of the little curls that had formed in her hair. He probably hadn't gotten to see it like this before since she kept her head out of the water at the river and it hadn't gotten heated up to bounce back to it's natural state. Turning back around to face him she kept her head down respectfully since he had honestly been very serious and to the point, demanding, and mentor-like. She wasn't wanting to upset him or possibly get him off basis currently so she kept away from the word 'sensei'. "Thank you, Sir."* - Sun Nov 15 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) swallowed hard as he lifted her chin to force her to look up. A thin smile tugged at her lips but she said nothing to his comment.* - Sun Nov 15 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't kiss him back, she let him kiss her with her eyes slowly blinking before looking up to him again. She was now holding the towel where it was tied between her breasts with a light press of her fingers gripping the knotted area. "I've never thought about it, how could I do that?"* - Sun Nov 15 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's lips parted as he was brushing over her chin with his thumb and listening. When he finished she spoke up, "I'll learn whatever you want to teach me... but my focus is fire the most, I want to become the best fire user to ever live... and achieve greatness in my family's abilities, if there is anything else to learn from the heritage."* - Sun Nov 15 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes flicked down as he was lost in thought, not wanting to stare.* - Sun Nov 15 06:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes rose back up but to his hand running down her arm and then side towards the towel. Her eyes soon finding his own curiously.* - Sun Nov 15 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) let her hand over the knot fall to her side to allow him to do as he pleased, she wondered why he was so quiet after how demanding he had been earlier.* - Sun Nov 15 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt a little intimidated by him keeping eye contact for so long but maintained it because she trusted him. With her lightly damp but mostly dry body picked up and legs wrapped about his waist she could feel his length lightly tapping against her rump as he carried her into the bedroom. Her hands wrapped behind the back of his neck as she stared back and it almost forced her into an obsession of activating her sharingan because looking into his eyes were like portals it seemed.* - Sun Nov 15 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) kissed him back gently but she was having to force herself into control since she never had sex this way... this was... love making. She swallowed hard and had to gasp to resist moving too much as he teased her body and loved it in a way she wasn't familiar with. Her eyes watched him carefully and curiously but she was trying to figure out what he was up to, was he trying to make her feel for him? Shakily she rubbed her lips together and then licked between them with a hard swallow afterwards while he continued to touch her small body all over.* - Sun Nov 15 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) inhaled gently and exhaled slow and heavy as he teased down her body. The kisses along her body sent shooting tingles throughout her and when he actually latched his lips about her nipple and licked forward with a snap she moaned a feminine sound that only a young girl could make. Her hands that were at her sides slowly rubbed along the sheets of the bed and gripped them in tight fist fulls above her head as she tried to hold still enough to let him have his way even if she wanted to act out. Something about this was nice but it was making her feel way to much all things considered, she told herself maybe he just wanted to be gentle after his fight? That could be it... maybe he wanted to show her how proud he was for her accomplishments, that could also be it.* - Sun Nov 15 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) turned her head up so her chin was high in the air when he moved to her neglected nipple, leaving the other to grow cold from the saliva and harden further in the chill air compared to his tongue and lips which kept the nipple cozy. The hand going down her body sent a rush through her with endorphines releasing and her heart pumping. Back arched a tiny bit but she forced herself to lay back down as she simply curled her toes and then squeezed the sheets tighter. 

When those fingers gripped her clit though and pinched she couldn't help a pleasured moan, she sounded nearly like a pup howling gently in it's sleep from the attention given to her. A tiny whispered and breathy, "fuu-uck..." sounded as she tried to stay quiet but he was playing her like a musical instrument. The fingers that pressed past her extremely small opening only served to cause her to clench -hard-, that was the one thing she wasn't able to control a strong reaction from.* - Sun Nov 15 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes for a moment as he traveled down her body. When he was finally between her legs she lifted her head just a bit to peer down at him and the sight alone drove her mad. A moan sounded and she shuddered with her body shaking back and forth in a small squirm. The cool blowing sensation made her arch her back now, she couldn't stop it and it stayed with her breasts up in the air and her ribs peaking at the arch. The fingers were noted and squeezed on as a dribble of her juices flowed down from her opening and along her ass crack to disappear along her tight and tiny pucker.* - Sun Nov 15 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) leaned her head back again and looked up at the ceiling as she started to pant as he shoved the finger in deep. His hands were so big and he was enormous compared to her but it was nothing compared to his lower girth. She reached down with one hand to grip his hair as gently as she could because she was trying to stay gentle but her body was wound up like a spring. Her other hand still gripping the sheets tightly enough above her head that her elbow was up in the air with her upper inner arm pressed against her cheek and temple while her cheeks turned pink from her body being so heated.

With his licking keeping her on edge but him never giving her speed or release she was being pushed closer and closer to the edge of a cliff he just wouldn't allow her to fall off of. She wondered for a moment if he was doing all this intentionally or really was just trying to pleasure her, perhaps he liked the taste of pussy even? Her pussy did taste great... it was silky, incredibly clean, and hardly any flavor but a subtle 'sex' musk to the tastebuds and scent, a little sweet on the after taste even. Or maybe the other reason which still lingered in the back of her mind was that he was trying to make love to her, he certainly was hitting the spot emotionally....* - Sun Nov 15 08:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) couldn't take being soft anymore, as he quickened his pace she gripped his hair roughly and growled out her next moan in sensuality. She was holding it together pretty well but as he started to lick from bottom to top it sent her over board. Writhing as she wrapped her legs into a lock behind his neck and squeezed so he was forced in tightly against her cunt. Moaning out with a whine following in high pitch as she hyperventilated and her inner walls spasmed as juices flowed strong and squirted against his tongue from the oral stimulation. This was one of her favorite things to experience but he had turned it into a whole new world and it was forcing her to moan like she hadn't the last time they enjoyed each other's bodies, last time had been screams...this time it was surrender.* - Sun Nov 15 08:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gasped out and felt dizzy as he forced her into a high from the second orgasm instantly triggering. She took only a few moments of what seemed like forever for her to loose her climax and come down from it but her high persisted making her feel like she was floating. The hand in his hair eased out of the grip, as well as the hand above her head. Both went lax as her legs unlocked from behind his neck and hung limp over his shoulders after falling gently down his back. The girl was panting heavily with lids half open and unable to move other than spasming every so often with gooseflesh and red splotches all over her body from the pleasure.* - Sun Nov 15 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was still high with the bliss but as he stroked gently it was the most... complete feeling she had ever sexually. How he just stroked her gently even after it was said and done, not pulling away or even just pulling away just to cuddle or something stupid like that. He was lingering and giving her little hiccups of spasms of pleasure that made her inhale sharply at times and whine lightly with others. Her eyes closed and opened slowly with each blink and lips remained parted slightly while damp from her licking over them so often, swollen from the number of times she had bitten down on them through the entire process. If she hadn't been so high she might have cared about him moving her around like a doll or the fact he was rock hard and wanting, aching even, but she couldn't think about any of those matters, just the feeling.* - Sun Nov 15 09:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) came around to opening her eyes wide enough she could see but still quite low and reached back towards his leg that was the nearest thing she could touch in the position he had her in. Making eye contact before looking down to his engorged manhood and knowing he needed pleased before this could be over. She was pretty sure if she tried to move her body entirely she might just flop over or roll off the bed. "Let me return the favor," whispered out in a sore voice from all the moaning she had been doing.* - Sun Nov 15 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) groaned as he didn't come around towards her front end and mumbled something about 'motherfucker's being lazy' but she had a goofy smile of happiness as she rolled over a bit and twisted to shift herself around to face him now between his legs where she lay on her belly and moved closer as her gaze fell onto the member that looked so painfully stretched and then up to his gaze. She reached up with her left hand and guided his cock downwards so it stretched just right to probably send him into a moan which she did so both intentionally to tease him but also to get the head lined up with her lips as she lay between his legs with breasts brushing against his balls. Licking over her lips she could feel her mouth water just as her tongue extended out and sent a swirling lick over the head and around the very end. Her lips brushed in a small kiss that drug from the middle of the head upwards as she was gentle for once and teased him with little movements like this for a few seconds.

Soon enough her eyes rose to lock onto his own, more aware now than she was in the daze and giving him the look like she wanted to suck his cock all night. That look could really kill some time and only two seconds after she had looked at him that way her mouth had lowered and began to suck with warm lips and tongue against the head just at the under curve. Tongue flicked back and forth in an 'S' shape along the crease along the bottom and it was obvious how much she enjoyed it. Her left hand that rested at the base of his length slowly guided up with thumb rubbing along the large protruding vein. Making it's way all the way up to the head before dragging some of her saliva back down over the length and then up again in a painfully slow manner to likely do to him what he had done to her. All the while she was staring him in the eyes with that look of want and craving, like the taste of his manhood was the only thing in the world she could devour from now on, tiny moans gasping out and humming against her tongue and lips to vibrate the very head of his length. Her right hand slowly went along his hip and then up along his belly as she had fingers spread feeling out over his chest and scars. Making him feel wanted and seduced to the best of her ability in love making like this.* - Sun Nov 15 09:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled around the head of his cock and then lowered down with a tiny bob, then up again and then lower once more. Repeating his action until she had taken in half of his length because let's be honest... she is a very tiny girl and he had a very large cock considering his height, and ego (cough). She flicked her tongue back and fourth in the 'S' shape against the large vein and contracted her throat purposely to tease him as he entered her throat. The hand wandering over his chest and thighs massaged the muscle just above his cock on his lower abdomen, many didn't know about the location being stimulating since it was so subtle all it did was increase the blood flow to the area. Her hand that had been around his length moved down under his balls and found another secret spot she began to rub with her thumb. Not quite to that cute manly pucker she had toyed with before but a little knot of nerves hidden under the ball sack before his taint. Massaging it more and more as she built in pressure but nothing too hard for him to handle which would essentially try and force him over the edge, sometimes this worked so effectively on men that they came so quickly it was embarrassing for them. It always did work out nicely for power play on Eri's end.* - Sun Nov 15 10:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) grumbled a bit at him gripping her hair, men always did like doing that but she hated it. It took the control she had away and then he pushed her down, that was the -worst- thing about a blow job. Not because she didn't want to go lower but because the force of having someone make you go down versus going down yourself was extremely obtrusive and made the woman vunerable. Her eyes watered from him entering her throat entirely and she gagged some but stayed as she held onto his hips and his orgasm began to spurt down her throat to the point she wasn't going to have to even swallow. The way he said her name though... that was enough to make her moan loudly and hold her breath for a little longer for his pleasure, she didn't give her first name to anyone... at least no one but him and the snakes of the cave.~

When he had finished, she slowly rose her head and gasped for air for a few moments holding herself up with a hand on the bed of either side of his hips. Once she had caught her breath she lowered back down and began to clean him off entirely with long laps of her tongue wherever his cock needed it. Even finally reaching for his fingers and licking them clean from when he was fingering her. Her eyes then looked up to his once again and she muttered in upset, "you didn't even let me taste it....hmph."* - Sun Nov 15 10:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled and pulled herself up and over his leg and then up beside him to lay with one of her legs draped over his own so her upper thigh was pressed against his resting cock and balls and her arm was across his chest with her breasts pressed against his rib cage and side. "Yeah, that's what they usually say.~"* - Sun Nov 15 11:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's heart was pounding hard enough from that one statement it was impossible for her to hide it. "Uh, yeah....who would have thought."* - Sun Nov 15 11:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) remained silent with her ear against his chest listening to his heart and it was steady as a drum unlike her's that was thumping like a bee's hive in heat. "I've never made love before..."* - Sun Nov 15 11:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....y-yeah... - Sun Nov 15 11:21:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) reached out for the bottle of sake and took a long hard gulp ...and then another. "Just never thought I would enjoy that kind of sex."* - Sun Nov 15 11:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...we need to be careful. - Sun Nov 15 11:29:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov 16 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You need to act like that when things like this come up in public. - Mon Nov 16 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You should have shut that down -so fast-. - Mon Nov 16 07:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Lets get it out of the way. - Mon Nov 16 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) walked further into the house other than the main entry way and sat down on the couch looking over to him with a heavy sigh. "You got things to say."* - Mon Nov 16 07:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Mon Nov 16 07:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) listened to what he had to say while closing her eyes, "if we did that there's a possibility of conflict when your girl comes back around."* - Mon Nov 16 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow but didn't ask about why his girl was with his brother, "So she moved on?"* - Mon Nov 16 07:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You love her. - Mon Nov 16 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: By all means.. I swear I was in love with her.. but I just feel like being in love with someone.. some form of feelings has to be returned.. - Mon Nov 16 08:03:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shifted on the couch and laid her legs across Ortho's lap with them crossed at the ankle. She had kicked her boots off at some point when she walked from the door to the couch and now rested back against the arm of the couch.* - Mon Nov 16 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes in thought, this was a lot to consider but eventually she sighed out gently. "If we take it slow.... really slow."* - Mon Nov 16 08:11:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Like you were a real student? - Mon Nov 16 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) opened her eyes to look at him and gave him a flirty wink which she hardly ever did.* - Mon Nov 16 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: So straight to the point.... - Mon Nov 16 08:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Ugh... - Mon Nov 16 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Speaking of. - Mon Nov 16 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You are a -real- bastard. - Mon Nov 16 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: New rule. - Mon Nov 16 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Oooooh, rules now.~ - Mon Nov 16 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) inhaled sharply as she just stared at him like he just hit an upgrade button for men.* - Mon Nov 16 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Should -I-? Or do you want to do the honors for cresening your new rule? - Mon Nov 16 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: She.. don't know what she just got herself into. - Mon Nov 16 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Pick a number from one through six. - Mon Nov 16 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a single brow at him, "Three."* - Mon Nov 16 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Evens she strip..dance. - Mon Nov 16 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Odds i- - Mon Nov 16 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: FUCK. - Mon Nov 16 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: .... - Mon Nov 16 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Strip. - Mon Nov 16 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) squinted at him.* - Mon Nov 16 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Mon Nov 16 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her lip and quickly darted forward with a toss forward of her weight and smoothly came to be straddling his lap with a knee on either side of his thighs and hovering her rump just above his knee's so she wasn't sitting on him.* - Mon Nov 16 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Nngn... - Mon Nov 16 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her tongue forcing herself not to say anything but the way he was talking was easily getting to her. She held still with her hands held out to her sides some so she wasn't holding any of her clothing down. When he got the shirt open she rolled her shoulders to let it fall to the ground between Ortho's feet. Watching as he started to tug at her skirt and forcing herself to take shallow slow breathes.* - Mon Nov 16 08:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes slowly and lifted her chin just a bit when he squeezed down, a sharp inhale slowly following through her nostrils before exhaling slowly through slightly parted lips. Her eyes reopened to lock their stares again as he spoke, "Whatever you order, Sir."* - Mon Nov 16 08:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt her skin crawl from what he was doing but she kept it together since this wasn't that bad so far. Hell he hadn't even fully undressed her, she was good... right? "No, but I'll learn whatever you teach me, Sir."* - Mon Nov 16 08:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes as he was peeling off the skirt and she could feel her heart beating a million times a minute. His questions were heard but she was struggling to listen to the meaning, his tone... -alone-, was enough to drive her into a fit of moans but she was keeping quiet and being a 'good student'. "I've never thought about either of those... really. Maybe fuuinjutsu because of the snake contract, medical? Not even... I care about very few enough to save their lives with pausing to heal them, and when it comes to saving the lives of those I care I would fight for them rather than heal them, Sir." The way he had to lift her leg made her lean forward and she was forced to grip the back of the couch with her right hand to the side of his skull. Her other hand stayed hovering in the air out of the way. When it was finally off he would see her wearing lacy black panties and bra that had places that were see through from the mesh net type of material woven into the lace. There were ribbons of golden color weeved in and out of the lace along all the edges and a small golden ribbon rose in the center between her breasts with matching roses on each of the straps where they met with the cups of her bra and one dead center at the top hem of her panties.* - Mon Nov 16 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was having trouble thinking as he moved the straps of her bra down. "U-uhm..." she was trying to think but nothing was coming around as he undid the clasp behind her shoulder blades. "I think maybe that uh... I wouldn't be good with taijutsu, Sir. See I mean... look at my little body? I'm built for moving fast, right? Not standing still... perhaps... I... well, I don't think I would be very good at hitting anyone." She swallowed hard and then quickly added on, "Sir!" <This was easier when he was torturing me with cold water...and just touching himself.>* - Mon Nov 16 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: God why does he have to -touch- me while talking like this. - Mon Nov 16 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gasped now as her hand that was floating came to place on the other side of his head against the back of the couch. She was trying her damnest as he carressed her but she was losing it and she wanted this to continue...how he spoke, treated her, made her do things... it was hot as hell and she wanted it to keep going but he was pushing her too close to moaning. 

"I think... I think... ngn...Sir... I think that's a g-great idea, b-but also... I... ngn.. I'm having trouble concentrating with the ways of your teaching... fogging my mind, Sir." She closed her eyes tightly and then reopened them to look down into his gaze. There was lust behind them that she was trying to hide and having a hard time doing so, she didn't mind occasional touches to tease her while he did all this but with the current setting... on his lap, undressing her, touching her... it was too much.* - Mon Nov 16 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wanted to whine from the fact he ignored her but as his hand traveled down she was trying to mentally prepare herself for what was to come. She gripped the back of the couch tighter and tighter until her knuckles turned white. When his hand finally gripped her cleft she grunted softly and then had to lower her head and lean closer to him without touching his body with a fast inhale and exhale turning into a pant as she bit down hard on her lip to stop from moaning. She nodded her head quickly to him with their hair brushing against each other as he spoke. Forcing herself to finally speak out in a wavering voice, "Yes, Sir, a-anything you deem fit, S-sir."* - Mon Nov 16 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded quickly to his confirmation with a heavy gasp and pant following as her head remained down. She was nearly resting her forehead against his shoulder but resisting to continue the game. When he pulled the panties away she knew what was coming soon but was trying to just hold back the moans...that's the only thing she had going for her was that she wasn't moaning. Even the graze over her exposed lip made her see stars but she only dropped her head down against his shoulder for a few seconds before forcing herself back up. "S-sorry, Sir... I d-don't know what's come over me, perhaps... I-i'm ill...ngnng... y-yes, that's it, Sir... Just...s-sick.." She shuddered and her kegal flexed inside of her as she anticipated his next actions.

When the fingers moved inside of her this time with ease she couldn't help the whine that sounded desperately. Gasping as her breathing quickened and then she forced herself to speak up to answer his question, "M-maybe I would be good at scouting. You know..hiding... watching from a distance... moving quickly like I said. I'm small, it fits...Fuu---excuse me, Sir... I'm not trying to be rude, Sir."* - Mon Nov 16 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) could see what he was doing clear as day because of how her head was tilted downwards, as she saw him undoing the zipper she was already starting to shake like a leaf with both anticipation and worry of how she was going to be able to handle this situation. "I-i don't th-think I need anymore physical activity, S-sir.. I...j-just went for a run... ngnng.. l-like.. " She could feel juices running down her thigh along where he was touching her, it was obvious how turned on she was by the situation.

Gasping for breath and holding it for a moment as she yelled at herself in her head to get it together. "Whatever you think is best for me, Sir... I am your student, Sensei." She dreaded that she said that title now but it wasn't able to be resisted as she saw the full giant length ready to be pushed inside of her, part of her craved it...while another part of her hoped he was just trying to tease her.* - Mon Nov 16 10:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: if she wants to - Mon Nov 16 10:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was shaking quite drastically now as he lined up with her lips and she nearly sobbed for a moment. Her head couldn't stay up anymore, she pressed it against his shoulder as he asked her the questions and spoke about stupid fucking training which she was growing to hate deep down. "N-no of course not, Sensei. I could never be angry with you, I hope I'm n-not being a bad student, pl-please forgive me if I am...nngn..S-sir... " She felt dizzy but was holding it together the last little bit. Her hips dipped and rose some but he was holding her firmly and she could just feel how he was pulsating making her pussy juices drip down along his head to get his cock wet. It was going to be almost too easy for him to enter her if he ever did, even with as tight and small her body was...* - Mon Nov 16 10:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) jerked her head up suddenly at those words and tried to get off of him but she likely couldn't get away unless he chose to release her. If he hadn't released her she would literally -scream- both in agonizing relief of finally being filled but also in anger and fear of what he had just said. (I wont write more because I need to know what you allow)* - Mon Nov 16 10:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) practically sobbed at the ultimatum and screamed again before punching his chest quickly with her right first and then the second before remaining atop him fully sitting down with her legs bent. She screamed agian into his chest at him ruining 'the moment' and then tried to punch him again in the chest/shoulder in anger and emotional train wreck.* - Mon Nov 16 10:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt her eyes burning and she didn't want to cry like a little bitch over him saying those words but this whole situation was forcing her to feel strongly for him while hating him at the same time. The way he worked in and out of her was background noise that only served to release endorphines and other hormones that made it all harder to push away. She punched him a few more times fighting and trying to get away without a word other than whines, grunts of trying to escape, and screams before she finally started to sob against his chest as he fucked her. This had turned from what was the most amazing night she had thus far into one of the bad times, she couldn't say worst because of the things she's been through but he was making her unlock emotions she had long ago forced away, hell she had never felt it in a way directed to someone she -wanted-. 

Her hands gripped his shirt and she cried -hard- it was obvious she couldn't control it by the sounds and how her chest shook so it clearly wasn't for attention of any kind. Slowly her head rose after a few moments of only crying and she sighed out heavily as the crying that was forced out had passed and now she could stop herself and the tears stopped pouring. If he had kept going by this point she pressed her nose and lips against his neck casually and breathed from between her lips as her panting became more sensual as the rise and fall of her hips continued.* - Mon Nov 16 11:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) swallowed hard and released another sigh as she got over the crying mess that she had been. Her tears began to dry and she stopped holding his shirt so tightly. Hands slowly ran along his chest, over collar bone, and then back behind his neck to finger through his hairline gently. She licked over her bottom lip and sucked it in before softly moaning out a breathy gasp as her hips began to move with his grip. 

Another hard swallow and she opened her eyes for only a second before closing them again and kissing his neck as her lower back arched and she felt herself now leading the motions up and down against his lap. Soon enough she felt numb but to the two bodies pressing together. Whining gently and sounds of her lips kissing his neck and licking gently with small nibbles could be heard clear as day. Her hips moved in circles forward to back as she picked up the pace. Soon enough she was kissing up his neck to his jawline with a tender bite along the edge. Her lips moving along the cheek just before his ear and her hands in his hair were running further and further up as her arms shifted and she readjusted her position with a small shift. 

Pulling her head back just enough to skip over the tears falling down his cheeks she opened her eyes to look at him with her swollen cheeks and eyes with red veins breaking up the whites, they both looked a hot mess but right now she just wanted to look him in the eyes as they did far to often likely. Always lingering their gaze too long...

With her forehead coming to meet his own she blinked slowly with a panting brushing breath over his lips as her hips worked harder and deeper than ever before. Just one quick motion and her lips found his, pressing tightly, massaging, and mingling their tastes together to become one. There was only him in that moment and nothing else in the world, he was becoming her everything and it terrified her that her world was beginning to revolve around him. Hell, she wanted to call him a liar for what he had said but she simply kissed deeper to the point she couldn't breath and it felt like her lungs were going to give out.* - Mon Nov 16 11:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) broke the kiss with heavy gasps as her hands had been on either side of his head with thumbs in front of his ears. She could feel herself losing sanity all because of Ortho, at least she thought that's what she was feeling right now. Hips rotating, smacking and she was on the edge of a heavy orgasm that she knew was going to build and build before caving. She looked back into his gaze if he had reopened his eyes and was determined to have them both meet their endings together. Eri felt like she was about to have a heart attack with what she was feeling and it was making her body hurt, her mind hurt, her heart... she couldn't even fully understand the feeling unlike Ortho was able to, at least to a small degree.

"Sensei," her words echoing out in a hushed breath as she gave him another kiss but softer this time and squeezed tightly around his manhood. She reached down with one hand to her lower abdomen pushing a spread out hand against her belly to force it to feel tighter and rougher. "Together," whispered out finally after moments of her struggling to speak another word while she looked him in the eyes. Lips quivering and trying to kiss him on and off while her hand against his jaw held tightly with a few fingers through his hair. She felt the climax peaking just at the moment she was going to be sent into a flurry of tingles. Her body hitched, her breathing caught and she lowered down slowly with wider slower circles as she kissed him hard once again and moaned within her chest in a way that isn't heard or felt often by those who are simply 'having sex'. Even their love making wasn't anything compared to this, it was all of their firey passion and love making mingling in perfect harmony. Eri couldn't have asked for more in an entire life span...* - Mon Nov 16 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) couldn't think about all the emotional things going through her head right now, she could certainly feel them though. It was undeniably present to the very end and as he filled her with his seed she hadn't even thought about what she -welcomed- him to do. Panting heavily as her hips slowed and then she rested against him panting with her hands lax behind his head against the back of the couch and her chest against his chest, head just under his chin, and her bottom against his lap fully with all of him inside of her. Eri's body ached from emotion and the physical strain of riding someone so much bigger than her, in her book later she probably would tell herself she deserved a medal. 

Her breathing began to slow but as it did and her high from the orgasm began to subside was when her emotional thoughts came back into view. The words he said echoed through her mind, her doubts of if he was telling the truth were abundant and her own fear of if it was true were terrifying her young mind. Mingling with all of that was the absolute certainty that she was going to end up loving him and what if he was lying? Then she would be the same girl she has been so many times in the past with her family and others she stayed intentionally away from because of their lack of emotion. 

Eri then realized what she had asked Ortho to do, her eyes slowly widening as she became more and more aware but luckily she was out of his line of sight so she could have her mini panic attack. It was already said and done so there was no way to prevent it now if it was already happening. She was having an anxiety attack but one of the things Eri was best at was keeping her anxiety under wraps. Her eyes relaxed and only stayed dialated as she began to breath normally. All the while inside of the back of her mind she was beginning the long drawn out panic that was going to be present for at least a few weeks time.* - Mon Nov 16 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) slowly lifted her head to look at him and she wasn't smiling but she didn't look mad either. "Can we.... clean up and get some breakfast?" Her voice was hoarse and she could hardly speak from all the screaming she had been doing, not to mention panting and crying. 

Her eyes were glazed over, red, swollen... she just wanted to be clean... in some warm clothes and to talk about what he said right now. She didn't want to think about the last bit that happened but she wasn't going to be able to -not- think about it. If he said  yes to her request, with a heavy groan and pain as her knee's and hip popped, she stood up with his and her fluids trailing out of her and down her leg in a steady thick stream. Just the -feel- of what was running down her leg made her tremble and she nearly fell. At first she thought it was her nerves but really it had been the fact she was in the position for so long. 

Stumbling a few steps she caught herself with a hand on the coffee table and a bumped knee. "I'm fine..." was reassured as she walked her way in what would look like a 'drunken stupor' towards the bathroom expecting him to follow of course, unless he needed some alone time after what just happened.* - Mon Nov 16 12:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) made it into the bathroom, she was numb now. Numb and dirty feeling by both physical and emotional means. He guided her into the shower and she stood there for a moment until he had finished testing the water, she was just staring at the water fall with her bloodshot gaze. As soon as the water started to pull of steam she stepped under it fully and the water fell over her body from the crown of her head down. Hair plastered to her face, ears, and neck as she soaked under it. She didn't cry now, even when she could while it was hidden by the water. Instead she reached up and rubbed her hair out of her face enough and gasped out as she tilted her head up and started rubbing her body hard like someone trying to get clean as deeply as possible without having used soap.

She only did this for a short while as she rubbed her face, neck, and upper chest before finally stepping back enough the water wasn't hitting her in the face and she could open her eyes. Reaching out for the bar of soap he had taught her how to control wind flow, she rubbed it hard under the water before beginning to soap herself down with a rag and was rubbing to the point her skin began to turn red.* - Mon Nov 16 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) scrubbed her entire body but the focus of her heavy scrubbing hadn't been between her legs. In fact it had been mainly focused on her face and her chest where she had been crying, as well as her hands. She handed him the bar of soap and a fresh rag since her's was likely covered in both of their juices from her taking the time to make sure she was thoroughly cleaned out before rinsing her body while he was soaping down. She washed her hair because she wanted to be extra clean, even if it wasn't a day for her to wash her hair she found it as necessary. If he was still washing she shifted around him and stepped out. Taking a heavy towel and drying off before simply dropping it on the ground with her hair fully curled and bouncy and in all directions. She walked over to the mirror and used her hand to wipe a streak across it.

Staring at herself and the last sign of her crying was the bloodshot eyes. She looked through his cabinets, trying to find eye drops if he had any...he was a nurse after all so he likely did. If she found any she dripped two drops into both eyes before replacing it in the cabinet and then took out all her piercings and placed them in the rinsing cup sitting on the counter to put back in later. She was fully clean, just herself staring back at her. She could hardly recognize herself without any make up, piercings, or her hair straightened in a relaxed wavey shag. She ran her hands through her hair at how messy it was and got it into a type of order that looked reasonable before walking into the bedroom where her belongings were since it seemed they had ended up living together since Ortho never moved out after giving her the house. 

Searching through her clothing she pulled on a pair of black cotton panties, a black simple bra and followed them with a pair of dark grey sweat pants for running along with a simple black t-shirt. She then tugged on a zip up hoodie and left it open followed by a pair of casual sneakers and plain black ankle socks. When she was finished she waited on the bed for Ortho to be done for them to go. She still hadn't said a word since running into the coffee table.* - Mon Nov 16 13:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked up to him and then stood as she gave him a glance that she was ready and started to head for the door. About half way to the door she determined that she had been quiet so long she needed to give him some sign that she wasn't traumatized or something. Reaching out for his hand while they walked to the door she held onto it warmly until they were right at the entry way and then squeezed lightly and released his hand for her own to disappear into her pocket.

She didn't look back up at him for now as they head out of the house, making their way through the streets towards the market place where the various shops were. She headed into the first place that served food this early and took a seat in the very back booth facing the door with her eyes. She always did this, they hadn't eaten together much but she always made sure no matter where she was eating she was facing the door even when she was in the very back so she could see if something was coming. 

Once she was seated a waiter came over quickly, it was extremely early so there was no customers in the shop currently and only one waiter and a single cook. They actually didn't fully open for another half hour but didn't dare turn away customers such as the leader of the settlement and his student. She looked up to the man now looking normal and just like a student after a long training session from how tired she might have looked and freshly cleaned. "Coffee, black." * - Mon Nov 16 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) added on after Ortho just did his full order. "Tamagoyaki, steamed rice, and miso soup," she then looked down at the table and folded her fingers together as the waiter walked away and Ortho spoke up about the coffee. She simply shook her head and then waited a long moment before speaking on the next topic in a very low voice so only Ortho could hear. 

"No one has ever said that to me before."* - Mon Nov 16 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head at his statement and then looked up at him with serious eyes full of emotion. "No I'm serious, -no one- has -ever- said that to me."* - Mon Nov 16 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: It's just.... - Mon Nov 16 14:18:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: But I'm glad that you did... say it... even in your terrible timing, it was what I hope to be honest. - Mon Nov 16 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: And you gave me something no one has ever been able to give me, I've never felt like -that-. - Mon Nov 16 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) reached over under the table and gripped his hand in her own gently.* - Mon Nov 16 14:21:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) had been looking to him already while holding his hand under the table. When he said those words her index finger twitched and she had to divert her eyes downwards.* - Mon Nov 16 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: How can you ...love me so fast? - Mon Nov 16 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..The pace that I started to love you.. is fast.. - Mon Nov 16 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I can't give you a set answer to that.. - Mon Nov 16 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: But I do know what I'm feeling. - Mon Nov 16 14:26:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) twitched her lips a bit and released his hands and then went over to the waiter and whispered to him and slipped him enough cash for him and the cook. The waiter nodded and then went to the door and put up the closed sign before him and the cook went out for a smoke. She went back over and sat down before picking up a piece of the eggs off the plate with her chopsticks and held it up to his mouth.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled gently and then looked him over and leaned in to kiss him on the corner of the lips while he was chewing. To some it was too friendly, to others romantic. She went back to eating and drinking her coffee all the same.* - Mon Nov 16 15:16:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled and looked him over, "I feel like you enjoy knowing my name a little too much. Does it not upset you that you only found out when I wrote it on the contract?"* - Mon Nov 16 15:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) notes she looked casual as fuck, she had on black sneakers, dark grey sweat pants, a plain black t-shirt and a black hoodie that was open. She had all her piercings out, no make-up, and her hair was extremely curly compared to how anyone had seen it before and in a wild mane that was sort of that 'black sexy girl lookin' straight out of bed' look. Course she wasn't black, she was some mixture of asain, but maybe she did have a little something else mixed in to give her that curly hair? When he asked about them getting their stuff handled she nodded like a student who had let her mentor down. "Yeah...."* - Tue Nov 17 02:28:54 2015
