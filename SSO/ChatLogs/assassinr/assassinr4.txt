<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright then.. - Tue Nov 17 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked between the two and remained silent as they spoke. Her hands tucked away into her pockets of her sweatpants and she stared up at the sky soon after, it was a pretty cool day, she was glad she didn't wear a skirt.* - Tue Nov 17 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Sensei, you wanted me to learn that genjutsu diffusion thing right? - Tue Nov 17 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded her head towards Ortho, "Yes, I'm ready, Sir. I haven't really looked into it." She didn't really know hardly anything about Genjutsu.* - Tue Nov 17 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was watching him intently, after all she had been in trouble with him recently... She watched the handseal and heard his warning about passing out. She swallowed hard at the chance of dying but surely Ortho would release her chakra if it got close to that. His explanation of giving herself an anxiety attack was kind of... going to be hard to tell, after all she was currently having a real anxiety attack in the back of her mind but was all too good at hiding it currently. 

Nodding towards him she formed the handseal and closed her eyes as she concentrated on shutting down her chakra points one by one but only managed to get half way before gasping for breath and reaching up to run both her hands through her hair with a slight pull at the roots.* - Tue Nov 17 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) began to try and control her chakra network again, but this time instead of the points she focused on the flowing between the points. She felt it flowing through her and tried to determine the right moment to turn it off. All of this would only be possible for someone who was in utter control of their feelings and their mental state but Eri was far from relaxed and concentrated. Opening her eyes to look at Ortho she shook her head, "No... I can't do this now." Her formality gone for the moment as she looked at him and then sighed heavily and started to walk off to the South to catch some air outside the walls. She wanted to be alone...* - Tue Nov 17 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked back at the guitar being offered she looked towards it and then twitched her lips and took the guitar. She slung it over her shoulder and nodded to his request. She nodded her head in passing towards Ortho without turning about and headed out of the settlement to get some quiet alone with the guitar.* - Tue Nov 17 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) made her way out into the middle of the forest, the tree's is where she found her best solitude to focus her mind and relax when she was tense. With the guitar slung over her shoulder she walked across pine needles blanketing the forest floor until she found a good spot to rest and play Hatsujin's instrument. She was lucky he was kind enough to let her borrow it, considering how special it was to him. Tucking herself up against the trunk of a tree she shifted the guitar strap over her head so it was diagonal and then plucked a few of the strings. 

Eri sat there in her casual sweatpants, t-shirt and hoodie, no make-up, no piercings, her hair curly as all hell in a mane of messiness. She felt very plain but that was okay for once, she didn't need to be special, she didn't need to stand out. Eri was just ... Eri. She plucked the strings a few more times and played a small string of notes before leaning her head back against the trunk and cycling through the same three notes in a mournful E flat major chord. The sorrowful cord echoed throughout the wooded area around her while Eri felt her heart thumping harder and harder with each strum.

<After all of that last night, this morning... and here I am sitting out in the middle of no where by myself conflicted on what to do. I didn't bring up about the possibility of -that- this morning at breakfast but what if I should have?> A heavy sigh sounded as she paused the chord and tried to focus before switching to C sharp/D flat chord. <I have come so far, done terrible things and gotten over them like they were nothing but all it took was one little phrase from Ortho to turn me into something I've been trying to stay away from.>

Her eyes opened as the dark pupils peered out into the afternoon dim lighting beneath the tree's, her song continued and shifted back to E flat once more. <I'm a monster in my eyes now, I told myself I would never walk down this path and here I am staring at myself through my own mind and I have turned into a monster just like the rest of them. I was so different for so long and now I became a monster just like the rest. I dared to tread into waters I couldn't handle and let him gain emotions for me...those emotions only sprung emotions inside of me and can I really trust that he means it? That he loves me? He hardly knows me even. I'm scared he actually might get my love in return but it's far too quickly for me to love anyone again after my parents.> 

She stopped playing and pulled the guitar off to rest it against the ground with face up towards the sky. She leaned over and placed her forearms on her knee's and face in her palms as the thoughts persisted. <I loved them so much and then they had to go and... be who they were, they were worse than monsters, but I can feel it wearing off on me. Even as I don't feel enough to care while dead bodies lay around me I'm starting to love again, starting to find my path and it's not the one that I had expected to follow. Why do I have to be so torn between the two routes? Why do I have to look at Ortho and all I see is  Sensei who loves me.. who might end up being with me till the end, who loves me... who I could love... who I might be pregnant with his child right now?---No... don't think about that>

She shook her head and dug her fingers into her scalp, <Now that it's here I can't help it, my path is on the route of motherhood if I'm not careful, even if I'm not pregnant it's going to have possibilities of that with Ortho. I can tell he wants kids in the future, maybe not now but is that really the route I want to take? Or should I continue on this emotionless path of killing when it suites the situation and telling everyone else 'no' when they try to approach me. I was so determined, but is Ortho really detering that determination?> 

Eri rose her head and peered about the forest with tears already forming in her eyes, she could see the world through wax paper it seemed and it would be clearer to her than it is right now. All she could know previously was that she wanted Ortho to be -some- part of her life but she was having difficulty determining which part. A Sensei? A lover? A husband? Swallowing hard as fresh hot tears flowed down her cheeks she then spoke out loud in a soft hushed voice, "I know what I want... I'm letting all their stupid opinions cloud my judgement. I want Ortho, not as one of those options but as all of them, at least eventually on some. He is my Sensei, he is my lover... and one day he -will- be more. He might just be my family now but that is enough to keep us bonded for eternity even if me and him are the only ones in the world to ever know that we have love for each other. If we have to keep it a secret till the ends of the earth to protect each other, and possibly our children... that is what we will do."

She could feel the heat growing in her cheeks as they tinted pink in a flush from her emotions and everything started to become clear simply from those words being spoken aloud. "My path is decided and it will not change, it already was set forth but I don't care if I'm a monster, I'll do whatever it takes to protect my family, whatever it takes to protect Ortho... to make the bond stronger and kill or maim or torture whoever it's necessary to harm in order to keep us safe and untouched. I will burn the gates of Kirigakure if needed to the ground in order to make him and the rest of our family safe and happy and I -won't- die trying, I'll flourish. I'll make certain that no one stops me and if death tries to knock on my door I'll laugh in it's doomed visage, nothing will hold me down in my resolve to follow my path. I have accepted what I must do for mine, and my families, happiness."

Her glare had become so intense upon the wooded forest before her, Eri hadn't even realized she activated her family's heritage during her grief stricken epiphany. Staring out into the sun streaked autumn afternoon with blood red pools dripped in black tears that came to swirl about the dark refuge of her pupil.* - Tue Nov 17 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) came back with the guitar over her shoulder and walked over towards Hatsu to hand it over to him. If he was asleep she would simply lay the instrument next to him before walking over towards Ortho and looking up to him with determination. "I can continue now if you'd like, Sir. Though if you'd be willing... I'd like to discuss what I can do for your efforts in keeping the settlement secure and eliminating the threat Kirigakure holds." her voice had become stern and to the point on this matter and clearly she wasn't joking.* - Tue Nov 17 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'ma just creep away on that note. - Tue Nov 17 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stared up at him with an aware gaze. She nodded about the front lines being a suicide mission, "I wasn't asking for the front lines, I know that I'm not prepared for that yet. There has to be something else I can do to help other than train under you. I'm putting myself out there to help because maybe you don't see it but I can be a great help, and maybe in your eyes or everyoe elses I'm still just a young girl but I know that I have potential already unlocked and ready to use. Your teachings helped get me there and there has to be something that I'm capable of that can give you an edge no one else can provide. You said it yourself I am another copy of you, I don't see it all the time but I see some aspects where we are similar but I also see some things in me that make me valuable in different ways than you are." 

She paused and lowered her gaze towards the ground, "if you feel that I can't overcome the hardship or stereotype that I am being labeled as...then test me, I will prove not only to you but to myself that I am ready. And if I'm not? Then I will do as you say and train under youto prepare myself. I'm tired of being looked at like a breakable little princess to sit inside these walls and shadow you constantly. I hear the whispers all the time, 'that mysterious girl who follows you around'. I understand it's necessary to shadow you, I'm your student but I want to be able to walk past them like I did when I walked back inside this gate today. I didn't care how they looked at me this go around. Their whispers, their glances, their jeers... I know who I am and that's to be by your side in the effort to call this settlement home... to -make- it our home, Sir."* - Tue Nov 17 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) listened to everything he said but specifically that last sentence stuck with her definitively. "I couldn't agree more, Sir," a wide smile began to pull at her lips as she smiled for the first time in public since before their arguement. She knew now her faults of the past and what she needed to do, it was extremely clear.* - Tue Nov 17 06:06:30 2015

"Today sucks... started out weird, had a few good parts there in the beginning even if it was weird but then this happens and you turn into this... you are so much better than this, Ortho." She still had her arm wrapped around his shoulders unless he had pulled away when she smacked him upside the head. "Are you going to calm down now? I understand your sister is dead and you can't go to her but maybe there is a way to get her body to you? Maybe we can work something out... I don't know but we can probably figure something out. You can't get her back now, she's gone... so you just gotta figure out how to momve on from it."* - Tue Nov 17 11:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Let's not get into that.. - Tue Nov 17 11:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...alright. - Tue Nov 17 11:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: How bad did I screw.. 'us'.. up? - Tue Nov 17 11:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked up to him with a sake bottle in her grip and her other arm around his shoulders. "Not at all."* - Tue Nov 17 11:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right.. - Tue Nov 17 11:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm not lying. - Tue Nov 17 11:54:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Hey. - Tue Nov 17 11:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I... - Tue Nov 17 11:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) leaned in against his forehead and whispered with her lips nearly pressed against his, "You want to get drunk and high and have sex?"* - Tue Nov 17 11:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her lip hard at him reminding her of the rule and that dead pan voice. "You don't happen to have snacks in there too do you?" She moved her arm off of his shoulders and sat down the bottle of sake to start stripping off clothing. She removed the hoodie, the t-shirt, the sweatpants, shoes, socks, and then finally removed her panties and bra. She couldn't look more natural and it made her feel -really- naked becuase of how she wasn't wearing piercings, her hair wasn't fixed, and no make-up. She flushed faintly before sitting back down beside him and trying to tuck under his arm with her legs pulled up onto the couch to the side with her knee's and part of her legs atop his closest thigh.

"I got a question for you, does my hair and ... uh like, all of this bother you?" She waved her hand in a circle to signify her face and hair.* - Tue Nov 17 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) reached out for her bottle of sake again and took a sip, "are we going to play our game again or do you just want to chill tonight? Doesn't look like we are going to be training unless you really feel up to it." She could feel his cock against her leg but it didn't bother her for now, she actually kind of liked how it was laying against her all casual like. Her nipples were more certainly not hard though, it was not cold in the house to her at all. * - Tue Nov 17 12:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) blinked a few times at what he said, "let's take it slow whichever way we go, we always jump in so fast... except when we were in the shower... that was nice and slow starting... it's up to you. Do what you want, mkay? Do what you like, Ortho. I'll play along."* - Tue Nov 17 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) swallowed hard as he started to adjust her atop his lap so that she was a little bit in front of her and she could feel his cock pressed along her ass crack with her one leg rose up so that her pussy was spread to the cool air while resting her back against his chest. "Sounds good, so casual then?" His voice didn't sound stern at all so she took another drink of the sake and wondered when he might want to start smoking.* - Tue Nov 17 12:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) squinted at his comments and lifted her head to bite the underside of his jaw gently before reaching out to take her own blunt and lighting it up. She gave a few puffs while the lighter was switched on to get the coal going and then snapped the lighter shut and sat it back on the tray. She wiggled her hips with a sublte, "Hmnn..." sound as she settled in to relax, of course that meant grinding against his dick a small amount. She was totally okay with this set up currently, it was nice.* - Tue Nov 17 12:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes and then looked up at him, "OooooOoOoo doctor.~" She had totally forgotten about that roleplay and suddenly that became -much- more interesting than casual toking night. "Is that the game you want to play? Hm?~ Or are we going to stay casual? You -did- say you wanted casual.~" She toked heavily from the blunt ignoring his previous comment.* - Tue Nov 17 13:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) inhaled stiffly and started to choke on the smoke she had just inhaled a few seconds before. "Nngn...fuck," Eri tried to concentrate on getting her breath back but he was distracting her fairly easily. "I don't think that's appropriate doctor behavior. Does that mean you are going to give me my check up now or wait till our next business meeting?" While he was still at it with his fingers she casually leaned forward to grip the edge of the nearest sake bottle for a drink to clear her throat from the burning ache she had just caused herself.* - Tue Nov 17 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gasped out and gripped the coffee table with her blunt teetering in her grip and her sake bottle clanking against the table. "P-pretty sure that isn't how you do check ups, Doc. S-shiiiiit.." She closed her eyes for a moment and let out a small growl as she tried to hold it together after the shocking entry.* - Tue Nov 17 13:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) snarled her lip up to expose her teeth to him as her head rotated and she shifted it back down soon after to plant her forehead against the coffee table. "N-no no... the other way was just... 'peachy'!" She grumbled soft curses while she could hardly hold onto the blunt in her hand by now as it bounced up and down shaking. "Though you aren't assuring your patient's comfortability very much... maybe I should find a new doctor."* - Tue Nov 17 13:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Don't think I like this as much as the business meetings. - Tue Nov 17 14:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Or the Sensei lessons.... - Tue Nov 17 14:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gasped out as her lips brushed against the coffee table and she nearly crumpled the blunt in her fingers up from squeezing it so tightly but resisted enough to keep it from fully falling apart. "R-right, will do... Nng..." After a few moments of recovering after he had fully pulled out she sat up and leaned her head back against his shoulder while she panted out and could feel lines of her fluids running down the bottom curve of her ass cheeks from the position she was in. "S-soooooo.... c-casual night?" She tried to open her eyes to look up at him and chuckled almost desperately to keep things light.* - Tue Nov 17 14:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes and gave a low hum of satisfaction from feeling his manhood shift forward against her cleft. Taking in her own toke she blew the smoke soon after up into the air above them. "So I sort of have to admit I never did go learn that Kai jutsu thing you tossed me, I went and played guitar with Hatsu instead. He didn't believe I could play so I had to prove a point."* - Tue Nov 17 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah...I was mostly just out for the fresh air... - Tue Nov 17 16:36:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Are you going to keep silent? - Tue Nov 17 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) glanced up towards Kana and then stepped to the side so she wasn't directly next to Minatabi, whoever he was.* - Tue Nov 17 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Nah. - Tue Nov 17 17:52:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wasn't about to cause trouble but she was pretty confident Kana was going to get herself into some shit later with Ortho for behaving this way towards her. All Eri wanted was some damn sushi...* - Tue Nov 17 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Tell your boyfriend to stop his shit also. - Tue Nov 17 18:03:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled faintly, "till I see you again, Razuberi-chan." A small comment on the color of Kana's hair color, and her attitude. She continued on her way to leave unless stopped once more.* - Tue Nov 17 18:13:32 2015
