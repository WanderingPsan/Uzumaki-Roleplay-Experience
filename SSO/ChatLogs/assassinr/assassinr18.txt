<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Sure. - Tue Dec  1 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: This should be good enough. - Tue Dec  1 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) began to weave her hands into seals, she had to -intentionally- lower her speed of the handseals so that he could learn them while she went though them. "This is Kumonendo. You seek out the chakra in your belly and then form it into a thin string and pull it from your reserves of our family secret chaka point. She then gathered the chakra and spat out the web towards a tree branch and gripped the webs and tugged hard. He would notice if he touched the webs they were as hard as steel, and to him they wouldn't be sticky at all because he was of the family heritage.* - Tue Dec  1 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) watched his attempt, "You are a natural, usually this takes people like... twenty to fifty tries. You must have really good control to manage that." She shifted off to the side so she wouldn't get hit and expected him to try again.* - Tue Dec  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) smiled faintly as he managed to achieve what to do. "Good job, want to learn another? Or did that tire you out?"* - Tue Dec  1 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I can handle another... - Tue Dec  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Alright. - Tue Dec  1 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) nodded, "This one is a lot easier in form but you need to be able to control your chakra fast and spit quickly so that you can make it work.. or else it's just really slow and not as effective." She formed handseals and then quickly shot out little tiny webs and they hit several small targets across the area. She then spit one into her hand so he could see what it looked like and how tiny it was, no bigger than a male's hand.* - Tue Dec  1 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh right, it's called Kumo Soka. - Tue Dec  1 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow at him being tired, being able to tell he probably wasn't that good with chakra reserves regardless of his control. "Yeah, probably a good idea."* - Tue Dec  1 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) watched him as he formed the barrier She rose her brow and then shifted a bit, "Wow no handseals? That's bad ass..." muttered out semi-jealously. She then channeled chakra through her body and into the focal point of her genetics and then spat out the golden stuff but it turned into a pool before hardening into what looked more like an ice rink. "Shit...." grumbled as she realized that she was going to have to get it to harden faster if it was going to form a barrier.

She focused more of her chakra through the gooey golden material and then spat it out again, this time it easily formed a small barrier in front of her that looked good for combat uses for cover and a vantage point. "Eh, not terrible, I'll work on it. Is there any other use for this besides a wall?"* - Tue Dec  1 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It can be used as a shield or a second layer of skin as well. - Tue Dec  1 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's good when you need a quick defense. - Tue Dec  1 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: That second skin thing is pretty bad ass. - Tue Dec  1 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Does it limit your movement though? - Tue Dec  1 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. - Tue Dec  1 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Niiiiice. - Tue Dec  1 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You got something else for me? - Tue Dec  1 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hm. - Tue Dec  1 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Here, I'll teach you how to make those spears I use. - Tue Dec  1 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: That's ...gross. - Tue Dec  1 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Somewhat. - Tue Dec  1 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) wrinkled her nose up at what he had done but understood it's practicality. She began to sweat out chakra through her pores heavily through her right arm and hand and soon enough a small spear was formed. ---- By that I mean a kunai sized little blunt weapon. "Maybe I can just bluggeon them to death?" She mockingly swung it to the air like she was beating someone to shit across the head. "Eh.."

She began to flow chakra out through her arm and hand again and then flowed more and more chakra until it was an enlarged baton but wasn't sharp. She tried to flow more chakra into it to mold the shape and eventually it became sharper and sharper as she held onto it with a trembling hand as she tried to focus her control and chakra all into the spear. By now she was really sweating and it was obvious she was running on low.* - Tue Dec  1 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Don't strain yourself now... - Tue Dec  1 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That's good so far though, just work on it some. - Tue Dec  1 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn, yeah... Okay. - Tue Dec  1 03:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Sure. - Tue Dec  1 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) tossed the spear and then prepared to walk back to the village.* - Tue Dec  1 03:38:52 2015

Late you came out of the room with her, when we played the dice game she quickly stopped me fom taking you into the room with me and it wasn't because she wanted to sleep with me. - Tue Dec  1 05:30:40 2015
