<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: This is why I'm happy I took anger management. - Tue Nov 24 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stood with her upper body leaning against the cliffside. She had a heavy long jacket wth fur on the inside and suade on the outside wrapped tightly about her body in black and grey with the hood up over he head so that only her face was showing. She had a thin cigar between her lips with the tobacco leave wrapped firmly about the dark green gound up leaves inside. Pulling a lighter fom her pocket she lit the end to get a coal started and took a few puffs. Snapping the lighter shut and dropping it back into her pocket, she reached up to the blunt with two fingers and pulled it away to exhale some of the smoke. An aromatic scent filled the chilly air as it was obvious she wasn't smoking tobacco.* - Tue Nov 24 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why are there so many people who don't know the glory of bud? - Tue Nov 24 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Hm...Him as well. - Tue Nov 24 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) turned her head with the fur jacket lining he face. She brought the blunt to her lips again and took another toke, "It's weed, you never smelt weed before?" She then spotted the signature bandages about the head Ortho and his messy hair. She nearly dropped the blunt as her jaw dropped, gripping onto the blunt tightly but then turning to snuff it out against the cliff side and gripping it in her palm she started to run full force towards Ortho. Anything that was going on before that was forgotten as she focused on just making sure that Ortho was real and not a hallucination.* - Tue Nov 24 14:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: It seems I won't have to sick my ultimate weapon on Ortho after all. - Tue Nov 24 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hello. - Tue Nov 24 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hello. - Tue Nov 24 15:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You wanted to speak to me in private? - Tue Nov 24 15:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yes. - Tue Nov 24 15:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Let's go to my manor. - Tue Nov 24 15:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) appoached him and aimed to wrap her arms around the back of his neck as she could smell the bad scent of thick alcohol and weed. She wrinkled her nose a bit and then looked up to him. "Why didn't you come find me as soon as you got here? I been so worried about you... ngng.. Why you gotta be like that, huh?" She was speaking low in a hushed voice with the cold clearly taking a toll on her voice box as it made her voice a bit scratchy, not to mention the smoking in the cold. "You gonna be alright? Did you do the plan?"* - Tue Nov 24 15:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) listened to what he said but she didn't feel he needed to say sorry. She hugged him tighter regardless of his smell and then kissed him even. "You don't need to say sorry, you did what you thought was right. Regardless, this means he will come release me....right?" She wasn't so sure but she was trying to be...positive.* - Tue Nov 24 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rubbed her lips together, "yeah.... he'll come to us and he'll release me." She knew that she was lying to herself, she wasn't going to get out of this seal...not if Edge was the one to undo it. Course maybe he would undo it but then put on a new one.... maybe her destiny now was to just remain a burden to Ortho and held over his head as a weapon against him by Edge.* - Tue Nov 24 16:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was lifted easily enough and widened her eyes some as she peered around Ortho towards Kana. She thought their issues were resolved? "Eh? I thought things were chill now between you two?" She tucked her blunt that was cold now into her pocket and looked over towards Kana.* - Tue Nov 24 16:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Too early. - Tue Nov 24 16:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) could see they probably needed some alone time. She scooched out behind Ortho and started to walk over towards Ichiro while pulling her blunt back out and lighting it as she walked. After all, she couldn't do SHIT if Kana decided to fuck with Ortho, she was like a lovable little kitten right now... with baby teeth and claws.* - Tue Nov 24 16:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: no - Tue Nov 24 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: I should go train... - Tue Nov 24 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Push myself even further...I can feel the third boundary... - Tue Nov 24 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: I heard sexual pleasures can assist in bypassing them. - Tue Nov 24 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) continued towards Ichiro since Kana was taking forever to rp. She leaned up against the cliff beside him and toked a few more inhales. "So who'r you?"* - Tue Nov 24 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Engi. - Tue Nov 24 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded slowly to him and gave her surname like she did for everyone, "Supaiku." She held out her free hand towards him for a shake, it was obvious she had no weapons on her hand but she did have a sleeve so perhaps it was something to be warry of.* - Tue Nov 24 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow as he bowed gently, she took a moment to analyze such action and then questioned. "Are you from Amegakure?"* - Tue Nov 24 17:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) lowered her hand to her pocket and took a few more puffs as she glanced over towards Kana and Ortho for a moment but focused back onto Ichiro. "Hm.. I figured you might have been from there originally, your custom seemed like you were." She didn't state which custom and left it at that. "You were curious about my blunt? Did you want some?"* - Tue Nov 24 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No, I don't smoke. I just wanted to know what gave off that aroma. - Tue Nov 24 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn. - Tue Nov 24 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You a shinobi of this village then? - Tue Nov 24 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. I'm a traveller. - Tue Nov 24 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Ah. - Tue Nov 24 17:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: What about you? Is this your village? - Tue Nov 24 17:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn no. - Tue Nov 24 17:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm with Ortho. - Tue Nov 24 17:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Previously from Konoha. - Tue Nov 24 17:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) brought her sleeve up so he could see the metal and cloth gauntlet with Konoha's insignia.* - Tue Nov 24 17:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I see. - Tue Nov 24 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I visited there once but it rather...quiet. - Tue Nov 24 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: It's dead. - Tue Nov 24 17:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Seems to be the fate of all of the villages these days. - Tue Nov 24 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Or always has been. - Tue Nov 24 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Mhm. - Tue Nov 24 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) toked a few times more, "So whatcha doing here then?"* - Tue Nov 24 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's the only village that'll allow me to stay a while. - Tue Nov 24 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) turned in against the cliff and held her hands up over her head. It seemed she had no shinobi tactic of defending herself so it was good that Ichiro had formed the barrier. She panted heavily and then her eyes widened as she muttered, "Ortho..." Teeth grit and she tried to see over the barrier after the water had passed to his location.* - Tue Nov 24 17:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) spotted Eiyu as she finished smoking her blunt and snuffed it out. "Hey-o Eiyu-kun, want to get some sake?"* - Tue Nov 24 17:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Sake would be nice. - Tue Nov 24 17:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: If you have business I can leave ya be. - Tue Nov 24 17:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I suppose I will be very busy shortly.. I wonder what will happen... - Tue Nov 24 17:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: Why is the Mizukage attempting to speak to me now? - Tue Nov 24 17:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Do you want me to join you maybe? - Tue Nov 24 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) figured that was probably inappropriate but offered anyway.* - Tue Nov 24 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Tue Nov 24 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I wont be leaving Kumogakure... It'll probably just .. - Tue Nov 24 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Have our troops on high alert for a period of time. - Tue Nov 24 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn, you wanna talk about it over sake? - Tue Nov 24 18:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: This no training bit sucks. - Tue Nov 24 18:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Guess it doesn't matter though, who needs to train when you are gonna die? - Tue Nov 24 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shrugged, "well maybe I can drink and you have a tea... while you take care of business. We can bring it back to the mansion if it makes you feel better." She kicked off from the cliff and adjusted her black and grey jacket with fur keeping her warm. "Le's gooooooooooooo!" She had yet to inform Eiyu of her current situation, perhaps Ortho had, but regardless... her behavior would be different than normal. More free spirited.* - Tue Nov 24 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I can tell something is off... - Tue Nov 24 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'm concerned. - Tue Nov 24 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sat down across from him and ordered three bottles of sake. "Hah... I uh... I'm suppose to die today... could be any minute... Ortho is off in his shame, and Edge hasn't shown up." She started to drink down a few hard swallows of the hot sake.* - Tue Nov 24 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shrugged and drank some more as she gasped and scowled from the bitterness. "Edge sealed me with a curse, I cant use any chakra so I'm helpless and it was destined to kill me in ten days if he didn't remove it. He hasn't shown so I'm going to die. Even though Otho did what he demanded." She felt his large hand on her shoulder and she simply seemed to accept what her fate was.* - Tue Nov 24 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) whispers: You can't give up.. Must I remind of the child in your stomach? - Tue Nov 24 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head and then tears cascaded down her cheeks as he mentioned the child. "I'm not pregnant."* - Tue Nov 24 18:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: It was a type of fuuinjutsu... Ortho couldn't read it. - Tue Nov 24 18:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) undid her jacket and then pulled up her shirt to show the seal on her belly. "Do you understand it? Ortho couldn't..."* - Tue Nov 24 18:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sighed out and pulled her shirt back down, "The seal is destined to kill me today." She wiped her tears and then picked up the sake again and began to drink. "I don't think Sunagakure will aid me... at all."* - Tue Nov 24 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I think they will.. Provided we give them proper incentive... - Tue Nov 24 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: Sadly, she cannot even Henge.... - Tue Nov 24 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: I'll think of something.... - Tue Nov 24 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I can't even -travel- to Suna in time... - Tue Nov 24 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Why . . . Did you not tell me sooner? - Tue Nov 24 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You were busy.... - Tue Nov 24 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I tried to tell you when I arrived three days ago. - Tue Nov 24 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I wasn't busy! - Tue Nov 24 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) jumped some and looked away as she dropped her bottle of sake and it spilled.* - Tue Nov 24 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'm sorry...... - Tue Nov 24 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head, "if he does come... don't fight him... he will just hurt me or someone else again. He's determined to use Ortho as a tool." * - Tue Nov 24 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sighed out and closed her eyes, "Eiyu.... he doesn't trust him. Edge saw right through Ortho's disguise of emotions. All it took was me standing beside Ortho for him to realize his feelings and targetted me. He disabled Ortho with a simple snap of his fingers and then sealed me and demanded he do what he wanted if he wanted me to live. Now he has gone back on his word, or he is trying to make Ortho sweat... I'm uncertain which."* - Tue Nov 24 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head in a solumn manner and started to drink from the second bottle. "Please just leave it Eiyu-kun....really... if I am to die, I will die. If I am to live, then I will live. The only thing that holds me captive is fate, no man can take my freedom. I am still free, because I live."* - Tue Nov 24 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) listened to his words and took another drink as she watched the look in his eye. When he pulled her in in by the collar she pressed her forehead against his and looked deeply into his eyes with her own. "Eiyu-kun... you really should be more careful who you bring so close like this. If I didn't know better, I would think you are coming on to me.~" To her, this particular position of staring into the eyes, forehead to forehead, was very romantic. It even made her cheeks flush faintly for doing it with someone other than Ortho. "As long as you don't try to throw your life away for mine, then I will accept your help."* - Tue Nov 24 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) chuckled lightly, "I am only teasing...though that was slightly romantic.~ I won't fib, I don't kiss and tell." She drank a few more gulps of sake and stared over to him. She was clearly trying to make light of the situation. "No, I do not... but I would like to find him."* - Tue Nov 24 19:10:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sighed out heavily and drank a few heavy drinks from her sake bottle. She figured after the two bottle she has currently she should probably stop, that'd give her a nice buzz to start the day she was destined to die. Her mind traveled off to the various places she had visited and a subtle smile tugged at her lips. Funny that she couldn't enjoy this world on her last day through the lens she wished to see it through. Her heart wished for just one last look through those eyes but knew it was best to not linger on that thought too thoroughly.

She took another long sip and wondered if she should smoke another blunt but that would probably be foolish. If things did get messy here she wanted to be coherent. Plus, you only die once right? She wanted to feel the full experience. Her mind wandered off and it looked like she was out of it, zoning into her thoughts, as she wondered what type of death the curse might bring her. Would it be painful? Terrifying? Or perhaps peaceful and she would just drop like a hat...* - Tue Nov 24 19:46:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) had been pretty much watching Ortho and Edge. What Rymei and Kana were doing was ignored essentially but the light catching the feathers up above her head made her look up. She wasn't sure what it was but feathers falling from the fucking -sky- clearly was some sort of jutsu and nothing normal to behold. She darted back immediately to gain some distance before they landed. Honestly she assumed that they were some sort of blade that had a trick of the eye going on, she wasn't aware it was a genjutsu in the least.* - Tue Nov 24 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) thinks: Did she.... - Tue Nov 24 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes dilated as she saw the sight before her. She couldn't step forward or would be walking into the trap of the feathers. She could see Ortho and the trouble was in but let's face it, Eri couldn't do anything right now. She knew her chances at the moment of survival and as she stepped in a small pace back and forth while facing the enemy, the girl couldn't bring herself to try and go forward. Her body stood still simply because she wasn't an utter idiot. Perhaps this is what was meant to happen, regardless it was unfair. Her eyes burned as she watched what was likely either going to be Ortho's demise or both Ortho and Edge...but surely not Edge alone.

She doubted her life would be spared, and that was the last thing on her mind. She already had decided that she was to accept death when it came to her. She remained standing with hatred building inside of her. Her eyes bore holes into Edge's skull as she watched him quickly aiming to strip her husband from this world. She felt faint but remained standing as her body trembled not in fear but utter rage and hate for the man before her. Even before Ortho's life had been stripped from this world, she was already making an oath to herself to assure Edge's demise in her future... But this was so cliche, everyone hated Edge, it feels so overdone. So probably she will learn to move past it and just take her hate out on everyone else around her. 

Regardless, Eri remained at the edge of the genjutsu staring in and watching her husband's fate. What else was she to do in her current state? Honestly.* - Tue Nov 24 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes at what Edge was saying, it was almost like it was fucking -calling out- to her. What she had tried to get him to listen to earlier was calling for her to act. To shout it if she needed to, just to get Edge to listen. Likely she wasn't going to be fast enough to speak before the senbon was shot but perhaps Edge would hesitate... or you no, maybe not. 

She rushed forward but wasn't getting too close to Rymei and Edge so she didn't -really- look like a threat. She stopped soon after she had moved forward but her words had begun just as her feet picked off to dart forward with her will pushing her to speak out against the current actions, since she couldn't fight them.

"Wait!! Don't take his life, let him live. Take my life in his place, I've heard of you being a God among men, I believed it since you showed up here the first time. I knew his noble attitude and attempts to resist what you wanted were futile but you wouldn't hear me out before, then hear me now! Take my life, use Ortho as a puppet if you'd like to do your will from here on out but let him live! He is worth too much for you to snuff it out here and now preemptively! Think of what you could make him into? What you could use him for against Sunagakure to restore the future you want for Sunagakure! Think about how you could change the world and bend it to your will as Ortho as your pawn?! If you want to prove a point then take my life and hold it hostage!" She stepped closer as she screamed out her words filled with rage and passion. 

"You are a God, and I don't doubt you are a god that can control life and death! Take my life now and oath for him to have my life returned when he is completed. Or don't give my life back, I don't care anymore. I've accepted my fate and if the God before me decides that death is what I should accept then I will have it! Just don't take his, Ortho's life is too precious to the progression of a new world I know you seek to control!" By now she had fallen to her knees on the pathway with her eyes staring up at Edge and her chest heaving up and down with a pant from the emotion and shouting she had just displayed. Regardless of what happened, she had stated her all for what she had to offer. Giving her soul and body was a hefty price to save Ortho with the -chance- that he might be useful to Edge, but it was all she had to give.* - Tue Nov 24 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) seeing that the fight hadn't paused for a moment about half way through what she was stating before she had fallen to the ground, Eri rushed forward again and pulled from her side holster a simple kunai. It was the only thing she really had to use against Edge currently since she couldn't use any chakra at all. With a simple movement of her hand she attempted to slice a single time across his neck similiarly to how Ortho had attempted only a few moments before and then tried to plunge the kunai deep into Edge's eye socket and twist. Hoping that this might go deep enough into his skull to cause brain damage and hopefully kill him if the slice to his throat wasn't already doing so. * - Tue Nov 24 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes widened and she froze as her body hitched back as the chakra receivers dug into her chest and carved out flesh, bone, and what have you. Her hand around the kunai laxed and it dropped from her grip as she fell to her knee's staring out with nothing in focus. All she could hear was Ortho's last words as her eyes watered and tears began to fall. She could hear the way his voice had life in it but was quickly being snuffed out, her body felt numb from the shock and her mind only could focus on him as her heart ached for the person she was about to loose. Her own life didn't matter if it meant losing him and she knew that it was very likely her life was about to end in a few short moments. 

She spoke out in a trembling voice in response to Ortho, "All in, Sensei..." her tears falling down her cheeks heavier than ever as she stumbled back and caught herself with one palm spread out and then her arm buckled as she coughed hard and could feel her chest aching. The wave of shock had gone past and now she could feel the intense pressure and burn upon her upper body like a stinging weight. She could tell that things were about to end for her, all the prospects that they had lined up for their future... children, a large family with the Uchiha. She shifted her head over and looked towards Ortho as his light was going out. Eri reached a shakey hand over towards his laying on the grass, coated in blood and tried to hold onto his hand weakly. Staring at the kanji tattoo'd about her finger and on his own while struggling to even see through the tears. * - Tue Nov 24 23:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Let's see what six areas they want to be joined at. - Tue Nov 24 23:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was watching Ortho's dead visage when Edge gripped her hand. She didn't resist, she had no reason to any longer. It wasn't that she -wanted- death, it was just that she accepted this was her time. She screamed out in anquish as the rod went through her hand to secure it to Ortho's own. She stared at the tattoo's and then felt her arm drop heavy as he gripped her waist and stabbed through her back. The screaming hitched and then continued as her lower body paralyzed and the rod through her lower torso did damage to her organs and started to shut them down.

Her eyes continued focused on Ortho as he continued through the rods but soon enough she died before he even could reach stabbing them through the heart. Her small frame couldn't take the pain of the chakra receivers breaking down her strength and in actuality causing internal bleeding far to severe for her to cope with. Her lifeless body lay on the grass, soaked in blood as she was left connected to Ortho to the end. Like she told Ortho in the past, even in death they would always be together.* - Tue Nov 24 23:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) didn't care that he stared at her, she continued to chew her bubble gum and blow bubbles as her main set of arms was tucked away into her hoodie, along with her third set. While the middle set was folded back behind her body holding each other's forearms in an effort to keep them out of the way. When he spoke she tilted her head up to look out from under the hood, she looked like a rather young teen as she stared up to him with her bright red eyes with slitted black pupils. "Hellow," her sweet soft voice spoke before blowing another bubble to pop quietly.* - Wed Nov 25 17:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) knew who he was of course but she listened to his introduction all the same. She then stuck her gum under her tongue and spoke up, "I am Kariudo Engi," of course the kage probably recognized the surname. She had no shame at all in speaking her surname and relating herself to Ichiro. "What is it you want to know?" she knew he hadn't seen anyone like her, she wasn't normal and nothing about that bothered the girl. She seemed very 'matter of factly' attitude about everything.* - Wed Nov 25 17:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) unfolded the arms from behind her back and extended them out as she turned towards him. She also pulled her two other sets of arms and held them all out palm up for him to touch her arms as he pleased, as he mentioned the word 'special' it didn't bother her at all. "The word special doesn't bother me, it isn't a necessary word either. I am simply a girl with six arms. You won't make me feel bad with what you ask, it doesn't matter...ask what you please." She continued to ignore the male to her left.* - Wed Nov 25 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Ewwwwww. - Wed Nov 25 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Raikage, stop trying to get laid and give me a C rank. - Wed Nov 25 18:08:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Eiji knows I can handle it. - Wed Nov 25 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) shivered faintly from his cold hands, not to mention the cold outside from having removed her hands from her pocket. She then cocked her head to the side at him 'wondering' about her being a shinobi. "I... am a shinobi?" She pointed to the headband on her thigh since apparently he had missed it somehow. When he mentioned Eiji though she turned her head to look back to the nature loving man. She eyed him up and down and didn't get why she was being introducted to him but wasn't going to be rude to the kage's wishes.

After Eiyu seemed to focus onto Arihs she saw nothing else to do but go through with his wishes. Walking over towards Eiji she bowed her head to him lightly and the craving to chew her gum returned but she resisted. "Kirisaki-sama, it's a pleasure to meet you. I am Engi, Kariudo-san." * - Wed Nov 25 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Yooo. - Wed Nov 25 18:20:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Yooo. - Wed Nov 25 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) 's eye widened a bit as she heard him speak in such a informal way, she hadn't expected it for whatever reason due to how Eiyu had spoken so highly of him. She glanced down at his work and then back up towards his body and stance of holding the shovel. She had done her part right? Said hello... introduced herself, that should be good enough. "I won't let myself get in the way of your work, Kirisaki-sama." With a small smile she backed away from him and headed back over near Eiyu.* - Wed Nov 25 18:28:54 2015
