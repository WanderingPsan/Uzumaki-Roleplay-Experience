<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) unlocked her door before heading into the house and then locked it behind her. Beginning to pack a travel sack and only taking with her three daggers she left any other weapons behind and pulled on one of her heavy cloaks. Adjusting everything and leaving anything behind in her home that attached her to Kumogakure including any cultural clothing that could be tracked back to this village. She made sure that everything she was taking with her clothing wise or gear wise was imported into the village from other locations. Once she was packed up, the girl headed back out of her home and locked the door behind her.* - Fri Nov 27 08:22:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) walked in a casual manner across the bridge, she walked like that of a civilian honestly as she wandered around the giant bridge and peered out at the water. She looked mesmerized by her facial expression from under the shadow of the hood covering her head. With her hands all hidden away but the very tips of her fingers from the giant heavy cloak keeping her warm from the wind, not to mention hiding her extra apendages. She came to step onto the path of the island and now came to a pause as she spotted three shinobi in the road, doing who knows what. She glanced at them curiously before smiling brightly. Waving some to show she was friendly. There were no visible weapons to be seen, and honestly she didn't look to be like any kind of threat due to her height and age, then again some of the shinobi right here in front of her were children.* - Fri Nov 27 08:47:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) really didn't like what they were doing to the animal but she tried to not look too distraught. She stepped forward a bit more so she was more in the opening so the bushes didn't cover the work of the children. "Watcha doin?" She was just going to see what they were doing to the poor deer before concerning herself with her business there.* - Fri Nov 27 09:07:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) approached the area and looked over the others in the area. It was easily able to notice the kage as who he was and that was good, she at least found who she was looking for. The girl was quite short and had a young face like she was in her early teens. The hood over her head didn't cover her face at all but hair was in her face quite a bit around the sides of her face and covering her forehead, though it was obvious there was no headband being covered there. She had on a giant heavy cloak that fit her but was intentionally large to cover her entire body except the very tips of her fingers that were peaking out. It looked like a weather breaker to keep her warm and away from the harsh winds of the ocean air. Something else to be noted is that her clothing didn't stand out at all, it in fact looked like something a civilian would wear and didn't come from any particular region, most of her clothing was something you'd probably find in a Naruto-mart (walmart) at any village, big or small. 

She spotted the red head and lifted one of her hands to wave to him cheerfully as a broad friendly smile came upon her face. She took a few more steps and noticably walked like a civilian rather than how a shinobi might carry themselves, with heels scraping against the ground faintly with each step.* - Fri Nov 27 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) walked closer to the male but kept her distance, she knew how shinobi could be towards those who are strangers approaching too close. She pointed towards the Mizukage, "will he be available any time soon? I was told to come speak with him on a matter."* - Fri Nov 27 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: It's like every shinobi here is a child. - Fri Nov 27 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: This is almost too easy. - Fri Nov 27 18:41:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Ah.. okay, am I allowed to stay up here in the courtyard? - Fri Nov 27 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Like on a bench or something? - Fri Nov 27 18:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How were you let in anyway? - Fri Nov 27 18:43:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) nodded some and then walked over towards the bench but kept an eye on the child both for politeness and safety.* - Fri Nov 27 18:45:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: A little crazed. - Fri Nov 27 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ..O-oh..did they leave? - Fri Nov 27 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Crap. - Fri Nov 27 19:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: From the information I've gathered. - Fri Nov 27 19:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I think if shinobi helped me then she might find it alarming. - Fri Nov 27 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Only direction I can point you too is Sunagalure. - Fri Nov 27 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah...but my information tells me they were there before. - Fri Nov 27 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Not after I saw them. - Fri Nov 27 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: And from what she was saying I don't think she would go back there. - Fri Nov 27 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: When was that? - Fri Nov 27 19:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then they talked about finding him, and splitting up. - Fri Nov 27 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: But they ended up both going for Sunagalure. - Fri Nov 27 19:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Not Kiri, not Kumo, not Suna.... - Fri Nov 27 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Do you think I should wait to speak with the Mizukage before leaving to look elsewhere? - Fri Nov 27 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I don't know. - Fri Nov 27 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: These bouts of daydreaming can last pretty long. - Fri Nov 27 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Hm... - Fri Nov 27 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: What do you think is worth it? - Fri Nov 27 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If you're going to wait, you should occupy yourself woth something. - Fri Nov 27 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Otherwise, that trail is getting longer and longer. - Fri Nov 27 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: And it'll disappear. - Fri Nov 27 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: ... - Fri Nov 27 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) nodded slowly towards Tengoku's comment. She didn't know Nigen but Tengoku might, so perhaps she just found a lead?* - Fri Nov 27 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm so glad.. - Fri Nov 27 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Oh. - Fri Nov 27 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: He must be the priest one he spoke of, is this the man in the past with her? - Fri Nov 27 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: How does he know my name? - Fri Nov 27 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) looked to the masked man and smiled cheerfully, she wore a weather breaking cloak that covered her entire body except face, tips of hands, and point of boots. Her face was easy to see and it was obvious she was a young teen with black and red highlighted hair that covered a good portion of her face including her forehead. All of her clothing was from very generic clothing stores that could be found across any village and she even looked like a civilian for the most part by how she sat and composed herself. "Oh, hello. I'm looking for someone, maybe you know them? If you are willing to answer my questions."* - Fri Nov 27 19:55:56 2015
