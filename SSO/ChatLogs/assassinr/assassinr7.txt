<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: He seems to do that. - Fri Nov 20 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I need to speak to him about the situation at hand... Do you know when he'll be back? - Fri Nov 20 19:19:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm, do you mind if I wander around Konohagakure for a bit? I actually wanted to know what differences in our villages were. - Fri Nov 20 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm sure he will be here soon enough.... Oh... I mean... sure... do you want me to come with you? - Fri Nov 20 19:21:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Though I suppose since I'm on business... I shouldn't go out looking casual. - Fri Nov 20 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...It's better if you do. - Fri Nov 20 19:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Right... - Fri Nov 20 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Me being seen with a kage will draw attention to you and then me, they will wonder who I am. - Fri Nov 20 19:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: And I like my face, I don't want to have to change it. - Fri Nov 20 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I understand. - Fri Nov 20 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) pulled out a few coins and left them as a tip before standing and heading for the door.* - Fri Nov 20 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) remained quiet as she walked beside the man who was a giant compared to her.* - Fri Nov 20 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked up at Eiyu like he was an idiot and sighed, "Silly Eiyu-kun." * - Fri Nov 20 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Too busy staring at her tits. - Fri Nov 20 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow at him giving up so easily, clearly he liked her... Eri could see how his eyes trailed up and down her body undressing her. "We are moving on then? Alright, your call."* - Fri Nov 20 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) squinted as she looked Asteroth over, "Why do you assume we are looking for someone?"* - Fri Nov 20 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's attire was sort of feminine for her particular talents. She had on a button up dark grey shirt with studded designs, a black ruffled skirt, feminine style black combat boots, and a black leather jacket with several zipper pockets. She had several piercings along her ears, and one in the left nostril that was extremely tiny and just glinted occasionally. She had several strips of cloth tied about her wrists in several knots or designs and then on her right hand she had a cloth and metal gauntlet that was clearly more for basic protection reasons that had the Konoha insignia embedded into the metal, clearly a headband of sorts. "This isn't a ghost town... it just isn't a shinobi village at the moment," her voice sounded slightly offended by the woman's assumption.* - Fri Nov 20 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) pursed her lips, "he wasn't around to take care of his village anyhow, you shouldn't feel sorry for him, you should feel sorry for those who lost faith in their home and had to leave because of his irresponsibility." She shifted uncomfortably for a moment but then was fine again.* - Fri Nov 20 20:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) went quiet again and watched them.* - Fri Nov 20 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: He's really bad at this. - Fri Nov 20 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't introduce herself unless Asteroth spoke to her directly. She simply watched like a fly on the wall.* - Fri Nov 20 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked at the girl's hand but then nodded her head to the woman giving her only her surname which was formal to her culture. "Supaiku, Asteroth-san."* - Fri Nov 20 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Wanted to shake his hand but not mine. - Fri Nov 20 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I guess I will inform him of you coming by... - Fri Nov 20 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's lips moved as she whispered.* - Fri Nov 20 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) whispers: Thank you. - Fri Nov 20 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm. . ? Odd then. You are quite friendly. - Fri Nov 20 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I just like to express my form of empathy.. It's important to understand peoples emotions. - Fri Nov 20 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Because it makes you a better person. - Fri Nov 20 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Oi. . .So optimistic you are. It's cute, I'll admit. But foolish all the same. - Fri Nov 20 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That way of thinking leaves you susceptible to being hurt. - Fri Nov 20 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'll gladly take any form of heartache is given to me, if it helps relieve the pressure off of someone else.. - Fri Nov 20 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It's just how I am. - Fri Nov 20 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: If people actually took the time. - Fri Nov 20 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: To hear one another... - Fri Nov 20 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Maybe there wouldn't have been so much violence, and death. - Fri Nov 20 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . .Gah. You remind me of a priest. - Fri Nov 20 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....hahahhaaah. - Fri Nov 20 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) pointed a finger at Eiyu like that had been an insult.* - Fri Nov 20 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I think Priests are fairly spot on in terms of their ideology, they aren't selfish like other people, and instead work to help. - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But I haven't met a real Priest. - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Well, Niza-Sama was one. - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yukio too, but I never met him. - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) began to smile, <I like her.> She looked between the two of them and then finally spoke up. "Where are you from, if you don't mind me asking?"* - Fri Nov 20 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...Wow, compliment the lady and then insult her two seconds later. - Fri Nov 20 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Bravo. - Fri Nov 20 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Amegakure...that's good. - Fri Nov 20 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes were scanning Asteroth with a small smirk and then she nodded towards the woman as she spoke of Amegakure. "I enjoy that village, definitely one of the better ones." Her gaze then saw Ortho approaching in her periphereal and she walked over towards him instead of Eiyu.* - Fri Nov 20 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: That woman is from Amegakure..... she's amusing, and a bitch. I kind of like her. - Fri Nov 20 23:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: ..Hmph. .. -Oh, yeah.. Now would be fine, I can't stay here much longer... Duty calls.. - Fri Nov 20 23:10:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: She's the type of person you keep around to lighten the mood because of her ego. - Fri Nov 20 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: For once. - Fri Nov 20 23:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's nostrils flared in anger and then she trailed after Ortho, running after him if necessary.* - Fri Nov 20 23:11:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's funny how those shinobi work. Once they kill their target they don't go after the people affiliated with that one specific person. - Sat Nov 21 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I doubt they'll come for you.. - Sat Nov 21 00:13:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Then why do you think you will die? - Sat Nov 21 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because if he brings his forces to fight me, I'm taking on him and all of them. - Sat Nov 21 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm using my forces to aid you and the others to safety. - Sat Nov 21 00:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) inhaled sharply as she was jumped upon. She winced in pain (because she is still hella swore) and opened her eyes to stare back up at him before whispering. "Am I going to marry a cat?"* - Sat Nov 21 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nuzzled her nose against his own gently and brushed her lips against his as well. "I love you, Ortho.... and I want to marry you, sooner rather than later.... because I don't want to miss the chance to have a tattoo around my finger showing I am yours."* - Sat Nov 21 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Forever. - Sat Nov 21 00:36:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) flushed a light pink.* - Sat Nov 21 00:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked at him seriously with a bit of nervousness, "You all in, Sensei?"* - Sat Nov 21 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) walked out of the house and practically ran into Menma as she came out the door.* - Sat Nov 21 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) walked out of the house, pretty relaxed with no shinobi gear on. Yawning lightly as she rubbed under her chin at her neck and then shifted her shoulders to stretch the muscles. Her body was still sore in places, mainly her abs, but she was healing fairly quickly.* - Sat Nov 21 09:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) quickly rushed over towards Ortho and took the bandages from him trying to help him in the most basic ability to wrap wounds in the field. "What the fuck happened?" muttered out as she tried not to become angry and simply focus on helping him.* - Sat Nov 21 10:03:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Is it any good? - Sat Nov 21 10:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) twitched her lips to the side and finished off the bandages to try and stop the bleeding for now. "Who was it?" her voice was laced with hate and she was trying to hold it together while knelt at his side. Her hands were shaking with how angry she was becoming. Ziare's comment was ingored so that she wouldn't try and tear his head off from the burn she felt inside of her chest and head.* - Sat Nov 21 10:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It's extremely flexible. - Sat Nov 21 10:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And would make for one of my best jutsus to date. - Sat Nov 21 10:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Do me a favor and just calm down.. - Sat Nov 21 10:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'm fine, I promise. - Sat Nov 21 10:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes and took a few long breathes in and out calming herself. Nodding to Ortho and then reopening her eyes, "do you want me to go get any of your medical supplies?"* - Sat Nov 21 10:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It's just slightly opened wounds. Nothing big. If the bleeding doesn't stop I'll stitch it up. - Sat Nov 21 10:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded and stood up behind Ortho for now, watching Ziare.* - Sat Nov 21 10:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: He took me in at one point. - Sat Nov 21 10:14:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: He asked me to save his genin from danger in a mission. - Sat Nov 21 10:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I went and did just that. - Sat Nov 21 10:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Heiwa was one of them. - Sat Nov 21 10:15:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah he most likely died taking those. - Sat Nov 21 10:21:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: They're on the upcoming as well, but their import for export ratio is pretty much in their favor. - Sat Nov 21 10:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I need to know what they're gathering and by how much. - Sat Nov 21 10:27:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) continues to stand there silently.* - Sat Nov 21 10:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) had been close by when Ortho rose to go towards the incoming attacks. Following shortly after she stayed back among the torn bodies of the guards Kana had managed to obliterate. Glancing over them for a short moment and then towards Kana and her enraged words only proved some of what Eri knew. She wanted to move towards Ziare and Ortho's side, but hesitated as she recalled Ortho's words in the past. She was certain she couldn't take on Kana and so hung back where she was, waiting till she may be needed...* - Sat Nov 21 11:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Don't hurt her man, she's just a girl, we can all just talk this out... - Sat Nov 21 11:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) took a step closer warrily while watching. She thought this had been too easy to stop Kana...there's no way she was that easy to detain. Her gaze shifted over the serpents and then Ziare, followed by focusing on Kana and trying to watch for anything tricky.* - Sat Nov 21 11:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I don't think killing a bunch of defenseless guards is a good look for a future leader. - Sat Nov 21 12:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It isn't. - Sat Nov 21 12:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Ziare, what's your favorite number? - Sat Nov 21 12:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) walked forward and stood a few steps behind Ortho.* - Sat Nov 21 12:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Lucky number 7. - Sat Nov 21 12:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Then seven of her fingers come off today. - Sat Nov 21 12:11:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ....are you sure? - Sat Nov 21 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Promise. - Sat Nov 21 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I swear.... if she touches him. - Sat Nov 21 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yo Ortho, you know I specialize in suport orriented combat. - Sat Nov 21 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nostrils flared slightly at Ortho asking them to leave and then she turned to walk away from the area. Her dark gaze shifted over Menma for a moment but not for long.* - Sat Nov 21 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Let me give you a hand. - Sat Nov 21 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: What's wrong with her body? - Sat Nov 21 12:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: She's constantly twitching. - Sat Nov 21 12:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm? - Sat Nov 21 12:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked the male over with her dark gaze and nodded to him. "Supaiku," it was clearly a surname, so she was keeping things formal. "Haven't seen you around here more than a few times," most of the times she had spotted him he was sleeping under a tree.* - Sat Nov 21 12:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Great. . .more idle chatter. - Sat Nov 21 12:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Tch. . .I come back after being injured and the first day people get slaughtered. - Sat Nov 21 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Where is Ortho? - Sat Nov 21 12:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow at what Menma called her. "I've never been called Sai before, mn... yes nice to meet you Menma, are you from Konoha originally?" Eri, herself, had a konoha headband gauntlet on her right hand and wrist, the only thing that really looked 'shinobi-esque' about her current attire. She was dressed fairly feminine with a ruffled skirt, edgy studded shirt and jacket, lots of piercings, and smokey make up. Her gaze shifted over towards Hatsu for a moment wondering if he just got back from his last mission that took him away for at least a week.* - Sat Nov 21 12:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: He's dealing with something at the gate, we were told to leave. - Sat Nov 21 12:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'll be heading in anyway. - Sat Nov 21 12:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....He said no. - Sat Nov 21 12:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Even if Ziare didn't listen to him. - Sat Nov 21 12:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Don't care. - Sat Nov 21 12:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) craned her head to the side watching him crouch, for a moment she wondered if he was looking up her skirt but decided to ignore it. "Kumogakure... did Eiyu-kun send you here to help Ortho? Or how did you come to this settlement?" She was curious how someone from Kumogakure even heard of this place.* - Sat Nov 21 12:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose her brow at the mention of a brother, "who is your brother?"* - Sat Nov 21 12:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Told this boy. - Sat Nov 21 12:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: He didn't listen. - Sat Nov 21 12:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'm quite sick of having to End fights Ortho somehow drags up. - Sat Nov 21 12:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't know who that was and so simply pursed her lips and shifted her gaze towards Hatsu. "I wasn't here for part of the time, went out on a mission, other than that, been pretty regular." She shifted her gaze back towards Menma, "are you here to stay permanently?"* - Sat Nov 21 12:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm, alright. . anyway, you guys might have better sight than me, if you see a guard running this way let me know. . . - Sat Nov 21 12:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I kinda hope Ortho doesn't need me. I'm too tired. . . - Sat Nov 21 12:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why would he send for Hatsu.... he trusts him so much, it agrivates me. - Sat Nov 21 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's nostrils flared for a moment as she looked towards Hatsu's position and nodded casually. "You should definitely stay if you want, but make your decision now and stick to it. We don't want you just flip flopping, that makes for people who betray the family." She was referencing family to the settlement in general to show how close they were here. Lifting her right hand to show the headband and then dropping her hand back to her side, "Konoha shinobi in the past, came here as soon as I heard about another shinobi settlement was in play within Fire Country."* - Sat Nov 21 12:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes dilated some as he mentioned the name Uchiha, her eyes were dark enough though it might have kept him from noticing. "You are related to Ortho?" She shifted her gaze towards Hatsu again and back towards Menma as her heart rate picked up lightly.* - Sat Nov 21 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) glanced towards the growling stomach but said nothing, he was a big boy... he could get food if he was hungry but he chose to sit here and look up her skirt. "Why'd he give you his family name if you aren't blood? You do something to earn his trust?" She was curious how he had earned the name unless he really was of Ortho's heritage. 

Concerning the scroll she simply questioned, "What is it of? I'm learning some genjutsu, yeah."* - Sat Nov 21 13:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Just the Death Mirage technique. - Sat Nov 21 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'll be handing another one over once I get better with it. - Sat Nov 21 13:15:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: What will you have fo me? - Sat Nov 21 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Another Genjutsu scroll. - Sat Nov 21 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Oh wait. . hell. - Sat Nov 21 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I have to return to Kumo today. . . - Sat Nov 21 13:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Sat Nov 21 13:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Why are you dealing with Kumogakure? That's my job. - Sat Nov 21 13:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's nostrils flared and luckily for Menma because of what Hatsu said it distracted her from noticing him looking up her skirt.* - Sat Nov 21 13:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm not. - Sat Nov 21 13:19:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Take your assignment away? - Sat Nov 21 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: What are you talking about? - Sat Nov 21 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was flustered and shifted to crossing her arms, "nothing...nevermind."* - Sat Nov 21 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: If you're that upset about me going places. - Sat Nov 21 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: It isn't about that... - Sat Nov 21 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Perhaps I can talk Ortho into letting you go with me somewhere. - Sat Nov 21 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Sat Nov 21 13:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) grumbled and kicked her shoe against the grass lightly, her eyes crossing over Menma's flushed cheeks for a moment.* - Sat Nov 21 13:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...you are a terrible liar. - Sat Nov 21 13:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: If you keep crouching like that my Sensei is going to assume you are looking up my skirt. - Sat Nov 21 13:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: When he comes back. - Sat Nov 21 13:28:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Hm, perhaps I'll talk with Ortho about letting her leave with me. I don't need her pissed off at me, and that'd likely help. - Sat Nov 21 13:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled slowly and then devilishly. "Like I said, you probably should move back some before he comes and see's you looking up my skirt."* - Sat Nov 21 13:37:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head as she strolled down the street, "I don't really cook for others, I just make something that is good for my work out that day and it isn't all that tasty normally." She -could- make good food, but chose to take the cheapest healthiest route. When he shook his head she glanced to Menma but doubted he did, he seemed like a good guy type. "Too bad, I was hoping to score some bud to relax after we ate." She shrugged and kept on walking.* - Sat Nov 21 15:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) chuckled at the fact Menma didn't know what they were talking about. She looked over a menu shortly and then ordered some Onigiri with plum sauce and a cup of orange blossom tea. "Yeah, I could tell he was a good boy, surprised he looked up my skirt."* - Sat Nov 21 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) chuckled again at Hatsu's attempt and she began to drip some honey into her tea before stirring it slowly. "That was a weak attempt to ask me out, I think you are going to have to try harder than that for me to even take it seriously. I'll choose to make the food next time." Her gaze shifted to the side over Menma, "You alright there, guy?" She brought her tea to her lips and sipped slowly after blowing lightly across the surface.* - Sat Nov 21 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) used her chopsticks to dip one of the onigiri into the sauce and then began to chew slowly. She always ended up ordering the simplest things from cafe's since she didn't like eating out.* - Sat Nov 21 15:29:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) misheard Hatsu for a moment on the question directed to Menma and widened her eyes subtly. She eased them back and then sipped her tea trying to get her mind off things bothering her.* - Sat Nov 21 15:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: o.o0 - Sat Nov 21 15:41:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: He's pretty interesting to fight against though. - Sat Nov 21 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: I need to find someone around my level though. - Sat Nov 21 15:59:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) leaned in close to Hatsu's face with her own, staring deep into his eyes. Her voice was quite serious and low in seriousness, "don't ever tell me what to do, I know how to keep myself hidden better than any one in the settlement. I keep my tracks hidden and I don't need reminded of how dangerous the name Ortho is in public. So maybe you should be more careful on the things you say to your companions who are there to back you up. I'm perfectly aware of what happened in Kumogakure, but it is a safe place for us. My face isn't recognized and the Raikage would protect me with his life if he had to."* - Sat Nov 21 16:13:13 2015

She tugged it on and wrapped it tight before buttoning it up and pulling her hood up. The chill in the mountains was bad and Menma probably would get cold if he didn't have something warm to wear. As she approached Eiyu she nodded her head in his direction, "Hey there Eiyu-kun."* - Sat Nov 21 16:40:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was easily picked up due to her light weight but she didn't groan at all, she seemed perfectly fine and even chuckled at his childishness. His dorky comment was heard but she shook her head towards him in shame, it was a terrible pun. "Don't worry about Hatsu, he's upset because I came here when he kept trying to tell me it was dangerous. I insisted that Kumogakure was safe though.~"* - Sat Nov 21 17:05:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stared up to him as he sat her down and didn't like what he had whispered. Her eyes were serious as she waited for him to tell them something. Before he continued Eri spoke up, "He told me someone from Kiri was here and attacked him..he didn't say anything about you."* - Sat Nov 21 17:10:24 2015
