<br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Perhaps we should head back, I'm not sure you were allowed to leave. - Sat Nov 21 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Uh...Sure. - Sat Nov 21 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: Where did you guys come from? - Sat Nov 21 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Sunagakure. - Sat Nov 21 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Sat Nov 21 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Menma-san it's bad to lie. - Sat Nov 21 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: We are from Konoha. - Sat Nov 21 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: I see. - Sat Nov 21 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) held up her gauntlet that had a headband sewn into it.* - Sat Nov 21 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Yes, we can. - Sat Nov 21 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'm Eiyu's bodyguard. - Sat Nov 21 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: Name's menia. - Sat Nov 21 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...nice for you? - Sat Nov 21 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Oh, he already has one. - Sat Nov 21 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Kind of small to be a body guard. - Sat Nov 21 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) started to walk away while waving Menma along.* - Sat Nov 21 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah, fishing sounds good. I don't have a pole though, are you gonna skinny dip fish? - Sat Nov 21 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Not that small.. - Sat Nov 21 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mkay. - Sat Nov 21 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm.. - Sat Nov 21 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) have returned!* - Sat Nov 21 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sat down on the bank and watched what he was doing, "I broke my Sensei's rule and went to Kumogakure to strike an alliance for him."* - Sat Nov 21 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded slightly to what he said and then rose a brow at his method of catching fish. "....interesting tactic."* - Sat Nov 21 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow watching him carefully as he made the bad joke to imply wanting to see her naked. "What if I had taken you up on the offer? You would have looked pretty stupid then." She watched him flick another stone and found it amazing how he could do this.* - Sat Nov 21 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) made a 'not bad' expression. "Huh... didn't think any man could admit that."* - Sat Nov 21 19:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stared at the rock, "I can't use lightning...thanks though." She shrugged and looked over his features. "I know you wouldn't, it was obvious."* - Sat Nov 21 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head, "you can do that... I'm going to go back to the settlement... I'm not very hungry, too much on my mind." She was irritated that something that was suppose to happen two days ago still hadn't.* - Sat Nov 21 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded and then stood up and walked across the water back towards the settlement. "This was fun, Menma-san."* - Sat Nov 21 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) walked into the settlement and sat next to Ortho.* - Sat Nov 21 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: We're leaving out soon. - Sat Nov 21 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sighed out and then tried to take the needle and thread from him and began to stitch his arm up for him if he allowed it. She wasn't as good as him at it but she was better than trying to stitch yourself with one hand. "Where to?" She didn't mention the fact it had been several days since he had made a promise to her.* - Sat Nov 21 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was upset he didn't answer but finished the stitching and then bandaged him up and closed her eyes as she cleaned her hands.* - Sat Nov 21 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't know why he was chuckling but she opened her eyes and looked up to him. Soon after she extended her hand up to his and allowed him to pull her up and followed where he pulled her.* - Sat Nov 21 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked around the house, trying to get context clues on where she was.* - Sat Nov 21 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) froze as soon as she entered the house, 'I..." * - Sat Nov 21 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) just stood in the doorway as she listened to him speak. She didn't know what to say or do in that moment.* - Sat Nov 21 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) listened to what he was saying and her heart began to race. As his hand extended out to her she walked further into the room trying to walk quietly and took his hand in her own. Rubbing her lips together and sighing out nervously as she stood beside him and glanced to the wine and then back up to his face. Was this the moment he promised? She wasn't certain but it felt like it might be. She refused to say anything to mess up the moment and simply watched him as he spoke, for once...she was fairly speechless.* - Sat Nov 21 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked at the door at the knock and then frowned before sighing, she knew it wasn't possible for this to go undisturbed. When the announcement was made she was shocked at him kissing her in front of the guards and flushed faintly before following after him. "You aren't leaving me here, I'm coming with you."* - Sat Nov 21 20:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shifted her gaze from Ortho, up to his eyes shifting so quickly, and then over to Edge. She wasn't sure who he was since she had never met Edge before and only had heard of him by name. She swallowed hard and stood a couple feet behind Ortho off to the side. She only looked even mildly like she could be a shinobi because of the metal plated and cloth gauntlet about her right hand and wrist with the Konoha insignia. The rest of her attire, excluding her combat boots, was rather feminine. To top it off she had several body piercings, including her right nostril, and smokey eye make up. She honestly didn't look like all that experienced of a shinobi but her gaze shown a very different story.

Shifting her feet some as her body became tense, the female watched Edge's every move but took note of the light tone in Ortho's voice. Perhaps this was just another incident like Kana's.... at least that is what Eri hoped.* - Sat Nov 21 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: And I assure you. I would not leave your eyes in your sockets. - Sat Nov 21 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: They'd be resting safely, tucked into my pockets. - Sat Nov 21 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Holy...fuck. - Sat Nov 21 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Kana ain't got shit on him. - Sat Nov 21 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes at the aura he was putting out. She wasn't scared of him as she felt it but actually started to smirk up into a sly grin as she felt the raw emotion radiating off of his location. The fact that Edge had come here to compliment Ortho suddenly became rather amusing to her and her body eased up and she adjusted her poster just as Ortho was looking over to calm her nerves. She shifted her gaze to him and then back towards Edge with a single flicking glance, she hoped Ortho would be wise enough to take the warning Edge had given.* - Sat Nov 21 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Well you see. - Sat Nov 21 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I notice you have quite the force here. - Sat Nov 21 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Manpower. - Sat Nov 21 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'll cease the trivialties and beating around the bush. - Sat Nov 21 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I'm sure you are affliated with Sunagakure in one way or another. - Sat Nov 21 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm afraid you're mistaken. - Sat Nov 21 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Then that's only better. - Sat Nov 21 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I've long since cut my ties with Sunagakure. - Sat Nov 21 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Then that's only even better. - Sat Nov 21 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Though. - Sat Nov 21 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: What the shit. - Sat Nov 21 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: 2 fire jusu - Sat Nov 21 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) basically couldn't do anything... She wasn't fast enough to react in the very short amount of time allotted before the explosions began to go off. As Ortho had pulled her to the base of the interior of the summon she curled under and brought her hands over her head as Ortho covered her. She hated that he had done this but knew it was the only chance for her survival likely from whatever thing had just summoned around them. Her eyes closed tightly and she held her breath hoping that in those short moments her life would be sparred...* - Sat Nov 21 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: then* - Sat Nov 21 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Worms. - Sat Nov 21 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: All of them. - Sat Nov 21 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Squirm. - Sat Nov 21 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt the piercing sting of several pieces of shrapnel from other bodies in the trap stabbing into her. Bones, weapons, armor... all of it was being lodged into her sides and her limbs. Screaming out in pain as she shuddered from the shock now flooding her body. As Ortho was flung off of her and stabbed into the ground she was struggling to stand. Half way through standing up, with her body dripping blood and muscles trembling... Edge snatched her up and a hiss sounded as she was pulled up into a full stand beside him.

Snarling her upper lip into a raised arch and her nostrils flaring she looked from the corner of her eyes over towards Edge and in a single blink the black of her iris had shifted to pools of blood red with a single tomoe rotating around her pupil before coming to a stop at the upper right hand corner of each eye.... not long after a second tomoe circled and rested at the bottom left. As soon as it had occured she attempted to close her eyes as quickly as possible to hide her gaze from Edge but was sure it was too late. His words shook through her and she coughed up with a wheeze lightly from the dust that had been inhaled from the attack.

Ortho's words only made her struggle a laugh up with her eyes still shut tightly, "you're even more dense than I thought if you think I have a chance against the likes of him, we both know I'm not going anywhere, Sensei." Her last word being a last ditch effort to console the man on the ground as she awaited Edge's next words.* - Sat Nov 21 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: She has the eyes too... - Sat Nov 21 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: They're breeding. - Sat Nov 21 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Like insects. - Sat Nov 21 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: This is a village of the red-eyed. - Sat Nov 21 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: I have little time left though. - Sat Nov 21 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: Your instructions will come by mail. - Sat Nov 21 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: I suggest you follow every instruction. - Sat Nov 21 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) groaned at what was being said and how Ortho was reacting. He was overreacting and giving Edge more material to work with and it ended up with her feeling sick. Before she could even think to open her mouth to speak the hand already had slammed against her midsection. Darkness clouded her mind, and she was left unconscious in Edge's grip.* - Sat Nov 21 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Damn. . . - Sat Nov 21 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: -omit- - Sat Nov 21 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: I still... had to show you....my technique....you asshole...*sob* - Sat Nov 21 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) groaned in pain as she was being carried in such a potato sack way. When she reawakened the heat and pain began to come back to her and she screamed against Ziare's chest. "Nng.." peering up to Ziare but she assumed everyone of worth was alive since she had heard the warning from Edge and what he wanted. The shrapnel of bone, armor peices, and weapon's broken up and stabbed into different parts of her limbs and sides made her tremble in a heavy shock and pain. "W-wh..." She lulled her head back and struggled to keep focus, eyelids opening and shutting slowly as she tried to bring herself back to reality.* - Sat Nov 21 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) hissed as he lay her on the bed and then gasped as she wasn't being moved anymore. Suddenly she realized the only thing she was capable of doing was breathing. Her eyes shifted down to the shadow and she then grit her teeth and screamed inwardly as her eyes looked up to him with rage and helplessness. She wanted to speak up when she was called Ortho's girlfriend then but wasn't allowed to speak and remained frozen. She was panting heavily and it was obvious how angry she was that he was doing this to her. She didn't want to be locked in this room.. on this bed..unable to move. She wanted to rip the shrapnel out and go see the others but was forced to remain idle.* - Sat Nov 21 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was struggling to stay awake...she was locked in a shadow prison by a kunai stabbed into the bed beside her. She was bleeding from several places where shrapnel was lodged into her sides and limbs.* - Sat Nov 21 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shuddered heavily as he was removing the shrapnel from her body. She hated that he made her not feel even further by numbing her. As he worked on her she cried silently and stared at him in silence. She wanted to tell him not to do more than he had to but she was unable to move or speak.* - Sat Nov 21 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes and let him finish off, it wasn't like she had a choice in the matter.* - Sat Nov 21 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Don't think about it...until you can speak.. - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Don't think... - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Don't think....just...don't. - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) reopened her eyes when he was no longer touching her and she couldn't BELIEVE he was working on his wounds now rather than releasing her from the shadow bind. A long groan sounded in frustration as she panted and glared towards Ortho.* - Sat Nov 21 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gasped and shifted on the bed without much control because of the numbing medication. "O-ortho...." her voice was weak and broken as too many emotions clouded her mind. "Is this....real?"* - Sun Nov 22 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) slowly tried to reach out for his hand, "I'm not going to die.... if you have anything to do with it...and if I do.. then it just means you did what you thought was right, handsome. I'm sorry... I'm sorry I was there to be your weakness..." She sighed defeated.* - Sun Nov 22 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wasn't able to hold his hand tightly, so there was that. She listened with her eyes half open to the entire thing until he said Hatsu was dead. Her eyes opened wide and she gripped his hand tightly then for a moment as her heart rate froze and then went nuts as her breathing sped up and she felt like she was going to pass out as she hyperventilated. "H-hatsu?" She could hardly speak as she felt a huge knot in her throat and recalled their last few hours together traveling. She had finally got to travel with him and spent a good portion of it picking on him as usual. She cringed and sobbed hard as she tried to hide her emotional pain.* - Sun Nov 22 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Ugh....No... - Sun Nov 22 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ---- - Sun Nov 22 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: This useless.. piece of shit- - Sun Nov 22 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Fine.. - Sun Nov 22 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Okay bye now. - Sun Nov 22 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) walked out, limping of course with stitches visible in various places on her arms and legs. None of them were longer than three or four stitches long, it just made it hard to walk normally.* - Sun Nov 22 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) made her way past Ishi since they didn't know each other personally. She gave Ziare a glance of distaste but it quickly disolved as she mouthed the words 'thank you' silently. She made her way over to under a tree and took a seat with a heavy groan before leaning back against the trunk and groaning painfully.* - Sun Nov 22 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) glanced about with a weak demeanor, it looked like Menma was napping again and she wasn't sure what Ortho was doing.* - Sun Nov 22 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Everything just ...sucks. - Sun Nov 22 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sighed and sat there for a long time before speaking up with her eyes hardly open enough to see the grass in front of her. "Ziare.... thank you for making  me stay in the bed...even if I wanted to kill you for it at the time, I understand it was necessary." She had struggled to say those words since she hated what he had done but knew that he hadn't acknowledged her first thanks to him in a silent way.* - Sun Nov 22 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: if you plan on leaving the village. - Sun Nov 22 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Be careful. - Sun Nov 22 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: There is a trap at the gate. - Sun Nov 22 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah, I saw it before. - Sun Nov 22 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Thanks. - Sun Nov 22 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Mmm.. - Sun Nov 22 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked from Ziare to Ortho. "Ortho should have it, he's the one that disabled the ...whatever it is." She heard Ortho's request and slowly worked her way up the tree to stand with winces of pain and grunts. Once she was standing she nodded to Ortho that she was ready to leave.* - Sun Nov 22 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Disabled? - Sun Nov 22 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: All you gotta do is pull the kunai out. - Sun Nov 22 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: That's what I mean. - Sun Nov 22 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Or turn the lights off. - Sun Nov 22 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Both would have worked. - Sun Nov 22 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: So simply...and I was trapped... - Sun Nov 22 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: I wonder if that's how he keeps the ladies in bed. - Sun Nov 22 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Okay no...that was low. - Sun Nov 22 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: I prefer date rape drugs, les chakra to expend. - Sun Nov 22 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: -omit- - Sun Nov 22 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) follows of course.* - Sun Nov 22 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded slowly, "he could have just killed one of us."* - Sun Nov 22 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Now we have a whole ten days to say goodbye... - Sun Nov 22 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...well... like nine now. - Sun Nov 22 09:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt him take her hand and looked up to him with saddened bloodshot eyes. "You know you can't do that...it's a death sentence to you and the entire settlement to attack Sunagakure."* - Sun Nov 22 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...that's so dumb.... - Sun Nov 22 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Don't toss away .... -everything- for my life. - Sun Nov 22 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You don't even know if he will come back and release me. - Sun Nov 22 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I risk I'm willing to take.. I have a plan to make it seem like we're not even the ones behind the attack. - Sun Nov 22 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sighed out heavily and sat down on the grass, "Ngn... it's.... what if.... what if they find out? And why did this guy have to do what he did? You might have worked something out with him and attacked Suna anyway with an organized plan... who the hell even was he? Fuck... I mean... I should have just listened to you for once, I should have just stayed in Konoha." She reached her hands up to her head and held it as her eyes closed and tears started to drip to the grass between her legs. "I was so stupid, no matter how much we hid who we were, someone... a stranger, figured out just by looking at us standing beside each other, I was a weakness for you without us even being public about it, now I'm going to die... he's playing you like a puppet and you are willingly going to do what he wants because I am in danger."* - Sun Nov 22 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: -That- was Edge? - Sun Nov 22 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded slowly as she swallowed hard and wiped her tears with her sleeves. "Nng... fine... but I hate that I was used that way... if I'm the reason for your settlement to die, I'll never forgive myself... that's if he even releases me."* - Sun Nov 22 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I got this, babe. - Sun Nov 22 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I promise. - Sun Nov 22 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....hah.. - Sun Nov 22 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head trying hard not to smile, "You're stupid."* - Sun Nov 22 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Like I said.. Could've been worse. - Sun Nov 22 09:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'd be more mad if he.. i don't know.. - Sun Nov 22 09:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Took all the liquor.. - Sun Nov 22 09:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'd really be dead. - Sun Nov 22 09:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Hush... - Sun Nov 22 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Just... - Sun Nov 22 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Can you tell me something you probably don't even know yourself.... - Sun Nov 22 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Why did he do...what he did...the way he did? - Sun Nov 22 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Our Sharingan and his.. eyes.. - Sun Nov 22 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: They're viewed differently. - Sun Nov 22 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Gezo takes our eyes as some evil power that must be destroyed. - Sun Nov 22 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But they view his eyes as some sacred thing that must be praised. - Sun Nov 22 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: So he works for them... - Sun Nov 22 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Like he said.. it's ironic how he's the 'evil' one and I'm the 'good'- - Sun Nov 22 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No. - Sun Nov 22 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: He just got his hands on something that the Gezo cherishes. - Sun Nov 22 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Does he hate our eyes? - Sun Nov 22 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes and no. - Sun Nov 22 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ..I think he might have seen mine... - Sun Nov 22 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: From how he was determined to make me turn mines off- - Sun Nov 22 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: How..? - Sun Nov 22 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I couldn't stop it... - Sun Nov 22 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Why..? - Sun Nov 22 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: When he grabbed me... I was panicking... - Sun Nov 22 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I was in shock... - Sun Nov 22 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..I see, I see. - Sun Nov 22 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I closed them quickly... but.. - Sun Nov 22 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It'll be alright. - Sun Nov 22 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't -know- for certain he saw them or didn't see them. - Sun Nov 22 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I got you, no worries. If he did or didn't, doesn't matter. - Sun Nov 22 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Is it bad.... that before he attacked I actually enjoyed his disposition? - Sun Nov 22 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Why'd he have to....  - Sun Nov 22 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Ugh... - Sun Nov 22 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) mumbled, "Hatsu..."* - Sun Nov 22 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Oi.. - Sun Nov 22 09:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Listen.. - Sun Nov 22 09:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: We're going to pay Hatsujin back, alright? - Sun Nov 22 09:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No matter what.. he didn't die in vain.. - Sun Nov 22 09:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: How ... that guy just...snapped his fingers. - Sun Nov 22 09:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: 'Bloody Mary'...and it was over. - Sun Nov 22 09:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't know how I'm going to do it.. but I'm going to do it. - Sun Nov 22 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't think you should start a fight with him. - Sun Nov 22 09:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Not planning to. - Sun Nov 22 09:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Going to go through with my plan.. - Sun Nov 22 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I.... - Sun Nov 22 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I'm not pregnant.... - Sun Nov 22 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Sun Nov 22 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) turned and leaned into Ortho's chest careful of his wounds but tears started to fall in steady streams.* - Sun Nov 22 10:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sniffled as she sobbed and held onto him. Muttering against his chest, her words were mumbled, "I just wanted something good right now... and it just keeps being either bad or news that sucks... I just wanted something good...." She gasped lightly and leaned back to look up at him. "I just wanted something good out of allthe bad..."* - Sun Nov 22 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rested her head back against his chest, "can we just... please just get the tattoos...say we are married...and be done with it..."* - Sun Nov 22 10:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked up to him and simply whispered, "Why'd we come here? You know how to tattoo or something now? Hidden talents, Otho?" She smiled weakly and held onto him.* - Sun Nov 22 10:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded towards him and nuzzled her nose against his neck. "Alright, whatever you want."* - Sun Nov 22 10:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You know I'm not about that mushy gush. - Sun Nov 22 10:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Maybe food.... food that's so... -so- unhealthy but warm... - Sun Nov 22 10:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Doesn't mean you can't accept the rare moment where you get to order your sensei aro- - Sun Nov 22 10:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: He's doing so well... we both know I'm going to die. - Sun Nov 22 10:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) jumped as the guards appeared. She clutched onto Ortho and sighed out heavily. "Nng... mean..." grumbled under her breath for only him to hear as they left. "Five kids... that's... a lot... can you learn how to have babies yourself?"* - Sun Nov 22 10:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) frowned up at him with a scowl, "I'm not having a midget."* - Sun Nov 22 10:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes, "a pet dog? We have pet snakes."* - Sun Nov 22 10:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) huffed in shock and used her hand to push his head gently since the rest of his body was pretty much hurt. "I feel weak, Ortho... like -really- weak... it doesn't feel natural."* - Sun Nov 22 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head, "like my spirit is weak... I mean my body hurts but nothing too terrible to cause this. It feels like... locked inside."* - Sun Nov 22 11:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Locked..? - Sun Nov 22 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) just sat there as he ripped her shirt upwards to look at the seal on her belly. She didn't understand what was going on at all or what a root seal was.* - Sun Nov 22 11:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Sun Nov 22 11:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked at him seriously, "are you saying...." She frowned and shook her head soon after. Even if it was a ploy that didn't matter. She formed handseals for a basic wind release and held her hand out but nothing happened and her fingers trembled. "Nothing..." She sighed out, "I can't even help you with the attack then.. mother fucker..." She leaned back against the couch and closed her eyes. "Helpless..."* - Sun Nov 22 11:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked up to him as he gripped her lips and grumbled. "Yeah I know...but honestly, he is going to kill me either way.. even if he didn't really seal that on me. He'll kill me to get what he wants, or he will find a way to really curse me and hold it over your head. It's going to become a pattern, you know it is."* - Sun Nov 22 11:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow at what he said. "Amegakure disbanded? I mean... I guess that is no harm then if they are the assumed attackers."* - Sun Nov 22 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Yes, I know.... - Sun Nov 22 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right.. - Sun Nov 22 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Anyways.. - Sun Nov 22 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked over the food to see what they had but her mind was preoccupied, even as hungry as she was. As the scent filled her nostrils, her belly grumbled.* - Sun Nov 22 11:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) groaned softly as he opened the food up on her lap. She instantly reached for the cheese fries and grabbed about three of them and stuffed them past her lips. Groaning out more and leaning her head back against his shoulder. "I never... -ever-... eat bad food... fuck... ngn..." She always  was watching her figure because she was so short and usually didn't even eat seasoned food, most times she was more focused on eating food that was healthy for her body. Taking more fries coated in melted cheese she ate them one by one and moaned over the food. You'd think she never had a carb before...* - Sun Nov 22 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) slowed down and looked back to him. "You don't want any?" She dipped some of the cheese fries in some special sauce and wiggled it in front of his lips before deciding she didn't want to give it to him and snatched it with her teeth. "You are trying to make me fat I think."* - Sun Nov 22 12:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) pouted and pressed her lips against his gently before pulling back a small amount, "tell me.~"* - Sun Nov 22 12:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) chuckled gently and jumped a bit atop him as he squeezed. Holding onto the several to go containers of food. "Hmph, do you not enjoy the cushion already offered to you?"* - Sun Nov 22 12:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wiggled atop him with her bum and then ate a few more things from the selection. She easily became full quickly from the greasy and heavy food. When she finished she put the left overs on the coffee table and closed her eyes nuzzling in against his neck. "What now?"* - Sun Nov 22 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shifted so she was sitting sideways on his lap and wrapped an arm around the back of the couch. "Hm.. okay, are we going to talk about the design of the tattoo or something? What do you want?"* - Sun Nov 22 12:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thought for a moment in silence as she stared up at the ceiling.* - Sun Nov 22 12:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Shhhhh. - Sun Nov 22 12:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ---- - Sun Nov 22 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Pfft.. - Sun Nov 22 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Tick.. tock.. - Sun Nov 22 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I know. - Sun Nov 22 12:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Well  maybe. - Sun Nov 22 12:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) took out a napkin from the meal and then wrote on the page. She had written out the kanji for the letters 'E' and 'O' right next to each other. "Hm? Or no?"* - Sun Nov 22 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Or... - Sun Nov 22 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ....... - Sun Nov 22 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wrote down a strand of kanji with her name beside it, and a string of kanji with his name beside it. "Have this wrap around the finger..."

Eri: https://gyazo.com/f240c8ff57ae80ac9449be72630f04e4

Ortho: https://gyazo.com/d9387e84b1f6e3c3e330ce03c60a96a4* - Sun Nov 22 12:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Heh. - Sun Nov 22 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her lip and leaned in aganst his cheek to nuzzle him again, it seemed like she was much closer right now than she had ever been before. Generally she wasn't this cuddly but for now Eri wasn't going to let go of Ortho if her life depended on it. * - Sun Nov 22 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) began to smile slowly, "so I have a question, you've mentioned your partners in the past vaguely. Am I going to have to deal with jealousy at any point from anyone because I locked you in?~" She was teasing him of course but there was some part of her that was really curious about if there would be issues in the future.* - Sun Nov 22 12:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded slowly, "right... I wanted to talk to you about that... why...did you kill your brother?"* - Sun Nov 22 13:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) frowned heavily, "I see..... so your brother and you were enemies to the end?"* - Sun Nov 22 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded slowly, "you mentioned he was with the girl that went away for four years.... if she comes back... what will happen?"* - Sun Nov 22 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Will she want you...will she try to kill you... - Sun Nov 22 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Will you want her? - Sun Nov 22 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Want me? Doubt it. - Sun Nov 22 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Kill me? Probably.. - Sun Nov 22 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Want her? I'm married. - Sun Nov 22 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her lip and used her finger to draw circles against his neck right over the vein pumping blood to his head. "I mean.... things happen, you loved her... just know that if you did anything like that... I'd very likely kill whoever touched you and then you'd be in big trouble."* - Sun Nov 22 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) paused her finger's movements and reached for his jaw to slowly turn and kiss him gently. Then leaned to whisper in his ear, "I would never do such a horrendous thing as what she did to you, I am yours always, even after your death in battle."* - Sun Nov 22 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) huffed and blew in his eye as payback about the cheating comment. Her huff was cut short by the kiss, she became distracted and kissed him back deeply with her tongue pressing between his lips and trying to taste his tongue for herself. "Mng..." eyes lulled closed as her breath became shallow and she got into it as she awaited for him to allow her to breath again.* - Sun Nov 22 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gasped for air but it was cut off quickly as he kissed her again deeply. "Mngngerg!" She squirmed against him and wrapped her hands up behind his neck and fingers found his hair as her head craned to the right to deepen the kiss. Her breathing was labored now and she could feel her stitches tensing from the way her body tensed up. Her nostrils flared as she felt her eyes flutter open lightly and closed again. Her body shifted against his lap as she tried to shift downwards more and trying to pull him with her so that she was more in a laying position against the arm of the couch.* - Sun Nov 22 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whined out gently as he started to tease her. Lifting her head and trying to kiss him but failing miserably... she was so much weaker than she normally was and he was taking advantage of it. She tried to bit down on his bottom lip and suck on it to will him to kiss her.* - Sun Nov 22 15:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) released his lip as he spoke and then gave him a pathetic glare as he mentioned them not seeing each other. "Are you trying to imply you want to stop?"* - Sun Nov 22 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) held her breath as her shirt was forced open to reveal her dark red bra that was see through except for where the wiring and straps were. Her nipples were hardened against the thin cloth and stuck out lightly as he revealed the stitching along her sides and licked up her midsection. Inhaling sharply and leaning her head back with a small arch of her back she strained her stitches just above her hips a bit. "Nngn... are you certain? I mean... we can always hold back... be 'good'."* - Sun Nov 22 16:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) snickered as he continued to kiss and lick up her body. As he pressed her breasts together she inhaled gently and looked down to him with a foggy gaze, "what if the tattoo artist shows up?" She then bit down on her lip as he started licking between her breasts and over the upper curve of each. That was enough to send her down a path of heating up but she was trying to resist, knowing that they generally were too rough for the likes of her stitches to survive a romping.* - Sun Nov 22 16:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gasped as he sucked and licked about her nipple. She squirmed for a small moment before regaining control. That is until he pinched and tugged at her nipple. That instantly got a polite moan out of her as she curled her toes and had to try and bite back a larger reaction. "O-okay, not like... I could push you off if I wanted to, big guy...nng.." She looked up to him and then thought the better of this. "We should be careful... uh.. s-stitches.."* - Sun Nov 22 16:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes as he pulled her hands up over her head and pinned them some. A small skip of her heart beat and then racing as her breathing picked up and it instantly rose the situation by ten fold. Her nipples hardened at the sensation of danger and as he licked and sucked it only made her squirm more. Part of her was enjoying it a little too much that he had her pinned... * - Sun Nov 22 16:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) growled lightly as he rubbed against her pantie covered sex. When he shoved hard she groaned deeply and gave him a glare while tugging her hands against his a bit to test how hard he was holding her down. She was watching him now curiously, while gooseflesh coated her body.* - Sun Nov 22 16:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt him release her hand and then she reached out grabbing his wrist before he reached for his zipper. "C-can we do a little more... teasing? I.. want you to hold me down more...." She turned her head off to the side and lowered her gaze in slight embarrassment. Her cheeks started to pinken up and then turn a deep red as she bit down on her bottom lip. "Unless you can't hold out any longer."* - Sun Nov 22 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her tongue as he held her tighter by the hands and she tested it willingly to feel how hard he was holding her down. Her body shifted a few times uncomfortably but it was obvious by how her panties were soaking through that she liked what was being done. How hard he had clamped down on her nipple was proving fruitful as well, her nipple was swelling an turning a darker shade of pink from the attention and already beginning to feel sore... which she kind of was enjoying admittedly. "Y-yeah, like that...ngn.." a soft pant sounded and she leaned her head back ever so slowly as he took control over her form. Eyes lulled closed gently and she found herself moving against his hips as he grinded in against her pelvis.* - Sun Nov 22 17:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whined gently and was squirming now fully as she felt like she was tingling all over from the chest flowing outwards. "O-ortho...ngng.." she whispered out and couldn't figure out what was going on since he was pushing her closer and closer to the edge as her nipples ached and tingled with a pulsating pleasure. Her legs shifted under his and she tensed her entire body as a sudden burst of hormones screamed through her body. Breathing picked up and she panted heavily as a tiny long moan sounded and her back arched hard enough to pop a few vertebrae. "Nnngngng...." she struggled against him merely from her pleasure alone as he had given her a type of climax that was rarely -ever- achieved.... in fact, Eri didn't know what had just happened and it left her confused and dazed.* - Sun Nov 22 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) || Upon hearing his order to be louder her moan sounded out through parted lips and she arched her neck back and ruffled her hair against the cushion. As he pressed his cock in against her panties to stretch them and force them a few inches inside of her cunt she was sent into a louer moan nearing a scream. "O-okay, p-please... fuuuuu...ngng.. shhit.. just... yes.. please... nngn.. S-sensei, more.. mngng." She was turning her head to the side and then the other as she looked up at him with a pathetic gaze. "Please take me," whined out as she lifted her hips against his to feel him deeper inside of her while her panties kept her from feeling his soft skin against her inner walls. "O-ortho!" screamed out as she became extremely impatient.* - Sun Nov 22 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: ....S-Sai-chan? - Sun Nov 22 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) blinked a few times as she looked to Menma. She was patched up in several places on her limbs with stitches, her other wounds weren't visible. "Yes? Are you alright?" She took a few steps towards him, he looked really upset.* - Sun Nov 22 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) already was walking the rest of the way towards the boy to give him a warm hug as she saw how upset he was. When he held his arms up she was already anticipating them and hugged tightly enough that she could endure with the stitches. "It's alright, I'm good... I'm perfect..." her voice had a hint of sadness and her mind shifted to Edge and his plotting but she forced the thought away.* - Sun Nov 22 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sighed out gently and closed her eyes as she held the younger boy. It was hard for her to really hug him all that much since he was so much larger, he was practically covering her upper body. "Shh... I'm not going anywhere just yet, I'm still here."* - Sun Nov 22 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked down at him, expecting he was looking up her skirt. "You just don't learn huh?"* - Mon Nov 23 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wandered towards the gate, Ortho had been gone a while to speak with whoever was there to see him and she wanted to assure he was alright. When she walked up towards the gate and saw him laying on the ground she headed over towards him and crouched beside him. "Counting clouds?"* - Mon Nov 23 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) frowned fainly and shifted to sitting on the ground beside him and rested her hand on his chest over his heart.* - Mon Nov 23 15:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: What troubles you? - Mon Nov 23 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: My failures thus far. - Mon Nov 23 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Sh... your failures are in the past, and your success is staring you in the eyes right now. - Mon Nov 23 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled gently as she stared down at him.* - Mon Nov 23 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I like what I see. - Mon Nov 23 15:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Good. - Mon Nov 23 15:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Because I'll always be your success. - Mon Nov 23 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: And will help you gain more success. - Mon Nov 23 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Normally I'd call bullshit when someone says anything similar to that.. - Mon Nov 23 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: But the way.. you make everything seem clear. - Mon Nov 23 15:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I can believe it. - Mon Nov 23 15:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: You better, Sensei. - Mon Nov 23 15:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) ran her hand through his hair from hairline and back over the crown of his head. "Now are you going to keep staring at clouds all day or are we going to finally get our tattoo's?"* - Mon Nov 23 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm fidgety to have it out there already. - Mon Nov 23 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't catch on to what he meant but simply stood along side him.* - Mon Nov 23 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) walked into the house and over to the ghetto set up. She settled down into the chair he had there and then directed the artist to which of the tattoo's she was suppose to be receiving. After they had talked over how she wanted it wrapped and the font type and all that good stuff she looked up to Ortho and reached out with her right hand to grip his own. "Last chance to fold, Sensei."* - Mon Nov 23 15:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't expect a small tattoo like this to hurt -so fucking much-. The fact it was on her finger made her whole hand want to shake. She breathed in and out slowly as the tattoo was completed and her hand was red and a bit swollen afterwards. She watched him clean it up and cover the tattoo before looking over to Ortho as his was done. She looked over at his tattoo and read the kanji, her heart skipped a beat as she heard the words of the artist and looked indo Ortho's eyes. 

Leaning over she slowly came to press her lips against his own to give him a deep kiss of love. Whispering after the kiss was broken, "I'll love you even in death."* - Mon Nov 23 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled weakly up to him, "so I am your wife now... Mrs. Ortho Uchiha." She wrinkled her nose, "Is it bad that I like my surname better?" She chuckled and leaned her head in against his chest for a gentle nuzzle. "I suppose I will have to start going by my first name, won't I?" She closed her eyes and thought of things that made her stomach flutter with butterflies.* - Mon Nov 23 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow and looked up to him, "You don't...want to tell people about us?"* - Mon Nov 23 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled warmly and squirmed against him at the word being said, "you can always call me your student, I still am.~" She exhaled out. "What is this plan then? Hm? Tell me everything, I never want to be in the dark when it has to do with you."* - Mon Nov 23 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was in the moment, smiling, and ready to get busy with him but then he stated that rushed statement and she couldn't help her smile completely leaving her face. She lowered her head with hesitation and then forced a weak smile up onto her face again and looked up towards him. "That's fantastic, husband. I'm sure you've made the right choice. Everything will work out as you planned it." Deep down she knew that wasn't true... she knew that if Ortho didn't do what Edge told him to do, specifically, that she would be killed. Regardless that this was not the seal that Edge had stated, she was certain her life was going to come to an end when Edge discovered such plots from Ortho.

She felt a burning in her eyes but kept strong and continued smiling as she blinked a few times to dry any chance of tears falling. She was doing pretty well to hide her emotion behind her love and happiness but he might be able to see past it all. "When will you inform Sunagakure?"* - Mon Nov 23 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) lowered her head as she heard him plan, "And where am I at during this plan that is probably going to get you killed?" She had lost her will to pretend like it was alright now since he saw right through her. She felt felt the playful slap and looked up to him. "Alright... yes, of course... I know you got me, Sensei. I'll do whatever you ask."* - Mon Nov 23 16:37:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: well zeno is the only one that can truly decide the stats buff because he's controlling stats so you will need to discuss them with him but as for what stats, you need to have some debuffs that take away stats in areas and some that give stats] - Mon Nov 23 17:04:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes as she was suddenly kissed in public. She kissed back of course and her left hand came up to his face with the fresh tattoo on her left ring finger in the form of a line of kanji. When he said Konoha she frowned fainly and craned her head to the side some. "Konoha?" She didn't like that he chose that location, it wasn't a location that was wise for her to go to with the entire army but didn't protest and dropped her hand back to her side.* - Mon Nov 23 20:09:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) turned with hesitation as she reached back and gripped Ortho's hand tightly for a moment. She could feel her will weaken just from the idea of leaving his side but she knew it was important she be as far away from him as possible. She released his hand and slowly walked towards the gate. The further she progressed the faster she walked, trying to keep herself from turning back.* - Mon Nov 23 20:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shifted against the cliff side and crossed her arms under her chest. On her left ring finger was a fresh tattoo that seemed to be a string of kanji wrapping about the finger where a ring should be.* - Tue Nov 24 00:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: What did I tell you about insulting people? - Tue Nov 24 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Are they enemys. - Tue Nov 24 00:44:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Do I kill th- Oh okay. - Tue Nov 24 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) had ignored Arihs entirely and was leaned up against the cliffside with her arms crossed under her chest. It might or might not be noticed she had a fresh tattoo around her left ring finger in the form of a circle of kanji. It would have to be looked at closer to be read, of course. She shifted her jacet a bit and dropped her hangs to her sides before walking towards the Raikage. "Eiyu-kun, sorry we keep dropping by like this, but do you mind if we stay a while until we hear some news?" She already was going in for a hug, but if he could read her eyes he might be able to tell she actually -needed- it right now. If he allowed the hug she held on a bit longer than last time.* - Tue Nov 24 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was much faster and much more perceptive than Arihs probably assumed. As the drop kick came at her, Eri literally shot her hand out and gripped the girl by her ankle and twisted it roughly to force the girl to the ground. She wasn't extremely strong so it likely wouldn't damage the girl's leg or anything else for that matter but it certainly would have stopped her.* - Tue Nov 24 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) whispers: Of course. - Tue Nov 24 00:53:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt him hug her from behind and it made her tense for a moment out of surprise after she had just stopped an attacker. She eased back into him and looked up at him as he questioned her. She looked down at her hand and smiled warmly, now that he was closer he could read what it said, the kanji wrapped about her finger said 'All in, Sensei?' She flushed faintly and then stuffed her hand into her pocket. "Uhm.. yeah, I recently got it... like ... a day ago or two. I got another one too, I can show you when we aren't out in the cold." She literally didn't even take the time to retort on what Arihs had said, it wasn't worth her time.* - Tue Nov 24 00:59:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Don't grip so hard. - Tue Nov 24 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Why not? - Tue Nov 24 01:11:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Because you look like a threat. - Tue Nov 24 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That's how you die. - Tue Nov 24 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow as Eiyu stepped around her and she saw two of her men acting out to defend her. "Don't waste your breath on her, clearly she is crying out for attention." She looked over Menma, Mitarashi, and finally Eiyu. (yes i did intentionally call you a female) She looked the boy over in the distance, "her insults mean nothing."* - Tue Nov 24 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Well. They did threatend to hurt me, with the way they are gripping those swords. - Tue Nov 24 01:13:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: To two people, ready to kill. - Tue Nov 24 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: They're going to kill you for sure. - Tue Nov 24 01:13:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: More threatening. - Tue Nov 24 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It looks like you're setting up something. - Tue Nov 24 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Well. - Tue Nov 24 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: It's more so, if they decide to charge at me, i'll have a good defense. - Tue Nov 24 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: So now it's less me attacking, but more be protecting myself. - Tue Nov 24 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....You do know that you attacked me out of no where for trying to hug my friend? - Tue Nov 24 01:15:05 2015

"Uh...no..no he didn't."* - Tue Nov 24 01:23:37 2015
