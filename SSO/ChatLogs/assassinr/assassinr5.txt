<br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sighed heavily and followed quickly after Ortho like a shadow, "Yes, Sir."* - Wed Nov 18 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked around mimicking what he did. When he gripped her hands she widened her eyes staring back into his own in wonder of what he was about to ask her. She didn't get why they had to come off alone until she saw his shift in demeanor, it was like he was back to his normal self almost. Was he pretending to be crazed in public?* - Wed Nov 18 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You know you can ask me anything. - Wed Nov 18 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) veered her head away as she watched him and she rescended her earlier thought quickly and stared at him. "Uh...y-yes? You did say you love me, Ortho." She could feel his heart beating hard but instead of making her feel more in this moment it made her wary of what was wrong with Ortho currently. She was beginning to grow a little more than concerned.* - Wed Nov 18 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Wed Nov 18 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) instantly looked back at him and narrowed her gaze nearly in utter anger, "-Liar-."* - Wed Nov 18 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt her nostrils flare at the fact he dared to lie to her. "You better tell me what you were going to say right now, I can't believe you would lie to me after everything I have gone through." She could feel a large amount of emotions swelling inside of her from the utter rage and disappointment in both of them. She was still panicking about whether or not she was pregnant and it had only been a week so the paranoia was taking a toll on her sleeping habits. The girl looked utterly lost in terms of her emotions.* - Wed Nov 18 08:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes suddenly at what he said. She was frozen and couldn't even breath for a moment as she looked upon him. "Y-you..." she stuttered and closed her eyes as her heart was beating heavily and she couldn't keep control of her emotions as someone had just said they wanted to spend the rest of their lives with her. She took a long moment of thought with head slowly lowering and held up one of her hands, "I just.. just give me a moment," tears began to roll down her cheeks as she stared at the ground between them and remembered all the times her family might have told her it was never going to happen, that no one would ever want her.

Sniffling the young girl then rose her head and tried to look him in the eye as she felt every good moment they had together going through her body and she had to tell him something now more than ever, if she didn't it might cause problems. "I didn't want to say anything, but I'm scared I m-might be pregnant from what happened. I have to wait another t-two weeks to find out for sure but I been getting torn up inside, Ortho. I'm so scared, I don't know how to be a mother, I have a terrible reference from my mother." She could feel the tears dripping from the edge of her jaw to the grass blades at her toes. Reaching up she sort of laughed out while trying to wipe her tears away. 

Swallowing hard, "I never thought a moment like this would happen and now it's just such a weird situation we are in." She wasn't saying no but she wasn't saying yes either at the moment, but surely Ortho could understand why with the type of person Eri was and her past. Gasping out for breath through the tears she couldn't hold back her eyes activating as they turned red and the single tear drop circled her pupil. She was trying to keep it together but now as she stared into his eyes with her heritage open to see it made things easier for her to comprehend. At least that is what it felt like to Eri, she was admittedly a little addicted to the sensation as he had warned her she was going to become, but Eri always forced herself to activate them in moderation.* - Wed Nov 18 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt her chest hitch with a sensation of want for Ortho, to kiss him, to touch him, to hold him... She wanted to say those words nearly just because of everything going on but she didn't actually feel them entirely yet. The fact -alone- that he was almost excited sounding about her being pregnant gave her a realization. 

"You really love me...."

Her voice was hushed as she whispered the words, and then added on as tears streamed from her emotion filled gaze. "I -trust- your love... you do love me." Licking between her lips she leaned in to kiss him without another word, still having not answered his statement about marriage since it really hadn't been asked in the form of a question in all truthfulness. Her lips pressed against his and her eyes fluttered closed as she brought her hands up and held his face in her hands to kiss him gently and then deeper. 

It only took a small moment of her giving herself away to the emotions for her breathing to suddenlly drop into a calmed sigh, her heart rate slowed and then she broke the kiss with her forehead against his own and opened her eyes. It likely would take a moment for Orth to realize but when he opened his eyes to gaze into her own there would be a second black tear drop in the South West corner's of her iris. She hadn't realized it at all, only that she felt at peace now and fully understood what Ortho had been doing before with his village, killing his brother, why he wasn't talking about Nina... about Kirigakure. She understood it all because he loved her and now she trusted him fully with that love and the way he behaved. She simply stared back at him and a new clarity had fallen into her mindset. 

"I will marry you someday, Ortho."* - Wed Nov 18 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wanted to kiss him all over from how big his smile had gotten. Her tears dried and she stared on into his gaze unable to shut off the sensation that she could understand everything he was doing right before her as it was happening. She assumed that the sensation was how much emotion was in the air around them and had no idea it was her actually able to perceive things as they were happening as if it was in slow motion. Then she realized she knew what was happening a little -too- fast. She couldn't predict that Ortho was going to smile so large, larger than he ever had. She had though... so what was going on? 

She blinked several times and the confusion was clear on her expression as she looked him over and started to wonder if this is what love felt like when it wasn't directed towards family members. It was so strong... so ... connected, how could this possibly be real? She kissed him again and even as he might motion to kiss her back it was as if she had learned how he kissed perfectly to match his motions and kiss him in a perfect syncing. Pulling away again she widened her eyes and was freaking out inwardly. 

"Something is different, how can I feel like this? It's like I'm part of you... Ortho, I just..." She was about to say she thought it was love but didn't want to get ahead of herself as she kissed him again deeper this time with her tongue forcing past his lips to try and figure out if she was crazy or if she really was that in touch with his movements. Breaking the kiss again as she leaned her head to the side some and gasped gently while her lips brushed over his cheek and her brow pulled up from being pressed against the temple of his skull. "What have I been missing?" Whispered out between gentle pants, "I'll never leave your side again, even when I'm not there physically, I know I will be there in spirit." * - Wed Nov 18 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was confused and understanding of what he was doing at the same time. It was -sort of- freaking her the fuck out. She stared down at the water and then understood what was going on, she turned her head, moved her face closer to the water and was holding her eyes as wide open as possible. "But this acceptance and understanding...this is surreal... I can ... I can see what is happening as it's happening but like I already knew it was going to happen. It's constant de ja vu." She was feeling over her face to open her eyes wider and look at the second tear drop before looking up to him and then an evil looking smile tugged at her lips. "I beat you."* - Wed Nov 18 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her lip and then tried to pounce him to end up on the grass together with him beneath her. "Oh come on, what was it that little girl said? You were so jealous even of two and especially three.~ What if I get to three before you even get two.~" She snickered and leaned down with her hair hanging over her face against his own and then pressed her lips against his own. Groaning deeply as she tried to assault him with her kisses.* - Wed Nov 18 10:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gave him a look like 'yeah right'. "So you're saying.... if I just... walked up to Hatsu.... all.." She paused and shook her head, "walked up to one of those other guys at the camp and invited them to the river. You wouldn't be jealous in the least?~" She bit down on her lip and rotated her hips against his own, "asking them to swim with me like you tried to get me to. Undressing in front of them, standing there in my panties like you tried to do to me that first time at the river?" She rubbed her pelvis against his hips again, "circling them like a shark.~" * - Wed Nov 18 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose her brow and stopped moving to lower down over him with a palm spread out on the grass on either side of his head and her nose touching his nose with her bright red eyes staring into his dark set. Whispering out, "and why is that?"* - Wed Nov 18 10:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes at what he said, she knew it was possible for him to do such a thing... hell her body was tiny enough she could be put in bed for a week by him likely. Her hips resisted lightly to his shifting but she wasn't able to stop him from forcing her to rub her pantie covered pussy lips against his crotch. "What do I have to do so that ... that doesn't happen? Heh?" She gave  nervous chuckle.* - Wed Nov 18 10:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow as her hips fully stopped, "Oooooh, I'm -ma'am- now?" * - Wed Nov 18 10:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her lip and thought about what he said and then shook her head and leaned in a tiny bit more to kiss him softly. "I prefer to call you, Sir."* - Wed Nov 18 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Even if I could put you in your place, and trust that I will in the future.~ I still would prefer to call you Sir. - Wed Nov 18 10:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gave a tiny groan at his warm hands touching her cool rump from wearing a skirt in the autumn weather. With another kiss given she then rose her head up and looked into his eyes before forcing the eyes to revert to her natural color. "Shouldn't we probably train, Sensei?"* - Wed Nov 18 10:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) inhaled slow and deep as her eyes closed at the sensation he might touch her tiny pucker. "Which last time, Sir? When I was trying to learn Kai in the courtyard? When we were on the couch and you were teaching me how a doctor gives a 'proper' exam... or when we were on the couch the time before and you were discussing with me what we should progress forward with my training. Fuuinjutsu in particularly you were interested in... but really interested in my interest for scouting.~"* - Wed Nov 18 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shuddered faintly and reopened her eyes as she tried to focus on what he was saying. Already a heat was forming between her thighs and she squirmed a small amount but tried to hold still so he could have his fun and she'd be a 'good girl' for him. "You told me that I needed to fully concentrate on the -flow- not the sections of my chakra strain. Shut it off all at one time or else I just end up over exerting myself. T-then you said if I leave it off too long I'll pass out... or possibly die." She swallowed hard and terrible thoughts crossed her mind at her being passed out in his presence forcing a tiny moan out as her chin rose a small amount and she continued to stare down towards him. "That's about all I remember, Sir."* - Wed Nov 18 11:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Oh he -has- to be kidding. - Wed Nov 18 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Out of -all- the jutsu in the world. - Wed Nov 18 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: THIS ONE? - Wed Nov 18 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: NOW? - Wed Nov 18 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I win. - Wed Nov 18 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes screamed panic as he was brushing his finger over her tight button. Biting down on her inner cheek she nodded to his demands and tried to hold her hips as still as possible so he wouldn't put too much pressure on her rump and just continue to tease her delicate wrinkles. Forming the handseal she closed her eyes but that only made her focus on his touch more so she reopened her eyes. Inhaling heavy in and out, Eri attempted to shut off her chakra but couldn't do it the first time because of her utter lack of concentration.* - Wed Nov 18 11:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Go a head. - Wed Nov 18 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: One more time. Concentrate. - Wed Nov 18 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded slowly and she was happy he wasn't moving his finger anymore. She felt her chakra out and formed the single seal while hovering over him. Eri could feel her chakra suddenly shut off but she was having difficulty turning it back on again to keep rotating. Her concentration was being broken by her distractions of his fingers and hand on her ass cheek. Without another moment's passing, Eri felt her eyes begin to flutter and she started to lean forward and falling against his chest as she passed out. Her lips slightly parted and likely her body had pulled away from his grip on her ass and the touch of her pucker from falling forward so hard, at least she wasn't going to knock the breath out of Ortho since she was so light weight.* - Wed Nov 18 11:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) doesn't wake up because the first thing Ortho should have done was release her chakra.* - Wed Nov 18 11:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was shifted back and forth from his rubbing her back and trying to wake her. Her chakra was back in play so she wasn't going to die or anything but she wasn't waking up either, her body became more and more lax and her heart rate slowed to a sleeping rest.* - Wed Nov 18 11:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's breathing brushed warmth against his chest as he rubbed against her tight pucker that was considerably less tense than it had been when she was awake and fully aware of what he was theatening to do. Something about that area made it impossibly to fully relax when you were conscious, especially with a new person who you weren't sure knew what they were doing with that area. For now... she couldn't be more relaxed against his body but slowly her rump was staring to lower since her knee's were slipping against the grass from her dead weight being atop his body.* - Wed Nov 18 11:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) slowly started to wake up after he had shifted her body, if not only that, him entering her certainly woke her up. She opened her eyes fully but was groggy from her chakra network having been on for a short amount of time. "Nngng?" then she felt the stimulation kicking in and moaned a deep rumble against his chest as she rubbed her face against his shirt. "Mngng.." her lower back arched and she wasn't sure what was going on entirely but the last thing she remembered she was trying to perform a jutsu and then here he was with his finger inside of her most delicate orfices. Toes curled inside of her boots and she shuddered against him as she felt her heart beat pick up and her breathing became heavy with lust just from a simple finger moving in and out of her so slowly... who knew it would get to her so easily.* - Wed Nov 18 11:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) squealed lightly at the coolness of saliva against the rim of her pucker and squeezed a little tighter before trying to relax again. She felt tingles all through her lower half and was still rubbing her cheek and hands against his shirt and upper body. Mumbling out in a groggy tone, "I gotta train, I gotta keep training, S-sir.. mgnng... feel so g-good...." she shuddered again with a tiny moan sounding as she tried to stay on focus that she needed to train. Too often lately they had been focused on sex instead of her training and she was trying her best to allow him to have the best of both of those worlds.* - Wed Nov 18 11:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wiggled as he was removing the finger, she didn't want him to fully remove it but when he did and he started to massage the exterior she was satisfied. Then he went and removed it entirely! A low whine sounded as she looked up to him and then felt herself being adjusted to sit up and atop his bulge with her skirt pretty hiked up by this point from all the fooling around. Shifting atop his lap she listened to his lesson and watched the handseals but she could still feel the cool saliva on her pucker drying so terribly slowly. 

Squirming a bit more she nodded to his instructions when they were complete and started to form the handseals. She focused her chakra into her hand and then put her hand above their heads so it would blow straight up so that they were both safe and weren't going to be pushed apart or potentially cut if she accidentally formed a slice rather than a gust. Another squirm had her shifting trying to feel even his pants rub against her ass again as she emitted only a small gust of wind from her hands and then went right back to forming seals again. Every so often she continued to shift on his lap with no luck of her pucker touching anything but air but her pussy was soaking through her panties now from all the rubbing.* - Wed Nov 18 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shuddered as he gripped her ass cheeks again, she was trying to squirm so that his finger tips got closer and closer to her crack and to the pucker he had left so lonely but it was no use, he was determined to keep his hands on her curves. Nodding a few times with a hard swallow she shifted so that she wasn't facing him entirely but so that she could direct the attack towards the tree nearby to disrupt the branches like a strong wind. She folded her hands into the seals all while tensing her cheeks and catching some of the cloth of his pants between her ass cheeks before relaxing again atop his lap. After she had formed the necessary amount of chakra within her lungs it manipulated to include fuuton nature and her lips formed a small 'o' that grew larger and larger as she blew out. At first nothing happened, it was just as if she was trying to blow hot air, eventually though the branches rustled before blowing fully in a haphazard way in strain. The tree groaned and small cracks could be heard as tiny branches broke off and fell to the ground, not to mention a good amount of leaves fluttering out of the branches to the forest floor.* - Wed Nov 18 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) could have kissed his feet in thanks at him finally stroking down her crack and resting on the slightly reddened pucker from attention. She could hear little bubble pops and squeaks from her wet juices mucking up their clothing and it only made her groan out a little longer. As he explained the next bit that would be relatively easy... it was pretty much the same thing with breaks between bursts and more concentrated. Forming the handseals he had shown she inhaled as deeply as she could manage and began to flow the chakra into her lungs. 

She took a moment to enjoy the finger that simply sat still on her asshole and shuddered again before blowing little orbs of wind chakra into the air above them. Watching them dissipate one by one overhead as she tried to focus to prepare the next one to release. All these jutsu were relatively easy for her to learn due to her determined attitude and self disapline.... not to mention the disapline that Ortho was teaching her on concentration deserved a medal.* - Wed Nov 18 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) could tell he wasn't going to give her another jutsu lesson for now and simply held still as he licked over his finger and rubbed at the wrinkled rim. As the saliva was rubbed across the exterior she felt her eyes fluttering closed for a moment before reopening so she could look him in the eye and was trying her best to look like she was in control. "Thank you, Sensei," breathy lust spoke out as she bit back a moan from him sinking inside of her wanting backside. 

She tried to think of something to say but was troubled on forming words for a moment and so just stared down at him with her fingers twitching every so often, a shudder here and there, "do I make you happy, Sir? I-is there um... is there any other rules you want to add? We only have one so far, Sir." She strained to hold still and had to grind her hips against his crotch just once to feed a much stronger itch growing.* - Wed Nov 18 13:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was about to reply even through all her grinding and soft breathes but then she chuckled and looked down to him with more awareness, "but you are inside of me, Sensei.~"* - Wed Nov 18 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down hard on her lip at the pressure of his hot and hard shaft. "What about... both, Sir? I can... I can try to do both... I can be a good girl while you fill me and t-teach me... I... I can hold still for you... Nngn.." She was already getting far more than hot and bothered at the idea of sitting on his lap, completely still, while being filled to the base with his cock and learning a lesson like a good girl.* - Wed Nov 18 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt adrenline rush through her as she heard the zipper and felt his cock slap against the front of her sex. "Nng..." she clenched and relaxed her fists as she tried to hold it together. Reaching up to grip onto his shoulders she helped lift herself up and watched him as he rubbed his head against her clit and dripping pussy lips. 

As soon as he started to sink into her she clenched tightly for a moment before relaxing but held her breath and shuddered hard and it only continued as he sank all the way in until her belly bulged some from his girth. As he had managed to sink all the way down into her she had only caught about half of what he said as she was now fully leaned against him with her upper body. Her lips agape and pressed against part of his neck as she panted out and trembled. "I.. I think I need you to repeat that, Sensei.... I'm such a bad girl, I wasn't paying very good att-attention when you were speaking." Her pussy clenched tightly about his cock and a tiny moan slipped from both the intense pressure filling her and the pleasure associated with it.* - Wed Nov 18 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) hadn't honestly expected him to be so intrusive with her behind but it only made her cling to him and moan a bit louder than any of her previous pleasured sounds. When he forced her to bounce up and down she was too filled with lust to resist kissing and giving a small lick to his neck. "F-forgive me, Sensei... I just... I just.. I'll try... I will... I'll try so s-so hard this time... Nngng... I'm sorrieee." She sounded pathetic in a lustful way and it was obvious how easily he was working her to his wants and demands.

She tried to clear her mind but every time he moved her up and down it became harder and harder to focus. She was going to pay extra attentiont his time to what he said though... yeah... she was going to focus and learn something else... right?* - Wed Nov 18 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded several times at what he said and then she tried to lean back so she was sitting up away from his chest but that only made her dizzy because of it shifting his cock inside of her. "Ouh... fuuu---" she shook her head trying to get her wits about her. Folding her hands into seals she pointed her hand out to the side with it bouncing up and down at a slow pace from him moving her body and curved her fingers slightly as the wind began to fly out. It was sloppy and didn't work out all that well so she cursed it and clenched her fist before trying again.

Forming the handseals quickly she then thrust her hand out with a scream of irritation at her having to focus on two things at once that were so concentration filled. Her fingers curved and then the wind tornadoes were thrust out as they tore off a small low hanging branch from the tree North of them. 

Panting heavily she looked up towards him with puppy dog eyes, "I can't do anymore, Sensei. I can't I'm just... I can't focus... ngng... I need... I need it.. Nngn.." She pressed her chest against his own and started to kiss his neck and tug at the soft skin with her suctioned lips and tongue trying to form hickies from her desire for him. She didn't ride him harder but let him control her hips since he was the 'sensei'. "I'll try to be good and listen to you if you want to talk to me but I can't use anymore chakra, I just can't concentrate on it. ITS TOO HARD NOW, S-sir... ngngng."* - Wed Nov 18 14:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down on his neck lightly as his finger inside of her ass started to plunge deeper and at a faster pace. The smacking between them created a loud echo through the area over the water and through the tree's making her ears go numb to anything other than the sound of their fucking. Moans slipped past her lips and it only took him a few deep drops of her cunt against his cock to get Eri to climax. Digging fingers into his back and holding onto his shirt she screamed against his collar bone while biting down hard on his bone and flesh trying to keep it together. 

"I-if you call this punishment, S-sir. I can't wait to see when I get rewarded for being good. Aren't I suppose to not -enjoy- punishment?" She whined out the words but there was cockiness behind them since this truly wasn't even close to any type of punishment she could imagine. By this point her panties had ripped from all the movement and her skirt was now being caked in white from her juices drying on the ruffles.* - Wed Nov 18 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gasped out as he fucked harder and honestly she had never been fucked this hard before. She always chosen men on the shorter side so she could control their interaction perfectly but he was driving it home currently and she was like a rag doll bouncing on top of his lap. The finger stretching her out and pumping inside of her had reached a point that she was going to orgasm in a new way she hadn't before. She never trusted anyone else to touch her ass before... but she had done so privately in the past for teasing reasons but nothing as far as what he was doing now... for all intensive purposes she was doing -amazingly- well for having her ass finger fucked while being rammed by someone so much larger than her. Kissing his neck and wrapping her arms around the back of his neck she couldn't do much else but hold on as a second, much larger, orgasm burst out and sent her into glorious climaxing screams.* - Wed Nov 18 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) panted against his neck and kissed and held onto him as her orgasm died off. As he toyed with her outer lips and clit a shudder was released here and there but she remained mostly still for him as her breathing slowed. His order was heard and she nodded hesitantly and then quickly before trying to raise up with a gasp off of him from their two sexes causing a suction. "Nng.." She had been waiting for this position since they became intimate...she loved it but was honestly scared of experiencing it with him since he was so much larger. She twisted over and got on her hands and knees on the grass and reached back to pull her skirt up so that her ripped panties and ass were high in the air as she could get them while leaning forward so he would be going in deep, that is if he event re-entered her cunt.* - Wed Nov 18 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes as soon as she realized what he was going to do. Her body instantly began to shake in worry of if he messed up, if he wasn't careful, if he tore her open even... She looked back over her shoulder with scared eyes but still curious in a way and bit down on her lip nodding slowly. "I understand, Sensei." She lowered her head and upper chest to the ground so she was trying to be as relaxed as possible in this position as he worked his head against her ass.

At first she had tensed up a bit so it would take a little work to get her relaxed like she was with his finger. After a good ten minutes of in and out pressing his head likely would finally slip past the initial rim making her gasp out loudly and bracing with her fingers digging into the grass and then dirt to try and hold still and keep it together. As he forced the head in she felt her eyes watering because it -did- hurt a little but it felt good and foreign.. heated.. hot... tingly. Lower lip trembled and she tried to take slow steady breathes in through her nostrils and out past her lips. Doing fairly well all things considered for what he had decided her punishment was, she was a little bit worried about him going any deeper though and was preparing herself for it knowing it would hurt much more than feel good... Right after the head had entered there was always that little relaxation of the rim tightening around the underside of the curved edge of the tip.* - Wed Nov 18 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) had her teeth clenched to the point of gritting. Huffing out breathes as her eyes eventually watered up enough for tears to fall but only out of natural bodily reaction. She was trembling quite severely but kept nodding to him every so often to show it was alright. Besides the pain he was sending jolts of pleasure through her body and her pussy was dripping clear and white juices from her orgasm in little drops every so often from her clit after having run down the length of her cleft. 

Her eyes slowly opened and closed as she wondered if he was going to go further now after having sank in and out of her with just the head but she knew full well she couldn't handle it. Her fingers eased up on the grass and dirt to rest atop the foilage and she tried to relax fully but her tiny body needed more than relaxing, it needed training.* - Wed Nov 18 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) jumped when he had swatted her ass and she actually -shook- fully and looked back at him with utter terror in her eyes for a moment. She told herself it was fine...that everything was okay, whispering to herself even as she felt cold but then he had pulled out of her ass and was switching to her pussy once again. As he started to slam into her she had managed to push the slaps out of her mind and focused on his movements in the moment. She was worried he was going to cum in her again in all honesty and was worried that he might not actually care if he came in her again because there was already the possibility that she was pregnant. When he started to enlarge further she had to muster up a weak whisper, "Not inside, Ortho."

She didn't say anything else and didn't even know if he heard her or not, her body was really just taking the motions with panting as she tried to keep her mind away from bad thoughts for the last portion of their sexual endeavors.* - Wed Nov 18 15:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) could feel her insides heating back up, wanted or not. With him thrusting in and out of her it was undeniable for her to get back into the groove of things and soon enough a soft moan sounded and her pussy reacted by squeezing down tightly around his cock. After all the hard banging she had taken, both of her holes were extremely swollen and tight, not to mention red. Even her outer pussy lips were swelled slightly from all the slapping and were a nice hot pink color.* - Wed Nov 18 15:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's cheeks were red for certain, as well as her chest and neck not only from their sex but from rubbing against the grass for so long. She was going to have to end up undressing and tossing her current clothing and cleaning up in the river and -hope- that Ortho had an extra change of clothing. She rolled onto her side after all of the cum had spread out over her ass and lower back. Staring out towards the small sand bar of the river and feeling him pulling in behind her to rest and catch his breath. She said nothing for now and simply let him hold her. She wondered if he had seen her look or caught on to what bothered her, she didn't want to say anything until his high was entirely gone.* - Wed Nov 18 16:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't stop him from turning her head but her eyes looked lost in bad thoughts as she peered up towards him and then closed her eyes for the kiss. When he broke it and was stroking over her cheek she whispered with her eyes still closed. "It's not your fault, I should have told you...about all that."* - Wed Nov 18 16:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) leaned her head in against his chest but then sighed heavily at his words and pushed back with her hands gently to look up towards him. "No, just... I need to learn to enjoy those things, okay? I've never ... let anyone do those things because of my past but when you held my arm down that first time I wanted to let you because I -liked- how it felt and that scared the hell out of me. When you slapped me though it just sort of was shocking and brought me out of my vibe really fast... maybe if we introduce some of those things while we aren't having sex it would help? I need to get over my past...and maybe this can help... after all it's not like there might not be cases in the future where an opponent might try something similar to holding me down or the like and I'd like to not panic."* - Wed Nov 18 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head and crumpled her brow, "I can sort of tell you've never had to deal with a situation like this before... you couldn't even begin to understand how I would react and holding me down is a lot different than a little slap. I could have been nervous about a person I hardly knew holding me down for security reasons but this time you love me, and I trust you, so clearly something was wrong. We should have spoken on this earlier... I just have never told anyone."* - Wed Nov 18 16:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded slowly and stayed silent a long momet before whispering, "You aren't curious what happened?"* - Wed Nov 18 16:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: It's easier to talk about it now.... then later. - Wed Nov 18 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Then talk to me.. I'm here whenever. - Wed Nov 18 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes and inhaled and exhaled deeply. "Can you imagine the worst abuse possible... nigh rape?"* - Wed Nov 18 16:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded some at least understanding of his honesty, some people probably would have at least tried to imagine the scene. "Since I can remember, it's my earliest memory in fact... my parents, as a team would beat me... they'd degrade me... they would starve me... not give me water to drink... leave me locked in a shed sometimes.. a closet... my father was the worst but my mother used to hold me down for him. They'd laugh and mock me... they'd humiliate me on purpose and I was their entertainment... always was. I still loved them for some reason, I don't understand how I did love them now but they had to have hated me to do all those things to me. The only thing I can say is they never raped me... I was worried it was going to get to that point and it's one of the reasons I killed them at such a young age. I told you I was plotting there death's since I was twelve and that was true... It was so bad they had to 'homeschool' me but really I got no education from them other than trying to do what they said so that they wouldn't hurt me." 

She was trembling and tears fell down her cheeks as she spoke, "They never used weapons at least... that's why you don't find many scars on my body but I'm so short because of all the bones I had broken growing up." She sighed heavily and tried to wipe away her tears. "I don't want to really go into the humiliating things they made me do so I'll leave it there..."* - Wed Nov 18 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sniffled as he wiped her tears and she pressed her cheek in against his chest and closed her eyes. "They're dead now, it's over. I'll heal, I always have."* - Wed Nov 18 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked up to his face and could see how mad he was, "Should I not have told you?"* - Wed Nov 18 17:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No t's not tha... - Wed Nov 18 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's something.. I wish didn't have to experience. - Wed Nov 18 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I got something to tell you, Sir. - Thu Nov 19 08:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm? - Thu Nov 19 08:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What's that? - Thu Nov 19 08:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Gotta tell you in private. - Thu Nov 19 08:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Or at least whispered, Sir. - Thu Nov 19 08:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: So that red headed girl that has an attitude. - Thu Nov 19 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I -might- have gone to Kirigakure to spy at some point. - Thu Nov 19 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: She was there. - Thu Nov 19 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Soon as she saw me? She demanded I leave openly in public. - Thu Nov 19 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Removed her weapon and everything demanding I leave. - Thu Nov 19 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: She also said something along the lines of telling you to go fuck yourself. - Thu Nov 19 08:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Red head female? - Thu Nov 19 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Describe her.. - Thu Nov 19 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Yeah the one that thought I was eavesdropping? - Thu Nov 19 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..... - Thu Nov 19 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: That you were arguing after coming back from the fight. - Thu Nov 19 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Kana? - Thu Nov 19 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I guess, I don't know her name. - Thu Nov 19 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Skimpy clothes? - Thu Nov 19 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Bra? - Thu Nov 19 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Panties? - Thu Nov 19 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Yes....I hit on her to distract her from the fact that she thought I was eavesdropping that one time. - Thu Nov 19 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: She didn't like me hitting on her but it shut her up. - Thu Nov 19 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ........ - Thu Nov 19 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I told her I was there to get sushi, which wasn't a total lie. - Thu Nov 19 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I did want some good sushi. - Thu Nov 19 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: So.. You went to Kirigakure.. to spy.. and sushi.. - Thu Nov 19 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: .....yes. - Thu Nov 19 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Was acknowledged and threatened..? - Thu Nov 19 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Only by her. - Thu Nov 19 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: The entire village dies in a few days. - Thu Nov 19 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: The people from Kiri didn't give a shit about my presence. - Thu Nov 19 08:17:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: she also openly called you my boyfriend which I denied of course. - Thu Nov 19 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: After I got her name off of the bounty list too? - Thu Nov 19 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..tch. - Thu Nov 19 08:18:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I made sure to add her name in the delivery too.. - Thu Nov 19 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Kirigakure.. as a whole was fine..? - Thu Nov 19 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Just her was acting up, right? - Thu Nov 19 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Yeah a guy there even was like 'why you gotta make her leave like that?' - Thu Nov 19 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: And then he ran off before I left, I think he was scared of her. - Thu Nov 19 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Very well then. - Thu Nov 19 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I'm not trying to like get her killed or anything for being a cunt, you do you. - Thu Nov 19 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shrugged.* - Thu Nov 19 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I don't care what you decide, I was told to pass on the message of 'fuck you'. - Thu Nov 19 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: There were more fancy words than that but I can't recall. - Thu Nov 19 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I don't desire her life. No matter how  much of a.. bitch.. she is. - Thu Nov 19 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I can't lie though, this is a minor set back. - Thu Nov 19 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Because she clearly isn't allied to you? - Thu Nov 19 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Well.. let's hope it remain- - Thu Nov 19 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: No. Because your face has been seen in Kirigakure and identified as someone who knows me. - Thu Nov 19 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ...she didn't say your name. - Thu Nov 19 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I wouldn't put it past her. - Thu Nov 19 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: She just said 'him' 'your boyfriend'. - Thu Nov 19 08:27:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Did you manage to get your sushi or did you leave after speaking with her? - Thu Nov 19 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: No she made me leave instantly, I had only just got there too. - Thu Nov 19 08:34:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I might squash all beef I have with Kirigakure soon. - Thu Nov 19 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It's becoming pointless. - Thu Nov 19 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Why are you on bad terms with them anyhow? - Thu Nov 19 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Several accounts of using my name as a host for their blame on certain things. Torturing me when I first graduated from the academy as a Genin.. Locking me in prison for not wanting to supply them with my hard earned money. - Thu Nov 19 08:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Little by little, Mizukage after Mizukage, they've all attempted to continue the trend of getting me killed. - Thu Nov 19 08:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Thu Nov 19 08:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: All because I took out their two prized shinobi in a two on one fight. - Thu Nov 19 08:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Do you ever train? Can I help? - Thu Nov 19 09:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: With the amount of fights I get into, training isn't necessary. - Thu Nov 19 09:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ...right. - Thu Nov 19 09:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Then you can train me more. - Thu Nov 19 09:05:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: You need to come up with the village symbol. - Thu Nov 19 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I don't really want to 'recruite' people. It'd only make them conflicted between loyalty to Shinkogakure or their original home. - Thu Nov 19 09:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: This place is meant for refugees that seek peace and serenity. - Thu Nov 19 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Not people that only came because it sounded cool. - Thu Nov 19 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Mn.... - Thu Nov 19 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: He's a die-hard Konohagakure shinobi.. - Thu Nov 19 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Then why is he here? - Thu Nov 19 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Well...all of us are die hards for Konoha really... - Thu Nov 19 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Yet he's here because he sees the difference between the village system and free will here. - Thu Nov 19 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: But Konoha failed us. - Thu Nov 19 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..Exactly. - Thu Nov 19 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: The headband thing. - Thu Nov 19 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: That needs settled. - Thu Nov 19 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: What does shinko mean anyway. - Thu Nov 19 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Progression. - Thu Nov 19 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: So a symbol? - Thu Nov 19 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Haven't thought about that much. - Thu Nov 19 09:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Never thought there'd be a reason for it either. I feel like just claiming the village alone and showing loyalty is enough of a representation of Shinkogakure.. - Thu Nov 19 09:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Headbands or.. tattoos.. is you personally going the extra mile. - Thu Nov 19 09:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I will get some headbands made though.. - Thu Nov 19 09:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thought about it for a good solid half a minute before nodding.* - Thu Nov 19 09:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Nevermind, you are right. - Thu Nov 19 09:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I want.... to get a tattoo. - Thu Nov 19 09:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..You sure..? - Thu Nov 19 09:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I want to get one for Konoha and Shink... together. - Thu Nov 19 09:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: *Shinko - Thu Nov 19 09:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: With flames around them. - Thu Nov 19 09:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Yeah... - Thu Nov 19 09:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You know it actually hurts, right? - Thu Nov 19 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..well.. - Thu Nov 19 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ....no shit? - Thu Nov 19 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I have high toler- - Thu Nov 19 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Just saying, just saying. - Thu Nov 19 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: You act like I can't endure pain. - Thu Nov 19 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked up at him seriously.* - Thu Nov 19 09:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You act like I want there to be any pain you have to endure. - Thu Nov 19 09:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: A tattoo isn't that bad, no worse than my peircings. - Thu Nov 19 09:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I'll just get you wasted before you get the tattoo. - Thu Nov 19 09:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: No, that's bad. - Thu Nov 19 09:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Makes you bleed more. - Thu Nov 19 09:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: We can smoke some bud. - Thu Nov 19 09:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I know something else I want on the tattoo. - Thu Nov 19 09:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I think I want the symbol of Konoha to be on a kunai, and the kanji for progression to be on a hammer. Cross them over each other, with fire in the background. Minimal color, maybe just some oranges and reds. - Thu Nov 19 09:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Make the kunai worn out, and the hammer new. - Thu Nov 19 09:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: There we go. What do you think? - Thu Nov 19 09:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: That's.. impressive - Thu Nov 19 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..Real.. impressive. - Thu Nov 19 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You just thought this up? - Thu Nov 19 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Yep. - Thu Nov 19 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..Let's go. - Thu Nov 19 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Now? - Thu Nov 19 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Time to.. uh.. train.. - Thu Nov 19 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Uh, sure. - Thu Nov 19 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: ...oh. - Thu Nov 19 09:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I have plenty for ninjutsu to teach you.. - Thu Nov 19 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Train... or 'train'? - Thu Nov 19 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: They are kind of blurring together. - Thu Nov 19 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Seriously train.. while maybe.. 'train'. Depends on what you're in the mood for. - Thu Nov 19 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded and waited for him to lead the way.* - Thu Nov 19 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Nice and open.. no trees. - Thu Nov 19 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) listened attentively as she always did unless he was distracting her too severely. Eri's eyes trained in on what he was showing and she reached her finger up to her mouth and bit down on it, in that moment she thought of an idea. "We should develop some sort of finger prick that goes on your thump so that you can prick your finger quickly without it being seen, lifting your hand to your mouth is a bit too ... obvious that you are going to summon something." 

She then rolled up her sleeve and smeered a line of blood thinly over her left arm and inhaled deeply before sighing out and beginning to channel her chakra through her body. She was gathering it up inside of her and visualizing the serpent's cave as she tried to welcome them to enter her arm and flow out. This of course did not go very well as this jutsu was a little too difficult for her to complete at the moment. She felt a pressure in her arm and it was like snakes were trying to -litterally- crawl out of her arm. Gritting teeth she looked down to see their tongues and heads squirming out of her arm as if they were inside of her flesh and she groaned and then surpressed a scream as she gripped just below her elbow with her right hand and tried to shut off the chakra being flowed for the summon.* - Thu Nov 19 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) grumbled at her failure, "I want to keep trying, Sir... I can get it... I promise." She looked down at her arm but could tell it was going to take a lot of practice for her to get that jutsu down and was going to have to practice alone to get it instead of making him wait. 

Watching him display the wire technique she rose a brow and wondered where exactly the wires were coming from. "Are you summoning the wires from somewhere? Or do you have them hidden?" She was looking him over in speculation.* - Thu Nov 19 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) frowned slightly but nodded and folded her hands into the seals. She tried it out several times since she didn't really know her focus from where to pull the wires from but eventually got the hang of it and ended up at some point accidentally shooting them at Ortho. "Er----" shutting her eyes tightly as she realized her mistake even in all this open area. "S-sorrie..." She tried to start messing with the wires to get him unbound if he hadn't moved.* - Thu Nov 19 10:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) blinked at him being scared almost, "...you act like I'm going to hurt you." She was carefully and slowly managed to untangle him from the wires before they fell to the ground. Clearly she had the skill down just needed some fine tuning.* - Thu Nov 19 10:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded and stood back after the wires had laid still on the grass. "What now?"* - Thu Nov 19 10:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Was it Genjutsu she said she didn't want or Fuuinjutsu..? - Thu Nov 19 10:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) watched his hands and ignored the fact he was nervous a second ago. She mimicked the handseals and then tried to emplore the genjutsu out from her mind reaching into his to force whatever enemy he might be scared of. She focused all of her ability to control his mind out but she wasn't the most intellectual based honestly. It likely would somewhat leak into his mind but it certainly wasn't strong enough for him to believe it was real, just honestly see the illusion around the two of them.* - Thu Nov 19 11:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) heard what he said but when she was about to perform the handseals she froze. "I don't want to force something like that onto you, Sir." She was conflicted on whether or not to continue but practiced the handseals without actually activating the chakra directed towards Ortho. She did however activate the chakra out in practice but it lacked a target so no illusion was formed.* - Thu Nov 19 11:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: ? - Thu Nov 19 11:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was pretty warmed up now so going back to the higher level stuff would probably be doable. She yawned slightly and then rubbed her face from all the chakra usage she was having to du but luckily her chakra wasn't terrible. She still had blood along her arm so she didn't need to redo that part of the bit. Focusing her chakra through her left arm her eyes closed and she felt out the energy flowing through her body and beginning to focus into her arm.

Taking a deep sigh, Eri felt her connection to the serpent caves and used that connection to pull only one or two snakes from the other side to this location. Licking over her lips as her concentration enhanced further, she could feel herself being pulled deeper and deeper into the jutsu as the serpents were spawned and circled about her arm in harmony. 

She wasn't sure what to do after that and looked over towards Ortho. "What now?" since he hadn't informed her what to do.* - Thu Nov 19 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rubbed her lips together and found it strange to telepathically connect with the snakes. She flowed her chakra through them and from herself as an extension as the serpents moved forward after having peered up towards Eri and then over towards Ortho and began to slowly slither mid air while being wrapped about her arm towards the man. With a quick action they darted forward and became longer and thicker until they had constricted about his body with one of the heads low next to his thigh and the other up by his ear as they tightened their muscles about his body to the level of control she could manage to constrict, but it was likely bearable for Ortho to stand.* - Thu Nov 19 12:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) forced the snakes back and they retracted after uncoiling. Staying out of her arm and wrapped about her arm as one of them looked up to her and she reached a knuckle up to rub gently at the underbelly of the one looking towards her. She then looked over towards Ortho, clearly she enjoyed the serpents more than he normally treated them. "Do you ever feed them?" she wondered if that was a thing, she sort of felt bad that the only time the snakes were brought out was for training or fighting.* - Thu Nov 19 12:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) made soft whispy clicking noises with her tongue towards the snake and it flicked it's tongue to taste the air. She released the two snakes and allowed them to go down to the river to hunt. To her there was nothing wrong with this at all. "You should feed them more often, maybe your giant serpent would be more kind." The way Manda spoke to him had not gone on false ears in the past.* - Thu Nov 19 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow towards him, she was standing directly beside him after all. "So all of his comments towards you are just little stabs at your wry humor between each other? If you say so...."* - Thu Nov 19 12:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I see. - Thu Nov 19 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I won't question it anymore. - Thu Nov 19 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Obviously hiding something. - Thu Nov 19 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right, right. - Thu Nov 19 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) called the serpents back and they crawled up her leg before into her arm and back to their cave. They were moving considerably slower than before after catching rodents down by the water's edge.* - Thu Nov 19 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: What is it? - Thu Nov 19 12:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just thinking. - Thu Nov 19 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) slowly sleuthed closer and wrapped her arms around his hips to lock her fingers together to hold him with hips against her lower belly from how much taller he was. "And what would you be thinking about?"* - Thu Nov 19 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow, "do you want to tell me about that stuff? I will be a good girl and listen as you speak. I will even keep my opinions to myself.~" She bit down on her lip slightly as if to promise on her silence before releasing it. "I am your student after all, sometimes I have to listen to your lectures and simply sit there silently."* - Thu Nov 19 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) lowered her eyes as she heard what he said, her promise not to speak her opinions was something she wished she hadn't said now. When he spoke of her she rose her head to look up at him curiously. Canting her head to the side some wondering what he meant about her.* - Thu Nov 19 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) twitched her lips to the side, "Are you certain?"* - Thu Nov 19 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I am. - Thu Nov 19 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Let me hear it. - Thu Nov 19 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rubbed her lips together and then licked between them. She pursed them soon after and spoke up, "you shouldn't send any of your shinobi to Sunagakure.... it might very well be a trap. Either you could be tracked back to your settlement and it's wherabouts become known. Then there is the fact that past chuunin exams have gone very wrong and it could just end up that kage's use this exam to kill off your excelling forces. If you feel like not allowing your shinobi to participate in a means of excelling in rank is hindering them, then come up with your own ranking system that is different than the other villages. Create your own way of determining who is to raise in rank..." She paused and then moved on to the next topic.

"As for Kumogakure, Sunagakure owns that village...it's still risky to go there but not as badly as the Sunagakure itself. If Sunagakure really is aiding Kirigakure then they very well may be your enemies as well. You should be careful how you go about all this. Kumogakure may be your best best though, as for alligning with the remaining Konoha forces who do not wish to come to the settlement, I believe that to be a good move. Course I don't see Konoha or Kumogakure rebuilding any time soon. Kumogakure is more likely with the backing of Sunagakure."* - Thu Nov 19 13:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) listened to what he said and lowered her head some, "you trust him quite a bit it seems even for how weak he is. I didn't think he had the intellect to go sneaking about in foreign villages."* - Thu Nov 19 13:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I see... - Thu Nov 19 13:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Will you ever find something for me to do like that? - Thu Nov 19 13:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Actually, yes. - Thu Nov 19 13:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Soon, very soon. - Thu Nov 19 13:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A few more techniques and I'll send you to Konohagakure. See if there any lingering shinobi there. - Thu Nov 19 13:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: What will I be doing? - Thu Nov 19 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Of course it's not as high stakes as Hatsujin's location.. but I know there are a few Sunagakure shinobi that linger there. - Thu Nov 19 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I basically want you to see how people of Konohagakure feel. - Thu Nov 19 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: See if their minds are swaying. - Thu Nov 19 13:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: From there, bring up Shinko. - Thu Nov 19 13:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Alright. - Thu Nov 19 13:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Listen. I have some meditation to do. Your training went great today and I'll.. reward.. you when I get back. - Thu Nov 19 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright? - Thu Nov 19 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded and released him. "I'll be back at the settlement, you can find me there."* - Thu Nov 19 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Always.~ - Thu Nov 19 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Atta girl.~ - Thu Nov 19 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) approached by caravan of course. She had on a black jacket with a hood pulled over her wavy hair and peircing covered face and ears, along with a touch of smokey make up. Her outfit consisted of a button up grey shirt with several studded areas on it, along with a black ruffled skirt and boots that looked like feminine style combatant boots. Her right hand had a wrist guard/guantlet that had the Konoha emblem upon it's metal and she had on sheer black stockings that stopped just an inch below the hem of her skirt because of the cooler weather. All things considered she was still far from dressed for weather that was up here in the mountains. After having arrived she realized this and shuddered as she stepped out of the caravan service and paid the wagon driver.* - Thu Nov 19 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was worried about the Sunagakure forces but she played it cool, which was easy enough for her. She did the henge check, all of her credentials for Konoha checked out (considering Konoha hasn't been taken care of it wasn't like she could have anything recently signed). As she made her way towards the nearest exit of the checkpoint she was stopped by the glaring from Eiyu. Pausing she rose her head and blinked a few times, "You're that guy, the scared one from Kirigakure." She wasn't concerned about him recognizing her, after all she had nothing to hide right? She was just a girl who traveled all the way to Kirigakure for some sushi.~* - Thu Nov 19 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was extremely lax in her gestures and stance. She even had her hands stuffed into her pockets with noticable fists of attempts to keep warm. She was shuddering occasionally also trying to keep warm in the cold and breezy air. Her toes were turned in against each other with her thighs pressed against each other as well. She lowered her head some with the hood still in place to be respectful, clearly he was about to interrogate her or something by how he was speaking. "Supaiku," giving her surname as that was part of her culture for formality reasons, it also served to keep people from knowing too much about you, a name holds power after all. "I come to the Land of Clouds to search for relations, I figured this land to be much more kind than that of The Land of Waves... I can't say I had a very good experience there."* - Thu Nov 19 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes quickly flicked to his foot and then back up to his eyes and a smile tugged at her lips. "Friendship comes in many packages."* - Thu Nov 19 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) blinked at him calling himself a 'humble servant'. She walked towards him slowly to show she meant no harm and stood a few feet away from him without fear of what he might do, after all he was blushing as red as a tomato. "What is your rank here in the Land of Clouds? I promise no harm will come to anyone or anything here in this village unless I am harmed. I have true intentions of good faith to be shown to this village, nothing negative." She didn't smile and she was pushing it with the respects since she really was quite a rude girl. If he was capable of telling when someone wasn't acting as they normally would he likely would be able to tell she was a bit off, but she was not lying to him.* - Thu Nov 19 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stopped instantly when he told her to and set her foot that was moving forward back one step next to the other and stood still. She found it rather amusing how hauty he was becoming over her asking questions and approaching him when she had stood next to him previously in Kirigakure. "I am but a curious shinobi, I wasn't aware asking for your rank was rude, nor did I think I need a reason to ask it. You asked of my name and yet did not give yur own, I passed the checkpoint yet you continue to question my reason for being here. I cannot ask why someone is so interested in a young girl such as myself?" She reached up and pulled her hood back so he could fully see her face but the hood was still able to protect her from the wind, at least about the ears. "I am but simply a genin of Konoha, but of course does that really mean all that much with Konoha in it's current state? I suppose you could say I'm not a shinobi at all."* - Thu Nov 19 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) crumpled her brow at the fact -he- was the leader. What was this world coming to that people like Liu, Eiyu, and Ortho were village leaders. She inhaled slowly and let out a gentle sigh that came out as a puff of steam into the air. "I see, I wasn't aware, Lord Raikage... you do seem rather young after all, course I should have been aware that age isn't a factor in leadership. Forgive me." She bowed her head respectfully towards him but it was obvious that all of this was forced on her part due to her true nature.* - Thu Nov 19 17:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) couldn't help but snicker at his comment of biting her tongue. She listened to his 'nindo' and nodded slowly. "Right well, my thoughts were not that you are not deserving but that I am being far more respectful than I normally might. In fact I gave you more information than I ever would simply in an attempt to be police... I really do not enjoy attempting that feat, it's boring." She twitched her nose and sniffled from the cold. 

"That is a rather odd name, 'Uie'. Anyhow, am I free to go now or am I your personal prisoner to look after while I am here, Mister Leader Boy." Her natural rudeness coming into play since he told her to let her tongue loose.* - Thu Nov 19 17:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) could tell he had taken a turn, she eyed him up and down curiously but the fact of the matter was she wasn't insulting him in the fact that his people didn't need him but it was interesting how quickly he had changed. She started to step closer to him again without a word.* - Thu Nov 19 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) kept walking towards him slow and calm with no sign of her going to attack.* - Thu Nov 19 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) kept walking until she was directly in front of him, only a foot between them. If he didn't stop her, if he kept moving backwards, she kept stepping forward.* - Thu Nov 19 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled gently up towards him, he was a giant compared to her when standing this close. "You could have struck me down, why didn't you? I was disobeying."* - Thu Nov 19 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded slowly towards him but shuddered again, "it shows a lot of character to know how you would react in that situation... considering you were already annoyed with me."* - Thu Nov 19 17:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked him over with a sly grin, "no, I think you are kind... considerate.... scared... lonely....there are other things too." She shrugged, "I can tell you have a quick temper, are curious, protective." She looked him over again. "If you are going to watch me like a hawk then can we get going? It is very...cold out here." She was still shuddering every so often and growing pale.* - Thu Nov 19 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rolled her eyes at him saying he wasn't scared and rubbed her arms as she scurried along trying to keep up with him. "I'm not going anywhere in particular, I suppose making relations with you is good enough for me...for now, if you don't disagree. Course you are the one that decided to watch me so closely." She smiled sweetly in a mocking way. "And ...yes it's much colder here than I was anticipating during my travels." * - Thu Nov 19 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was surprised he led her to a place to get food, she was hungry but she wasn't used to eating out all that often but was going to be kind about this and knew she was going to have to eat out since she didn't have a home in this region. "I can smile when I want, and that wasn't a real smile." She walked on quickly following after him and then spoke up again, "do you not like Sunagakure?"* - Thu Nov 19 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) had watched the entire display with wide eyes. After he had opened the menu all she had to ask was simple. "Do you view the people of this village as your family?"* - Thu Nov 19 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't really want food even if she was hungry since she wanted to stay on subject with the current topic. "Uh... Onigiri is fine, plum sauce." She then focused back on the male before her. "Is Sunagakure not aiding you? I saw the shinobi? How many of them are here anyhow? I mean if they are here I figured they would be helping you."* - Thu Nov 19 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) reached out for her cup of sake he had ordered for her and sipped it before sitting it back down and taking up an onigiri with her chopsticks and dipping it in the plum sauce. Eating it rather quickly and swallowing before speaking again, <god that feels so good, foooooood.> "Right well, I didn't mean to sound hasty in those questions. I'm curious because I thought that Sunagakure might have given you more aid than just shinobi to guard you. I thought Sunagakure owned this land?"* - Thu Nov 19 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow, "then when would you be willing to speak on it? It's a topic of interest for me, Kumogakure's well-being, that is." She took up another piece of onigiri and ate it before sipping her sake soon after.* - Thu Nov 19 18:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) hummed gently and leaned forward, "perhaps I plan to become an investor?"* - Thu Nov 19 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: *Chuckles* No, I dont want revenue of anykind from outside sources. You would have a stake in the village, and I would owe you. - Thu Nov 19 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Well I'm afraid I love the Land of Fire far too much to live here. - Thu Nov 19 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: But investor doesn't always mean money. - Thu Nov 19 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Will you not speak to me about these matters at all? Aren't you a bit curious as to why I am... so curious? - Thu Nov 19 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I am curious. - Thu Nov 19 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But that's also why I am defensive. - Thu Nov 19 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Ulterior motives are often bad. - Thu Nov 19 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Do you have ways of assuring that your village is safe from lil ol' me? - Thu Nov 19 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: If you have ways of assuring said safety, please do enact them. I will behave. - Thu Nov 19 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I haven't done anything against you other than disobey when you told me to stop walking. - Thu Nov 19 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It's not you I'm worried about. Though you are a concern as well. - Thu Nov 19 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Tell me. - Thu Nov 19 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Does your partner have the same vested 'interest' as you do? I do remember the girl who kicked you out making mention of him. - Thu Nov 19 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled gently and went back to her food, "Why do you think I am here?"* - Thu Nov 19 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Information. - Thu Nov 19 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...You missed the point of my rhetorical question. - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: No, I understood. - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You're here. - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Because he's interested. - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sighed and rubbed her temple.* - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Now listen.... - Thu Nov 19 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I came a very long way to speak to you. - Thu Nov 19 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: -You- in fact. - Thu Nov 19 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I didn't think it would be quite so easy to even -meet- you. - Thu Nov 19 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: For that matter, he didn't actually send me. Someone else was suppose to come but ... I sort of got antsy. - Thu Nov 19 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Needed something to do and I wanted to see your land. - Thu Nov 19 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Plus, I'm pretty sure you would like me far more than the other guy, I'm easy on the eyes. - Thu Nov 19 19:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked him over, "Unless you swing the other way."* - Thu Nov 19 19:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stared at him wide eyed and then absolutely CRUMBLED into laughter. She was in tears as she rest her head on the table and laughed a good solid five minutes.* - Thu Nov 19 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rolled her head over so only her cheek was on the table and then she had to wipe her tears away. "Oh man... whewwwwww... I haven't laughed like that in a while. He -definitely- couldn't intimidate you... the guy is a pansy. I think he's more of a charmer than I am, as for me being manipulative, I'm not trying to be. I'm attempting to be perfectly candid with you. I suppose I'm leaving a few details out but nothing that means I have ill intent. Do you trust that I don't mean harm for your village or you?"* - Thu Nov 19 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) remained quiet as he rose his voice in anger and she lowered her head and stared down at the table as she didn't speak or move. Her posture might even be noted as being submissive in nature, she wasn't going to try and get him anymore worked up than he already was, she didn't know his power and she wanted positive attitudes, not fighting.* - Thu Nov 19 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) kept her head down, "even if you turn us away we will not harm your village. You have done us no harm and so we will do you no harm. I'm sorry that the shinobi world has made you so cautious and wary of accepting friendship, it is quite the sad sight to see. Being from Konoha and through my experiences in the past I can understand your point of view, but I have grown from that point of view and out of the ...basic shinobi principles."* - Thu Nov 19 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) frowned gently and looked up to him, "so you won't even hear me out then?"* - Thu Nov 19 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: We'd like to become allies. - Thu Nov 19 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: We don't do things like normal shinobi villages. - Thu Nov 19 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Who is we? - Thu Nov 19 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't think I'm allowed to say that for now, I'm not even suppose to be here... like I said. - Thu Nov 19 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I'll very likely get in trouble. - Thu Nov 19 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hmmm... - Thu Nov 19 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: We mainly are a refuge for those who want freedom. - Thu Nov 19 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Freedom from the oppression that the shinobi world has created. - Thu Nov 19 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: We aren't anti shinobi in any way... many of us still consider ourselves shinobi. - Thu Nov 19 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) lifted her hand and sat it atop the table to show the Konoha headband woven into her gauntlet.* - Thu Nov 19 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was irritated by what he said because they were all assumptions. "You shouldn't make assumptions, nothing you just said was true at all." She shook her head and drank down the last of the sake in her glass with the gauntlet covered hand. "I did not betray my village, I do help Konoha quite often. The place that I live now is a refuge mainly for those from Konoha to help them live peacefully as Konoha is rebuilt. We go to Konoha often and assist them. For now though, Konoha has no kage and no leadership or organization. It honeslty became a battleground for the shinobi of other villages that needed an arena."

She stared up to him with her dark eyes, "I never said I wish to change the world. For now, in this moment, I wish to provide alliance to Kumogakure from where I live currently. A settlement of progression and peace, freedom and tranquility. If you don't accept then we will not bother you or harm you. I come to offer this because of the fact that I expected Sunagakure to take better care of this village after claiming it as their own but what I have seen is quite saddening... I also further want to ensure this alliance because I can tell you are an honest and gentle man... and I can see you becoming a great leader becuase of those facts." She stared down at the crumbs on her plate and the little bit of plum sauce left over. Reaching down with her finger and taking some up to suck it off the very end of her index. 

"What I want with your village has nothing to do with Konoha, I can promise that to you. I am doing a duty to the leader of the settlement who wishes to have an alliance with you. For what he wants that alliance I can't be sure but I know that his intentions are pure. He is a good man, and only seaks peace, despite what some might say about him." She fell silent then and waited.* - Thu Nov 19 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled warmly as she heard his words, ignoring that he was crying. There was no shame to her in crying, even if it showed the pain...she understood it's necessity at times. Lifting her head to peer up to him with a genuine warm behind her dark eyes and expression. "Thank you for the consideration, perhaps now we can simply visit and enjoy ourselves rather than me trying to push you to answer questions?"* - Thu Nov 19 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stared back at him worried about what he was thinking but she stood to follow him out of the cafe. "You have nothing to worry about, as I promised many times. As long as you haven't harmed us, we have no reason to harm you." She then walked with him in silence.* - Thu Nov 19 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) chuckled but she was laready getting quite cold from the air. "I personally do not seek money or power, only happiness. As for the other's, I cannot be certain... you will just have to have your meeting with my Sensei." She shuddered and held herself with arms wrapped around her upper body and couldn't feel her legs hardly in the breezy cool air. "I'm already in trouble I'm sure, I can practically feel it. Me staying a bit longer isn't going to harm it anymore than it already is. I'm hoping that me arranging the meeting with dampen my punishment."* - Thu Nov 19 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes shifted away from him as he looked her over, it was clear it made her uncomfortable for a moment at the thought. She looked at the scroll and then took it from him and unsealed it away from herself in case it just happened to be a trap. Never can be too careful.* - Thu Nov 19 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Once upon a time. - Thu Nov 19 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Shinobi used Ninjutsu to defend, not to kill. - Thu Nov 19 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't like how perceptive he was that she was valued in some way by her Sensei. She pulled the jacket on and wrapped it tightly about her body and sighed out in content. When he started to tell her a story she opened her eyes and looked over to him. She really was starting to enjoy this land, it was unfortunate they were all treated so poorly in the past... at least with Konoha, most of them deserved it.* - Thu Nov 19 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Which is why. - Thu Nov 19 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Our temple is being the first pl- - Thu Nov 19 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) simply stood there in silence.* - Thu Nov 19 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) simply watched him.* - Thu Nov 19 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Like I was saying. - Thu Nov 19 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Our Temple is going to be the first place that is built.- - Thu Nov 19 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I might move indoors in a bit. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Hm? - Thu Nov 19 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Would you... like me to come into the mansion? - Thu Nov 19 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It's up to you. - Thu Nov 19 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...no funny business right? - Thu Nov 19 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: .  . What do you mean? - Thu Nov 19 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....uh.. the 'or worse' thing. - Thu Nov 19 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) twitched her lips to the side and scratched the side of her head.* - Thu Nov 19 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Oh.. Well, I mean.. - Thu Nov 19 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Do I give off that sort of vibe? - Thu Nov 19 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: No funny business, I promise. - Thu Nov 19 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'm not like that. - Thu Nov 19 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: If you leave, men from Sunagakure will escort you away. - Thu Nov 19 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) twitched her lips, "will I be able to leave the mansion after those tags are activated?" She was curious about that since it could mean her being locked inside.* - Thu Nov 19 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I could release it at anytime - Thu Nov 19 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But. - Thu Nov 19 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: No. - Thu Nov 19 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Wait. - Thu Nov 19 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Once I drop it. - Thu Nov 19 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....so... - Thu Nov 19 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: ... - Thu Nov 19 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Nevermind. - Thu Nov 19 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yeah. - Thu Nov 19 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Nothing like that. - Thu Nov 19 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Do you want my company or not? - Thu Nov 19 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'm just going to head in my mansion- I do. - Thu Nov 19 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I dont want other people. - Thu Nov 19 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded and then followed him.* - Thu Nov 19 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn...what's your name? - Thu Nov 19 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Eiyu. - Thu Nov 19 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Eiyu.... - Thu Nov 19 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Of the Minatabi clan. - Thu Nov 19 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I must admit--- - Thu Nov 19 21:07:37 2015
