<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I don't think I should continue asking questions. - Thu Nov 19 21:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Your Sensei. Would you kill for him, die for him? Would you die for the Sake of Konohagakure, or kill for it? - Thu Nov 19 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I would do both for my Sensei without needing to think on it too deeply, I already have made the decision to act in that manner. As for Konoha, I have killed for it and as for dying for Konoha... not in it's current state. - Thu Nov 19 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: The settlement that I live at now... I find it to be home. - Thu Nov 19 21:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I see... That is very eye opening. - Thu Nov 19 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Does it make you think poorly of me that I wouldn't die for my native village? - Thu Nov 19 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But perhaps flawed. - Thu Nov 19 21:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: We stand. - Thu Nov 19 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I understand the fact that you would kill for your Sensei. - Thu Nov 19 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But would you kill an infant to save his life?  - Thu Nov 19 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Would you kill a child for your Sensei? - Thu Nov 19 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You see. - Thu Nov 19 21:28:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) did not hesitate.* - Thu Nov 19 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: If it meant to save his life, I would. - Thu Nov 19 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I don't understand.. . . - Thu Nov 19 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: That is utter loyalty. - Thu Nov 19 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: ...What you call loyalty, I call indoctrination. - Thu Nov 19 21:30:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You would defile it on a whim, it's not even selfish, it's just wrong. - Thu Nov 19 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: It's wrong to -you-. - Thu Nov 19 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Life is indeed sacred. - Thu Nov 19 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: But who is to say that the child's life is more valuable than my Sensei's? - Thu Nov 19 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Exactly, but by killing the child you prove that the childs life is more valuable than your Sensei's. - Thu Nov 19 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I do not believe in the child, the child has not accomplished anything that is worthy of saving their life over my Sensei's to me personally. For that matter the child could grow up to be a great enemy or an evil entity. - Thu Nov 19 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He could also shape the world into a better future.. You would never know, but I suppose I can knock you there. - Thu Nov 19 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: However. - Thu Nov 19 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: How do I make the child's life more valuable in that case? - Thu Nov 19 21:33:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: There is no right or wrong answer. - Thu Nov 19 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Would I kill someone to save my mothers life? No, would I kill the person who destroyed my village, no... It's just as extreme, isn't it? - Thu Nov 19 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I understand. - Thu Nov 19 21:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You and I hold very different philosophies. - Thu Nov 19 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Even if that means you're throwing away apart of yourself. - Thu Nov 19 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Which your Sensei, if he was your teacher would want to be the last thing on your mind. - Thu Nov 19 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes, we do. - Thu Nov 19 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Why would my Sensei want himself to be the last thing on my mind? - Thu Nov 19 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: We live in an era of generations, you are his student, someone who he wants to surpass him. - Thu Nov 19 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: So he teaches you. - Thu Nov 19 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He makes you stronger. - Thu Nov 19 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But. - Thu Nov 19 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It should be by improving yourself. By killing an infant, or child just to see him safe. - Thu Nov 19 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: If he's about peace. - Thu Nov 19 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Why would we want that? - Thu Nov 19 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....it's not that he would want that. - Thu Nov 19 21:36:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: So you would defy his wishes for your own purpose? - Thu Nov 19 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You see... at the settlement there is freedom within the settlement itself to believe your own philosophies and follow them. - Thu Nov 19 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Yes, and that is selfish. - Thu Nov 19 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: But it is who I am, selfish in the case of my Sensei's survival. - Thu Nov 19 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I am not necessarily selfish in other area's though. - Thu Nov 19 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You have strong feelings for your Sensei. I assume it's akin to a daughter loving her father. It's true, that prospect is -very- selfish. - Thu Nov 19 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But. - Thu Nov 19 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Love. - Thu Nov 19 21:39:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Even if that's not what they want. - Thu Nov 19 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Whereas having true love would be understanding the persons wishes, and accepting them no matter what. - Thu Nov 19 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I predict you will have to make a -very- tough choice. - Thu Nov 19 21:40:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was trying not to snoop but she could tell he was doing fuuinjutsu. "If you weren't the type of person you are then I would have behaved differently."* - Thu Nov 19 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thought about it and shrugged, "I would have thought of something."* - Thu Nov 19 21:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: And what you are saying is likely something my Sensei will say too. - Thu Nov 19 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: He might even just do it to teach me a lesson. - Thu Nov 19 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I just care about everyone, it's my weakness. Hm, I've taken a -large- portion of your d-. So your Sensei is like me? Er-..? O-. - Thu Nov 19 21:52:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded and followed after him with her head low and hands folded in front of her.* - Fri Nov 20 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) || As soon as she stepped in the door, Eri began to take off her clothing as was the rule he had decided. She took piece by piece off and folded them fairly neatly on the table by the door, until she was completely nude and standing there in the entry way.* - Fri Nov 20 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) walked over to the couch at a normal pace and stood beside it with her head still down. She was admittedly nervous as all get out since she figured this would be a -real- punishment this time since she had done something that could get her killed.* - Fri Nov 20 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) hadn't sat down, but neither had he so she remained standing. With her eyes focused on her toes she spoke up in a low but well heard voice, "one reason was to impress you, another was because I didn't think that Hatsu would be able to pull it off. And you know what? I'm right, Eiyu would not have liked Hatsu at all and I was the perfect person to convince him. If he knew you were Ortho as my Sensei before we arrived? He would not have come... He also wanted to send a clone instead but I told him that was too far of a distance for a clone to last. He wanted to wait a -week- but I knew that you would want to meet as soon as possible. A week also would have given him time to set up a possible trap if you -really were- trying to trap him in some way. I wanted things to go according to whatever plan you had even if you told me that you wanted an alliance." She paused in thought and then twitched her lips.

"It also was for very selfish reasons, I wanted to prove myself to you because you haven't sent me on any dangerous or out of settlement missions let alone by myself but you trust Hatsu or others with those missions and I feel like you should trust me the most but I don't have that level of trust with you as a shinobi of the settlement. I have your trust as your student, as your lover... but not as your shinobi." She then went quiet and a small tremble likely could be noticed, not only from her words getting her worked up, but also from the chill of the AC in the room since the weather was getting colder this time of year and the fact she was worried what he might say to her selfishness.* - Fri Nov 20 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) swallowed hard as he lifted her chin but she didn't want to look up at him. Her eyes remained down and as their lips came to press together she trembled heavier before relaxing some and easing into the passionate kiss. When the kiss broke and she was guided to the couch in the form of on her knee's on the cushions and hands on the back of the couch she closed her eyes for a moment suspecting what he was going to do. She didn't understand why he felt this was a punishment though. Twitching her lips again as she habitually did, Eri looked over her shoulder to him. "If...if you are going to do what I think you are... I have to admit to you, Sensei... that isn't a punishment."* - Fri Nov 20 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes at what he said, she looked up at him with eyes of curiousity but figured there was -no way- he could hold out. She could hold out easily, but him? It still was a considerable punishment though... She swallowed hard as he started to stroke roughly over her clit and massage her ass cheek in the way that was just the right amount of toughness. Her head lowered back down and rested her forehead on the back of the couch as she closed her eyes and told herself not to enjoy this too much or she -was- going to have trouble missing him when she wasn't allowed to touch him. "With rule number one still in play during my punishment?"* - Fri Nov 20 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was holding her own fairly well until his thumb started to sink into her pucker and part the tightened rim. She gasped out and arched her back as that clearly was effecting her the most out of all his touching. Back arched and she lifted her head with chin high in pleasure of the thumb forcing into her at the slow pace. When his words delivered his intentions she whined hopelessly knowing that was the worst type of this kind of punishment.. further because she knew that his pleasure would mean him touching her as he pleased without her release. "Y-you don't think this punishment is.... lacking... or... unfair to the situation, S-sir?" She held back a moan by biting down on her tongue and shuddering slow and hard.* - Fri Nov 20 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) moaned out as his fingers started to pull at her lips to make the chilly air brush over her wet flesh. How he had dug his fingers deep into her didn't really bother her all that much but the clit rubbing was certainly on point. It was the little teases that really got to her rather than the rough blunt 'attacks' to her cunt. When his thumb slid in smoother and deeper she felt her legs nearly buckle in pleasure as her hips lowered for a moment before she forced them to raise again for Ortho's satisfication. As he spoke though... she practically sounded like she was about to sob in reaction. Her words shakey as she spoke out in distress, "I deserve a punishment... so I will take one."* - Fri Nov 20 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) could hear the zipper like a death trap closing in and held perfectly still as her ass pulsated with sensation from his thumb entering further. There was something about a thumb that always gave a special feeling inside...it was rougher... curved... thicker...it was perfect... As he insisted on her trying to persuade him she didn't even know how to go about it...she had stopped begging for anything before she turned ten. "I... I do deserve the punishment, it's not giving up, it's acceptance... I... just... well...what do you want as payment for me to recieve no punishment? Whatever you want, Sensei." She thought that was a pretty good deal all things considered what Ortho might be able to think up.* - Fri Nov 20 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) screamed out in pain and pleasure of him entering her so quickly. The thumb that was pulling out and forcing back into her made her ache within her belly. She clenched down with her pussy and ass both for a moment before telling herself to relax and ease back into him. Her hips pushed back against him, another inch deeper if he hadn't stopped her actions. "Wh-what is the promise you want me to make?" by this time she was panting out a thin film of sweat had covered her body even in the chill of the living room. Her body trembled and rocked back and forth against him instinctively.* - Fri Nov 20 08:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was nearing a point she couldn't hold back her climax and when he pulled her back hard after her ass cheeks pressed tightly against his lower belly, Eri couldn't stand it. How he was filling her entirely and just -sitting- there, speared inside of her while finger fucking her ass with his thumb. Her tiny body spasmed and then began to gush creamy fluids about his cock that leaked out along her swollen pussy lips and dripped onto the couch. She shuddered and bit down onto the back of the couch as she screamed out in pleasure. It was obvious she was cumming extremely hard just by how much her body had seized up and couldn't stop vibrating while her cunt dripped more than it ever had. She heard his words but couldn't speak.* - Fri Nov 20 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's body was becoming very lax from the fact she had just orgasmed so heavily. Her hips lowered weakly and she trembled a small amount. She was nearing a second orgasm simply from his thumb and it was obvious she had become lost to her lust as he fingered her relaxed bottom that had become soaked in his saliva and her cum. A slow climb to another orgasm was evident by how her breathing slowed at first and then began to speed up as she shuddered and her body began to redden in splotches in some areas. A tiny moaning whine began low and built as she clenched around his cock again, it was clear she allowed herself to let go due to the fact this might be the last time she felt his cock inside of her for a long time....* - Fri Nov 20 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt heated and dizzy now from cumming so hard two times in a row. She could hardly stay up on her knee's and he likely was going to have to hold her up if she was to stay in the position.* - Fri Nov 20 09:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was extremely relaxed by this point... he would easily be able to slip in and the only thing resistant against him was her muscles own stretching point that needed to be exercised. She moaned gently as he began to slip his head inside of her, which almost happened 'too' easily, from how arroused she was and how he had been toying with her with his thumb. She pressed back against him in little pumps of pleasure but for the most part he was in control of her body entirely. Eri could only coo lightly in pleasure rather than speak, his words still on her mind about the promise but not being able to speak, at this point she didn't care what he did or didn't do to her.* - Fri Nov 20 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) grunted lightly as he shifted her on the couch and she was like a rag doll as another tiny orgasm wrecked through her inner wall and sent her into a moaning spasm. She was high as hell now, laying there with her lids half open and all his to play with, fully conscious and quivering as she was at his mercy, he could do anything he wanted to her right now and she wouldn't be able to stop him. She was fully at his mercy...* - Fri Nov 20 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wouldn't be able to stop him... if he did decide to base out. She probably just wouldn't be running or doing anything strenuous for a while afterwards if he decided to go all the way. Her pussy squirted lightly against his balls and dripped down onto the couch, they were probably going to need a new one...a leather one for their kind of activities when they were alone. Sighing out a shakey breath as he began the rythmic beat against her ass and enjoyed how tight she was, probably tighter than he ever assumed was even possible to endure for his engorged length... it was the perfect tightness to tug and squeeze at every ripple of his cock's skin and firmness.* - Fri Nov 20 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) couldn't think straight the deeper he went, she was into a daze as a few mor orgasms hit and she couldn't feel when they occured anymore since she was so tingly it was as if she was in a constant high. He could likely see this on her face, the utter contentment as if she was on escatsy.* - Fri Nov 20 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's ears burned from the sound of him moaning, it was beautiful... she wished to hear it more often. Grunting lightly as he stuffed deeper inside of her own ended with her pussy lips soaking again and a gushing sound of her juices being made from all the bubbles created from the friction. She was already realizing what he was going to do... but wasn't about to object, not that she could even speak. She wanted to moan louder and call out his name.. call him sensei, but her lips only parted and closed again as no voice sounded.* - Fri Nov 20 10:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was extremely light weight for Ortho to move as she always was, but there was something about a girl being lax and unresistant that made her much easier to move around. With her legs spread wide and him now resting them on their sides with her breast grasped and nipple hardened as sharp as it could manage.... the sex aroma filled the room. 

As the clapping sound started her thighs continued to drench in her juices and he was all too easily able to fuck her now that he had stretched her out inside. Of course, it did hurt a small amount but the stimulation of pleasure was too strong right now for her to register the pain, that would come later... For now she only continued to orgasm after orgasm, a count couldn't be kept as she moaned softly and coo'd nearly till she felt like she might have accidently drooled from how much pleasure he was giving. If she hadn't been so dazed perhaps she would be embarrassed but nothing could be felt right now than this being the most 'right' a person can feel like...ever.* - Fri Nov 20 10:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) couldn't tell he was nearing orgasm in the least, she was pretty gone. He was getting everything he wanted in that moment and she was all his. That much was obvious by the expression on her face, utter content and lust while being severely out of the zone and control over her body. She could think but everything was smeared and twisted, all she could understand was pleasure and her body felt like it was on fire from how hot she had become, not to mention her cheeks were bright red and her neck and chest were flushed from how many orgasms she had. * - Fri Nov 20 11:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: it's also -fucking amazing- feeling - Fri Nov 20 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gasped gently as he started to spray inside of her backside, the sensation was something she had never felt before and it made her more aware for a moment as he slowed his pace and filled her enough that she felt like her stomach was going to explode from how filled she was with his cock and the cum inside of her. "Nngngn..." groaned out as she pressed her back against him in a twitch but she didn't move anymore or say anything. Her body only occasionally twitched or a gentle moan and sigh emitted. Just as he was panting, so was she... trying to cool off from the escapade and how hot she had become... It was going to take her a long time.* - Fri Nov 20 11:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) groaned as he pulled out of her and she tried to tense her backside to stop from releasing the cum out over the both of them but she didn't have enough control over her muscles to do so. The cum started to leak out in a steady run down her ass cheek and between them before forming a soaking pool on the couch. She trembled in embarrassment now and closed her eyes as she tried to hide her shame.* - Fri Nov 20 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) eventually slowed her breathing and was slowly coming out of her high. Even as amazing she felt, the pain started to come to her and the embarrassment grew the more she felt the cum seeping out of her weakened bottom. Biting down hard on her lip she remained quiet still trying to clench tighter to stop it from painting her body further.* - Fri Nov 20 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) grumbled weakly at his words, whispering back. "I... just... this is something I've never done... it feels... embarrassing... and.. I feel dirty all over... my whole body is covered in... sex." She flushed a deeper red and bit down on her lip.* - Fri Nov 20 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I don't think I can walk. - Fri Nov 20 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Or stand... - Fri Nov 20 11:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: On the bright side, you managed to get out of your punishment. - Fri Nov 20 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) snickered and groaned in pain as her legs tried to curl up against her.* - Fri Nov 20 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I'm not so sure. - Fri Nov 20 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Hmm? Why's that? - Fri Nov 20 11:58:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: B-but... I still don't think I should go without punishment..... - Fri Nov 20 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I can't deny that you did a good job, Eri. Sometimes to do the 'right thing' you have to break the rules. - Fri Nov 20 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: A necessary evil. - Fri Nov 20 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: By tomorrow I'll forget about it. - Fri Nov 20 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sighed out gently and pressed her head back against his shoulder and neck.* - Fri Nov 20 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Are you sure you don't want to punish me? - Fri Nov 20 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I tried not to smile when you sent your letter back to me. - Fri Nov 20 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I didn't do a very good job. - Fri Nov 20 12:03:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Eri. - Fri Nov 20 12:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I don't have to say this, but I want you to be completely honest with me about something.. - Fri Nov 20 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) opened her eyes to peer up at him from the side.* - Fri Nov 20 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..We've been expressing ourselves to each other for a while.. Be it sexually, visually and other ways.. - Fri Nov 20 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You do know.. that at any point.. you can call a quits.. right? Like.. I know I have your loyalty and honest.. I really appreciate that.. But I want you to always remember you have free will/. - Fri Nov 20 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Fri Nov 20 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Why are you saying this? - Fri Nov 20 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked at him with frustration in her gaze.* - Fri Nov 20 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Because my love for you wants you to be in complete control of you.. - Fri Nov 20 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: And I once told you, I am always free. - Fri Nov 20 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: But to further sate your curiousity... I don't need to remind you of all the things we have promised each other... I need only tell you one thing. - Fri Nov 20 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: And all I want to know is that -you- know.. it'll always be like that. - Fri Nov 20 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I wasn't planning on telling you this... - Fri Nov 20 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: When I was in Kumogakure... the Raikage was asking me questions and one of his questions led to me admitting that I would kill an innocent child if it meant saving your life, even if I knew you would not want me to kill that child. - Fri Nov 20 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) graoned deeply in pain and then curled in against him as she felt the full force of her inner abdomen aching as if she had just got done working out for hours on end on her abdomen alone.* - Fri Nov 20 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: groaned* - Fri Nov 20 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) finished her pained sounds and looked up to him after her name had been said. When she saw him opening his eyes her own went wide and she stared in disbelief. "O-ortho, you did it," whispered out in wonder as she stared at his eyes and couldn't believe what she said had given him such an enlightenment. Course.... what she had said basically meant she loved him, she should have expected as much.* - Fri Nov 20 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) leaned in and pressed her lips against his own gently, she didn't give a passionate kiss, simply a romantic gesture. Her lips pressing and shifting against his own before breaking away and breathing across the corner of his lips. "I can't believe I told you that..."* - Fri Nov 20 12:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled gently, "I suppose me going soft was enough for you to mature your sharingan further, then it was certainly worth it." She didn't say anything else, those weren't the words she had wanted to say... She had wanted to say she loved him but had held back.* - Fri Nov 20 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Perhaps what I said was enough for him to know... - Fri Nov 20 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wondered why he was glaring at her and pushed her nose against his own, "What is it?" whispered out.* - Fri Nov 20 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose her brow in wonder and could feel her heart beat rushing as he said such a thing. It -felt- like he was pushing her to say those three big words. Her voice was shakey and her lower lip quivered as she struggled internally.* - Fri Nov 20 13:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her lip and sighed out in relief, "oh you meant... -you- saying something."* - Fri Nov 20 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) pursed her lips, "Oh nothing!" Her voice squeaking and then she spoke quickly, "we should really get into the bath, yeah?"* - Fri Nov 20 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was turning quite red and she was sure he understood what just happened. "Y-yeah, I really... want to clean up... I think we ruined your couch."* - Fri Nov 20 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stopped him with a hand on his shoulder, she leaned in to kiss him gently again for a bit longer this time. Whispering afterwards, "I will say it soon enough..."* - Fri Nov 20 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Then why did you just grumble like a bear?~ - Fri Nov 20 13:57:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Nah nahhhhhhhhhh.~ - Fri Nov 20 13:58:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Shit shit shit.. - Fri Nov 20 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Why not?~ - Fri Nov 20 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Oh.. because umm. - Fri Nov 20 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Listen let's just take the shower and go from there. - Fri Nov 20 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Bath, mister, bath. - Fri Nov 20 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) reached down and took hold of his flaccid cock tightly.* - Fri Nov 20 14:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ---- - Fri Nov 20 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Okay, okay! - Fri Nov 20 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Wait wait wait. - Fri Nov 20 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Lets think about this.. - Fri Nov 20 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stroked long and tight, extremely slow.* - Fri Nov 20 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ...... - Fri Nov 20 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Maybe I'll make -you- sore this time. - Fri Nov 20 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ...... - Fri Nov 20 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Give it your best.. lick. - Fri Nov 20 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) pursed her lips like 'yeah right'. Her hand that was stroking his cock continued to stroke very slow and hard while her other hand reached back and began to run over his ass cheek towards the divide between the two.* - Fri Nov 20 14:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: How do I get myself into these situations..? - Fri Nov 20 14:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Who said this would be like last time? I'll be gentle.~ - Fri Nov 20 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) had spoken her words seductively as she continued to move her fingers closer and closer and knew he wouldn't allow it... he would stop her as soon as he hit a breaking point, it was obvious he didn't like such a thing.* - Fri Nov 20 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I can't even threaten to do the same to her.. she already took my all in her.. - Fri Nov 20 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Hoooow doooo I geeet myyy seelf inttooo theeeseee sittuaatiioonns. - Fri Nov 20 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) inhaled sharply and widened her eyes staring up at him in fear of the sensation she was about to feel. When he stopped she diverted her eyes and pulled her hands away from him. "Why did you stop?"* - Fri Nov 20 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Hmph... - Fri Nov 20 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I suppose we can get into the bath now. - Fri Nov 20 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) inhaled deeply with lust evident.* - Fri Nov 20 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) groaned in pain and pleasure.* - Fri Nov 20 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: No... no... I want it again. - Fri Nov 20 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I don't think I can take anymore that rough... - Fri Nov 20 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Perhaps.... something...  - Fri Nov 20 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smirked lightly as she whispered, "soft? In the bath?"* - Fri Nov 20 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I am after all...going to need help.... - Fri Nov 20 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Perhaps perhaps... I mean... you are going to help me wash myself right? And of course... I'm going to help you.~ - Fri Nov 20 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) tensed as he picked her up and carried her, Eri's body ached but she tried to keep it to herself for now about how bad it really was. As he sat her on his lap she could feel cum still leaking out of her every so often when she was shifted from both holes. "Mn, bubbles.~ And uh... can you make it...extra hot? Unless you won't enjoy it, I feel like...the hotter the better right now." She shifted a bit on his lap and cringed again. Yeah, extra hot was needed.* - Fri Nov 20 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked up to him, "why did you stop yourself?" * - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: What were you going to call me? - Fri Nov 20 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ,,Babe.. - Fri Nov 20 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) laid back against his chest with her back since straddling would hurt too much. She stretched out with him in the basin of the tub with the hot water burning her sex and bottom but it felt good while hurting at the same time. Shifting a bit she groaned lightly and then whispered to him with her lips just above the bubbles. "You can call me whatever you'd like, student, babe, baby, Eri... in private of course, Ri.... babecakes, bae." She went on to stating several other pet names until he would stop her.* - Fri Nov 20 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was already sitting in the tea shop drinking out of a medium sized tea cup with heat slowly wafting off the surface of the dark drink. She had her NinjaTunes buds in her ears and was listening to some classic rock music that could be heard barely coming out of the earbuds close to her position. She wasn't wearing the hoodie like last time he saw her, or the stockings... but everything else was pretty much the same.* - Fri Nov 20 17:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) luckily, she didn't hear him because of her music or she would be embarrassing him further. She bobbed her head lightly to the beat and sipped her tea, he wasn't noticed since there were several people walking in and out of the tea shop for tea and then either sitting at other tables or walking out.* - Fri Nov 20 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes eventually had come up from her tea and lowered lids listening to the music as the song shifted to a new beat. She was startled suddenly by him sitting in front of her and inhaled sharply as her hand had got to her side but she eased off after seeing who it was. Reaching up she pulled at the cord to her ear buds and let them fall into her lap before pressing the pause button on her NinjaTunes and tucking it away into her pocket. "What are you doing here?"* - Fri Nov 20 17:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I will not be tricked by backwater politics anymore. - Fri Nov 20 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes slightly, "seems like you have been busy... I didn't know you would research so far into this. I'm glad to hear you are willing to be on our side on this matter."* - Fri Nov 20 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: What do you think? - Fri Nov 20 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) smiled a sly grin towards him and sipped her tea. "We never said we lived here, Eiyu-kun." Her voice hinted towards teasing as she spoke, when he mentioned asking Sunagakure's forces to leave though she pursed her lips. "Speak to Ortho about that before you try... the Kazekage will not take kindly to being kicked out of the land he 'owns'."* - Fri Nov 20 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head, "I understand it angers you to hear me say that he owns the village you run... but he -does- claim to own it." She then rose a brow at the mention of a summit and sat her cup down. "They called a summit? With you included? Who? Hassan, the Mizukage, and you?"* - Fri Nov 20 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) lowered her gaze and sipped from the cup, "I honestly don't know very much about Edge."* - Fri Nov 20 17:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I know that he killed off a large portion of Kumogakure. - Fri Nov 20 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I know that Sunagakure -jumped- at the chance. - Fri Nov 20 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: To 'help'. - Fri Nov 20 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But to think. - Fri Nov 20 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: They wish to turn us into them. - Fri Nov 20 17:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Wrong. - Fri Nov 20 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I can't say I have been to Sunagakure recently. - Fri Nov 20 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: That is one place I have no interest to go. - Fri Nov 20 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But alas I can't do a thing because of my limited resources, and people take good natured people for granted... - Yeah, don't go there... They'll deny you entry there anyway. - Fri Nov 20 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I hear people from Konoha get in rather easily. - Fri Nov 20 17:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Most of them never leave again though with their Konoha pride. - Fri Nov 20 17:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: They migrate wherever the pickings are the best. - Fri Nov 20 17:41:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: This topic is depressing.. I wish I hadn't told me what Hassan had said. - Fri Nov 20 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....I mean, the entire world pretty much knows he claims it. - Fri Nov 20 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Sorry though? - Fri Nov 20 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) gave him a dead pan look, "He said that? You shouldn't try to turn him away for now.. wait till you are stronger, keep the suna guards to gate and wall duty."* - Fri Nov 20 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It almost seems like. - Fri Nov 20 17:53:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I kind of wish you would stop saying that about my Sensei. - Fri Nov 20 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Wishful thinking, and me giving you false hope of this situation becoming better. - Fri Nov 20 17:59:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You can't hide from the truth. - Fri Nov 20 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I know it to be true, it doesn't mean I want to hear it three to five times in every conversation. - Fri Nov 20 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: And why do you trust me? - Fri Nov 20 18:01:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I trust you and Ortho... Mainly because. - Fri Nov 20 18:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: We're in a similar situation. - Fri Nov 20 18:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I suppose. - Fri Nov 20 18:03:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't trust anyone but my Sensei... but I would like to eventually trust you. - Fri Nov 20 18:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: It's a shinobi's world after all... trust is difficult. - Fri Nov 20 18:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: So you think I would betray you? That is reason enough for you to betray me in the future.... Perhaps my senses aren't as refined as Id like to believe..... - Fri Nov 20 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...I never said that. - Fri Nov 20 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Lacking trust fully and thinking you would betray me are very different things. - Fri Nov 20 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: . .  .I just don't understanda. - Fri Nov 20 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But I guess it makes sense. - Fri Nov 20 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: We can go over that topic. I don't expect for anyone to trust me, especially when my own shinobi don't. - Fri Nov 20 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: How is Konohagakure now? - Fri Nov 20 18:08:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps he was just making a point, and I misunderstood. - Fri Nov 20 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: No... forreal.. please explain. - Fri Nov 20 18:35:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: That is a miracle! - Fri Nov 20 18:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: No doubt she is going to lie as a means to protect her baby, which I can understand. Ironically, I honestly am happy for them, provided I didnt misunderstand Ortho's message. - Fri Nov 20 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Why would he tell you such lies about us laying together. - Fri Nov 20 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Likely his foolish wish to lay with his student. - Fri Nov 20 18:42:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Because...obviously he has been telling lies. - Fri Nov 20 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I doubt your Sensei is that kind of man. - Fri Nov 20 18:45:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Especially given the topic of our conversation. I won't tell a soul, I promise. - Fri Nov 20 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Because. - Fri Nov 20 18:46:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He made me promise. - Fri Nov 20 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Should anything happen to him. - Fri Nov 20 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: To let his family into Kumogakure, and I intend to keep that promise. - Fri Nov 20 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) frowned more and looked up to him, "That Sensei... always trying to send up away to be safe."* - Fri Nov 20 18:47:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes, "He showed you?" She didn't stop him from burning his hand, he was his own man and she didn't have a reason to stop him. When he mentioned 'mother, father' she diverted her gaze and lost focus. When he called them friends she sighed out gently and could feel her heart pounding. For a long moment the girl was unsure of what to say but then decided to speak up. "The fact he told you I am holding his legacy was hopeful... it shows he wishes for me to be pregnant, but.... I am not certain if I am or not."* - Fri Nov 20 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: We're even. - Fri Nov 20 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Never tell anyone. - Fri Nov 20 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her lip hard as it quivered and she struggled not to cry. She closed her eyes and sighed heavily from his story. "I'm glad you told me... it shows me he is hopeful for a child... and it also shows me he doesn't want to keep this entirely private... we had agreed on private, and this doesn't really make us even. You told me a story but your lover is gone... your child gone... this is here and now and now that he told someone that we are involved it makes me a target. I thought he didn't want me to be such a target... please do not ever speak of this to anyone...."* - Fri Nov 20 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) bit down on her lip, "I'm surprised he trusted you so quickly."* - Fri Nov 20 19:17:07 2015
