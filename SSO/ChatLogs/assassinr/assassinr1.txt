<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sat on her jacket that was spread out over the grass so she wouldn't get her rump dirty. Around her wrist was the Konoha headband as a wrist guard and she had on what would likely be considered punk runge style clothing.

Fingernails were painted a dark rusty gold hue and she was playing with the ruffles on her skirt while lightly bobbing her head every so often.* - Thu Nov 12 03:15:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't here the 'psst' from Ortho because of her music. Looking through the flyer she felt Jehan's shadow hovering over her. Peering up to him but not taking her earbuds out she waited for him to make some sign of what he wanted. Her eyes were wide and curious as she looked at him with the dark iris but she didn't at all put in effort to look 'too friendly' with a smile, no her lips remained relaxed. * - Thu Nov 12 03:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) exhaled out and set the flyer down on the grass and reached up to pull her left earbud out as some slow classic rock played, like the shit you expect Dean from Supernatural to be listening to. When she heard what he said after the word 'jams' all she could think was <who says the word jams these days?> Her lips parted and she said a firm, "no." Then in the earbud went back into her ear.* - Thu Nov 12 04:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..How can I know what you're capable of without you sparring someone? - Thu Nov 12 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I was poisoned a few hours ago. - Thu Nov 12 04:19:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't seem phased by anything going on around her as she went back to head bobbing while listening to the  music. Even surfing through the options to put on a more upbeat song.* - Thu Nov 12 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Seems like people are more interested in woman than anything else here. - Thu Nov 12 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) didn't stop Ortho from doing what he did. She simply listened on as the flyer was forgotten, she didn't know he ran the settlement, nor would she have cared. Instead she simply listened to the music with him beside her since he wasn't disturbing her. After a while she even went as far as to turn the music up so he could hear earlier. Only from the pure reason he enjoyed the music the same as she did.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) let him move in closer to hear better and to look at the digital device she had, it was old and worn so probably a hand-me-down and not the latest edition from Konoha. When he reached out for her skirt and just as his finger barely touched the ruffle her free hand flashed forward to grip his wrist, "no."* - Thu Nov 12 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) saw the nod out of the corner of her eyes and then released his hand gently and laid her hand back in her lap. She exhaled out a sigh as if that had caused some tension in her for him to reach towards her skirt like that and her heart was rushing for a few moments but it was calming again.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was chilling, calming down after Ortho had backed off and then all she could hear was something that was a shout. She didn't know what was said but when it was she jumped up quickly and her hands snapped together in preparation of making a handseal. Obviously because of this her device fell onto her jacket on the ground and her earbuds were ripped out as the song played out into the area slightly louder due to them not being in her ears.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was scanning the area, she didn't care about the device being held up to her even if it was expensive in worth to her. When she spotted Akira she started to go towards him, "something's wrong." Her voice was cool (as in temperature cool, not im wearing shades cool) and to the point. She crouched down beside him with her legs together as to not flash him from below her skirt and tried to feel his forehead with her inner wrist to see if he had a fever.* - Thu Nov 12 05:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt her hand knocked away and she restood while backing up as she saw that Naoya was the threat to Akira. Her knee's were slightly bent in preparation if she needed to act as she watched him carefully. * - Thu Nov 12 05:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was not amazed, she simply walked over and picked up her NinjaTunes device and tucked it away into her skirt's pocket and then picked up her jacket and brushed it off before pulling it back on and straightening the material out. She left the flyer for the settlement on the ground.* - Thu Nov 12 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked back over towards Akira and then walked over to him and stood there for half a moment before speaking, "yes?"* - Thu Nov 12 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked his face over and then to his hands and back up, "I was checking if you had a fever. You looked ill."* - Thu Nov 12 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head to him as she looked him over, "no, I'm not... but you looked like you were going to pass out. At least I kept you from passing out until the guy who did this got here." She had scanned him pretty thoroughly with her gaze before looking at his shoulder, "is that old? Or did you get hurt?"* - Thu Nov 12 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stood by waiting for him to get the jacket off, she didn't try to take it from him and when she saw the wound her nose wrinkled up around her tiny nose piercing. "You are going to need a doctor I think, I -could- clean it but I don't know how to stitch and that's an open wound, pretty sure you need someone that knows what they are doing to mess with it." She glanced around to see if there was anyone who looked even concerned about Akira to hint they might be a doctor, a nurse, or a medical shinobi. She didn't know where the hospital was in this place or if they even had one.* - Thu Nov 12 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) watched Ortho walk up like it was nothing and start to heal the boy, she stood by as his wound disappeared and then she spoke up again. "Right, well you looked like you might be important in the future to the settlement so I thought I should do something." She saw he didn't want to talk and she had been right about to ask him who he was but his mind was off somewhere else up in the tree's. Dark eyes flicked over his visage seeing the peace come over him so she twitched her nose in a wiggle of thought before nodding and turning to walk away. She strolled around for a bit looking up at the buildings and trying to spot signs to tell her the surroundings.* - Thu Nov 12 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was staring up at a local bar and noting it down in a notepad with a little map she had drawn for herself. Turning around to face Akira as she tucked away the book the girl approached him once more. When he wasn't leaning against the tree he was much taller than her, the girl wasn't paying attention to whatever those two over to the South were talking about since it was rather uninteresting to Eri. "Oh uh, yeah no harm. Call me Supaiku," she gave her formal surname for now since she didn't know Akira in a personal way such as friends or family. "Who'r you?"* - Thu Nov 12 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shrugged a bit, "you have that look like you've been through somethin' in life. So that means you are potentially useful to the settlement, I could be wrong but then again maybe me saying that will encourage you to actually try to be useful to the settlement." She sniffed lightly and nodded, "No family name?" She was curious why he hadn't introducted himself in the same formality she had done to him.* - Thu Nov 12 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked down at her hand holding the now closed notepad. Everything he had said before this point was heart but wasn't all that important to Eri, she had a strange sense of importance as well as patience. "I was drawing out a map of the settlement so I don't get lost, it was strange the flyer didn't have a map."* - Thu Nov 12 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shot a glance to the flyer on the ground she had left there as trash. "Yeah uh, I mean I didn't need it anymore I kind of forgot it I'm guessin'." She nodded her head over to the flyer by the flower bush. "You could check it out, just tells you about some of the stuff here, and like a menu for the ramen shop. Stuff like that." She then looked South towards Paine and Ortho. "Is that medic really the one running this place?"* - Thu Nov 12 07:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) watched Ortho and Paine as Akira responded before looking back. "I don't know he just doesn't seem like a doctor." She didn't see a doctor in his eyes or in his way of going about talking or acting, she just didn't see it.* - Thu Nov 12 07:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Thu Nov 12 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stuck her notepad into her bag and then shoved her hands into her jacket pockets while he was looking around. "I haven't been here long either, that's why I'm drawin' a map, yeah?" She had thought it was a rather stupid request from him but after a moment looking him over and seeing as he had been through a lot she sighed out and closed her eyes for a moment to roll them behind the closed lids. Reopening her eyes she nodded, "Sure yeah... I'll show you around."* - Thu Nov 12 07:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) pursed her lips in a thin line and then nodded. She glanced over towards Ortho again as another thought went through her mind about him and then she pushed it away as it wasn't important at the moment. Pulling her map back out she began to lead the boy over to the local shops, of course all small as this settlement was still growing. "Looks like this is the hub of the place, what did they call it again? Shinogakure?"* - Thu Nov 12 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded to the pint sized remark. "Hm... Shinkogakure...what's that mean I wonder..." she was speaking to herself more than asking the question but perhaps he knew. Walking along the little path's she led Akira over to the local barber shop and pharmacy. They were even smaller than the hub market place full of shops. "Mn... nothing like Konoha, then again Konoha hasn't been the same for a while," she assumed Akira was from Konoha as well since this place was made for Konoha shinobi, at least that is what Eri thought it was for. Some sort of home away from home refuge that looked semi-permanent for some and permanent for others. "You got family back in Konoha?"* - Thu Nov 12 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head, "died in the upgrising a few years back." Something about how she had said that sounded like it might have been a lie to anyone who was -extremely- perceptive. Eri was a good liar so it came off very casual. "I probably will stay here permanently if I enjoy it."* - Thu Nov 12 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stopped in front of the ramen and steak shop and looked it over. She really wasn't hungry, plus she liked to eat in her own home. Didn't really have a home at the moment since the settlement was still getting assignments in place so she was waiting for a call back. "Nah, go ahead, you get some some food I got something I want to do before it get's dark." She waved to him and tucked her map back into her bag. "Nice to meet you Akira, try not to eat anything spicy with that poison in your system, can't imagine that turning out okay." She then turned and started to head South towards the entrance of the settlement.* - Thu Nov 12 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nodded one last time and then headed the rest of the way out of the main gate past all the guards and didn't even give them the time of day. Some of the younger ones near her age stared with their heads unmoving but their eyes following but none of the older ones seemed all that interested.* - Thu Nov 12 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was not aware of being followed so she continued on!* - Thu Nov 12 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stopped soon after exiting the village since it was quieter out here she could hear Ortho approaching unless he was trying to be a sneak. Turning about to look at him she simply stared wondering why he was following her.* - Thu Nov 12 08:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hey.. - Thu Nov 12 08:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked him over as she saw the bottle of sake and didn't like this look but he sounded sober enough. "No."* - Thu Nov 12 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: No..? - Thu Nov 12 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh, okay then.. - Thu Nov 12 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Name's Ortho. - Thu Nov 12 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) pursed her lips again and then stepped forward so she was in range of not having to speak her name louder than the average volume. "Name's Supaiku."* - Thu Nov 12 08:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) twitched her nose some and thought about what he was saying but it sounded like bullshit. "You saying that shows how little time this settlement has existed."* - Thu Nov 12 08:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn...  - Thu Nov 12 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) turned and started walking away, such an interesting conversation they were having.* - Thu Nov 12 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stopped and turned around, "Are you going to say your sister?"* - Thu Nov 12 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hell no. - Thu Nov 12 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Fuck that. - Thu Nov 12 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I said mellow, not crazy. - Thu Nov 12 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn... a past lover then. - Thu Nov 12 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..N-No.. - Thu Nov 12 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A close friend that passed on too soon. - Thu Nov 12 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) pursed her lips again and turned around to walk away, calling out. "Liar."* - Thu Nov 12 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Liar? Haha, I'm being honest. - Thu Nov 12 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A past lover.. is not it.. - Thu Nov 12 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I still request your audience. I do seek to get to know you just a bit.. - Thu Nov 12 09:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stopped again for only a moment, "then follow some more, creeper man." She kept on walking.* - Thu Nov 12 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ....... - Thu Nov 12 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Cute.. - Thu Nov 12 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) approached a tree in the woods that looked rather old and after picking up a leaf off the ground and examining it she walked over to the trunk and pulled out a kunai and began to stab it into the tree followed by twisting to dig a hole. * - Thu Nov 12 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) tugged the blade out and dropped it to the grass wthere there would wood chips from her digging into the tree. She reached into her bag and pulled out a glass bottle that looked like it was made for holding oils and such and then a little weird tube with a plunge. She shoved the tube into the hole of the tree and held the glass bottle under the end of the tube that had a spiquet to pour something. After a good twenty seconds the tree began to empty sap into the bottle. "Maple tree sap," she spoke out and continued to hold the bottle. This was going to take a while since it was such a small hole and tool to retrieve the sap. 

When he spoke of free training she realized he meant to the settlement. "No, I was tired of Konoha. Knew I didn't belong but I love Fire Country, when the idea of another shinobi settlement popped up on my radar with your message I headed over here."* - Thu Nov 12 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) remained silent as the sap slowly poored out and after his question she finally spoke up. "I will not be going back to Konoha and if this is the only shinobi settlement or village in Fire Country then I will be staying here." It wasn't confirming she would stay here but she truly already knew she wasn't leaving.* - Thu Nov 12 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) continued to hold the bottle under the tap, "I wouldn't be a shinobi if I didn't want to travel. Any shinobi who says they don't want to travel or don't enjoy it is a liar."* - Thu Nov 12 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you drink..? - Thu Nov 12 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Smoke.. - Thu Nov 12 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ? - Thu Nov 12 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Those sound rather personal. - Thu Nov 12 09:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Oh right, you are a doctor. - Thu Nov 12 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rolled her eyes and nodded, "Yeah, I do both."* - Thu Nov 12 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked back towards him and thought it over, "yeah, Konoha has shit pot ever since the attacks have been going on. Importers won't step through the gate, hell not even ten miles. Who is going to walk ten miles to get the good stuff?" She shook her head, "I gotta hold this bottle though, you gotta come over here."* - Thu Nov 12 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wasn't startled by him shunshin'ing at all. When he had the clone offer to do the work she squinted a bit. "Mn... I don't like others to do my work, it creates lack of disapline." She looked at the clone for a moment but then decided to let it go this once. Waiting for the clone to switch positions with her and take hold of the bottle she went to pull her jacket off and lay it on the grass before sitting upon it and glancingover at Ortho waiting for the blunt to be lit.* - Thu Nov 12 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) took the blunt with her index and thumb, she smoked how someone who smoked blunts often did, rather than holding it like a cigarette holder. She inhaled two tokes lightly on the first and then deep on the second before handing the blunt to him to take. She glanced down on the bottle while still holding in the smoke and then tilted her head up to blow it out overhead a light white tinted gas. "That's depressing," she reached out for the bottle and took a sip of the sake but not much. She could handle weed but drinking to much could make you unpredictable and she couldn't do that around someone she didn't trust.* - Thu Nov 12 09:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) glanced over at him as he toked and then summoned the sake. She pursed her lips again feeling like he might be trying to get in her pants or he was just a depressed older guy. "Seems like you got some things weighing on you if you just carry around that much sake to drink alone." She took the blunt and did her habitual two tokes at one time inhale and held it resting so that he could take it if he wanted to or let her hold onto it while he drank. Every so often she was glancing back to see where the bottle was at on being full. She did not plan to be here for very long.* - Thu Nov 12 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) kept the blunt and took another two hits. She watched him shove the sake in front of him and she rolled her eyes before picking up her own bottle and taking another drink after blowing out the smoke in an exhale through her nostrils. "Parents, started young," she paused, "I say that but I'm already pretty young, I started when I was twelve."* - Thu Nov 12 10:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow at him calling her a good girl, she was certainly not a good girl but wouldn't hinder his belief for now. She took another toke and held onto the rim of the bottle of sake. "That's pretty early to start, surprised you are able to even walk through the door of the settlement let alone create one."* - Thu Nov 12 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) glanced at him and then went, "Pfft, you call three years a learner? No." She shook her head and stared up at the clouds.* - Thu Nov 12 10:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Thu Nov 12 10:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) squinted some and then took a drink of sake, "You are immature." She was very perceptive and not an idiot.* - Thu Nov 12 10:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) took another inhale of the blunt, "Your attempt to get me worked up to get me to open up to you on accident."* - Thu Nov 12 10:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Either that or to get me to smoke and drink more out of irritation. - Thu Nov 12 10:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shrugged and toked again as she had smoked down a good quarter of the blunt. Clearly she was able to hold her own if she was still looking in her right mind after smoking that much alone. "I suppose not."* - Thu Nov 12 10:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: So this is business then. - Thu Nov 12 10:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't know you, why would I lighten up? I don't even know if you are a Konoha shinobi. - Thu Nov 12 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Born there, raised there. - Thu Nov 12 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: As for you lightening up, if I wanted to harm you.. I wouldn't be sharing my drink and blunt. - Thu Nov 12 10:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'd just be making my snakes consume you whole. - Thu Nov 12 10:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's just me being honest with you.~ - Thu Nov 12 10:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) watched him pull the bandages down and then shook her head after he finished his talk. "You aren't a Konoha shinobi, Konoha shinobi aren't ashamed of their heritage. Perhaps you were one once, but you aren't one anymore. Hiding it is shameful."* - Thu Nov 12 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked the scars over and nodded. "That is indeed a weakness." She then looked back up to the sky and took another inhale of the blunt. "Get to it then, cover whatever it is that's so important we are having a relaxing business meeting." She looked back at the clone to see the bottle was half full.* - Thu Nov 12 10:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Takes so fucking long. - Thu Nov 12 10:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) glanced back down and smiled faintly, "Better."* - Thu Nov 12 10:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: My turn? - Thu Nov 12 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Thu Nov 12 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....for? - Thu Nov 12 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're the first to see my arm up close.. other than the person that placed the scars there. - Thu Nov 12 10:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Consider it my attempt to gain your trust. - Thu Nov 12 10:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Now.. it's your turn. - Thu Nov 12 10:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked at him like he was crazy, "That's a bloody waste of something special."* - Thu Nov 12 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm.. - Thu Nov 12 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, fine. - Thu Nov 12 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Tell you what.. - Thu Nov 12 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Why would you show me something so special? - Thu Nov 12 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll show you one more thing.. if it spikes your interest, it's your turn- - Thu Nov 12 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Not even your sister or lovers have seen such a thing, that's just... - Thu Nov 12 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) frowned and took a deep inhalation of the blunt trying to clear her mind of the bad thoughts.* - Thu Nov 12 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Honestly..? I got it from protecting them.. well, most.. of them. - Thu Nov 12 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Why show them the end result that may make them feel like a burden? - Thu Nov 12 10:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: But why show -me-, you said why but it's just not a good enough reason. - Thu Nov 12 10:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Is it not good enough cause it's truly.. not good enough, or can you not just accept my reasoning? - Thu Nov 12 10:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's honestly my attempt to gain your trust. - Thu Nov 12 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's nostril flared some. "Fine, but what are you asking for in return. You say my turn like I have something to show."* - Thu Nov 12 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because.. it's only fair.~ - Thu Nov 12 11:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) tried to think but she didn't have any battle scars to show, nothing special on her body to show, she was an average joe for her village who had yet to do anything truly dangerous. "Telling you something a good replacement? I have nothing to show."* - Thu Nov 12 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked over at him, "I always have free will."* - Thu Nov 12 11:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Atta girl.~ - Thu Nov 12 11:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) pursed her lips again and then leaned her head back forward to take a very deep inhale of the blunt that was quickly turning into a roach, now that her mind was on something this important the bottle for the sap was forgotten. She exhaled out the smoke with eyes shutting calmly. Her voice lowered down as she told her secret, there was no shame in her voice, no pride either, just a simple fact being stated it seemed. "I killed my parents, and I used the uprising two years ago to cover it up."* - Thu Nov 12 11:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 12 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you regret it..? - Thu Nov 12 11:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: No. - Thu Nov 12 11:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Not in the least. - Thu Nov 12 11:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I see, I see.. - Thu Nov 12 11:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright.. - Thu Nov 12 11:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You've done it.. - Thu Nov 12 11:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) opened her eyes and looked over at him, "Done what?"* - Thu Nov 12 11:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Gained my trust. - Thu Nov 12 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I still want to show you something.. - Thu Nov 12 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You know that sounds insane. - Thu Nov 12 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: We're shinobi. Nothing should sound -insane-. - Thu Nov 12 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I've gained your trust by telling you I killed my parents and don't regret it. You didn't ask why I did it, but yet you trust me now. - Thu Nov 12 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: We're able to spawn fire in our stomach and not burn from the inside out.- - Thu Nov 12 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I didn't ask you that because that's your past. - Thu Nov 12 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: If you believe that then you are naive. - Thu Nov 12 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Asking you that is like asking you to relive something you don't want to remember. - Thu Nov 12 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Who says I don't want to remember it? - Thu Nov 12 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You are making quite a lot of assumptions. - Thu Nov 12 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) took another inhale from the blunt and now her fingers were feeling hot from how close the coal was.* - Thu Nov 12 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And you call me insane? Haha, you gained my trust by telling me something no one else probably knows. Not what you told me, just the fact that I know. - Thu Nov 12 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Besides, assumptions makes this fun. - Thu Nov 12 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A lot.. more fun. - Thu Nov 12 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Because then you learn more about me by me correcting you. - Thu Nov 12 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yes, ma'am.~ - Thu Nov 12 11:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Anyways.. I want to show you something.. then you tell me if you feel anything from seeing it. - Thu Nov 12 11:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright? - Thu Nov 12 11:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) took the last hit of the blunt and her eyes were very dialated by this point but it was difficult for any ordinary person to see in her dark iris, course Ortho was probably used to looking into eyes from those of his clan. She nodded to his question and statement then lifted the roach some in the air. "Do you recycle the last little bit into a new blunt or do you want me to toss it?"* - Thu Nov 12 11:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) blankly stared at him, "you can afford to so easily pass up recycles and share -another one-?" She shook her head in shock and snuffed out the roach beside her before releasing it into the grass. She wasn't sure why he was moving so close to her, she wasn't scared of him though and simply sat there and closed her eyes for a moment with a tight squeeze before reopening to make sure the high wasn't making her depthy perception go to shit, after all he had the good stuff. Seeing he really had leaned in closer she nodded...* - Thu Nov 12 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt his finger under her chin and the area tingled because of the high, when he closed his eyes she wasn't sure what he was doing really. As his eyes opened and she saw the eyes had shifted she wanted to jerk back away from him because she wasn't sure what she was seeing but some part of her told her not to move and to study them. Something about them called to her and while she was looking into those red eyes she did trust me, she trusted him with her life even and she didn't understand why. Her dark hue's explained it all and for the first time in her life she wasn't sure about something.* - Thu Nov 12 11:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes fluttered a bit as she tried to speak, "What is that..." finally sounded in a hushed tone.* - Thu Nov 12 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) kept her gaze on him since the eyes were still active, she couldn't look away. "Why does it .... feel familiar."* - Thu Nov 12 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's mind started clicking and she felt her face twitch as the high bothered her more now than it ever had in the past because she just wanted to be sober so she could function at one hundred percent. She stood up and was still unable to look away, "How could you know that is my birthright, why did you show me that.... who are you?"* - Thu Nov 12 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was feeling that craving alright, she could feel her mouth watering, her craving wasn't just to have whatever it was, it was to understand it, to feel it, to make it her own. How could her parents keep her from something like this, it only made their death's more deserved now that she was looking her destiny in the eye. She rolled her tongue around in the cotton mouth of her high and realized her mouth was not really watering but she had imagined it all in the lust of discovering who she truly was, she thought she had known but it was a false understanding. "How did you know to show me? There's nothing special about me, surely my family name wasn't enough or I would have heard of this before."* - Thu Nov 12 11:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt her face contorting as she darted towards him after having crouched to pick up the sap covered kunai in the grass. She was aiming to full on rush him onto his back to force the kunai to his throat. "You don't understand what this -means-." That is of course if she even managed to get him in that position.* - Thu Nov 12 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) snarled at him as she pressed the dagger tighter against his throat but not enough to cut flesh. "No you don't understand, you think you do but you don't, no situation is the same. I didn't kill my parents because I am evil or an idiot or insane, I killed them because they were abusive. I became a shinobi because they abused me, I became a shinobi because I had to learn how to protect myself and even then it wasn't enough, I plotted their deaths since I was eleven and never hated them through that entire time. Do you know how that feels to have to kill two people you -love- but it's a necessary cost for your survival? Loving the people who are going to be the cause of your death if you didn't put an end to it?! I waited all those years for the perfect way to get away with it and make it look like they were casualties of a riot, that way anyone who looked into it would be too ashamed of their own idiocy to do anything about it even if they found something!"

By now she was panting heavily, "And for you to tell me, that all along they were hiding something like -this-, that they had something that feels so right or perhaps they never earned it, but they had to have known about it! They knew about -this- feeling and were so hateful and deranged that they couldn't even share one shred of decency to inform their own daughter of her destiny?! Anything else they have done was already retified by their death's but there deaths weren't enough for what you have shown me today, they should have suffered for what they did to me and I gave them quick death's because of my love, this alone earned them the rights to the slowest death possible!" She was still panting, trembling even, silent now as she sat atop his waist and then pulled the dagger slowly away from his neck and dropped it at his side. She slowly looked up to the sky, trembling still as her eyes closed and she took in a deep breath of the air around her. The smell of maple, oak, and all the life around her being taken in with one inhalation. All of it was changed by one small flutter of Ortho's eyes opening to show her what she had been missing.* - Thu Nov 12 12:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) heard everything he was saying and how he was gripping about her waist.  She heard but wasn't truly listening as everything in the world faded away and all there was for her right now was her soul and the warm on her face from the sun hiding behind the clouds. Ortho continued speaking and all Eri did was sit atop him with head leaned back as far as possible, her hands went limp at her sides as if she was letting go from everything that had just been screamed towards the stranger who had rapidly become family. 

When he had pulled her chin down to look to him, her eyes were closed. He said his last few sentences to warn of the eyes coming too quickly for some and what it could do to them. The girl appeared as if she had passed out for a moment, it might even seem that way truly due to how lax her body had become. After a few more extended moments, Eri opened her eyes to peer down to the mysterious man who had unlocked the last passage of her history. He had opened a whole new world to her to come and there it was staring down at him with the blood red eyes filling out what once was dark. A line of black circling about her pupil and a tear drop forming to slowly rotate until it came to it's position on the upper right. She said nothing, did nothing, only stared down at him, in fact the only reason she was sitting up right was because he was still holding onto her waist to keep her in place.* - Thu Nov 12 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) nearly fell over when he loosened his grip on her but managed to lay her back on the ground without any issue. She lay there with her hands out to her sides whatever way they had landed and her legs bent at the knee with her feet under her rump forcing her hips upwards as he hovered over her. She wasn't moving at all but was clearly alive, just staring out with no actual place to look. she wasn't moving a muscle other than to breathe or to stare. No blinking, only staring. She was likely somewhere else, or perhaps she was really here and seeing the world differently in a way that had sent her into a shock, perhaps even she felt so enlightened she hadn't the need to move, speak, or blink. Instead she just stared and breathed on in total silence. By now the sap was done filling the bottle by far and the clone likely had already corked it and removed the tap from the trunk as sap oozed down the bark strips of the tree.* - Thu Nov 12 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) || Even with Ortho's attempts it wasn't enough to bring her back, the Sharingan within her eyes remained and stared up at him. Not even her name brought her back, for all intensive purposes he likely was going to assume she was gone unless he had gone to the same place she had and understood it might take some time.* - Thu Nov 12 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sat atop the man in utter silence and unmoving for the next two hours and some change. When she finally had reached a point where reality was coming back into focus, Eri slowly began to slump forward and within her eyes the tear drop circled and then slowly disapeared followed by the circle of black and pool of crimson. Her eyes now back to their dull black as she hunched forward and gasped out with a large breath. Her heart beat instantly picking up after having been so slow for an extended period of time and she trembled with a shudder as her hair hung down against Ortho's chest.* - Thu Nov 12 13:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was sitting under the tree on a blanket that was laid out. She was leaning against the tree with a small pillow behind her back. Eri was staring off at nothing and seemed like she was in a state of unawareness, likely she wasn't the one that even laid out the blanket or pillow.* - Thu Nov 12 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's brow twitched, then her nostril's flared. She was coming back to the world and felt as if she was drained heavily. "Nngnn..." she didn't speak words but she groaned so that was something?* - Thu Nov 12 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispered out something that wasn't audible unless he got closer to her lips. She still hung limp in his arms but trembling again as if she felt cold or was dealing with the shock of the situation. Her body ached also from the positions she had been lying or sitting in for the last few hours.* - Thu Nov 12 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispered against his cheek as he pulled her in closer, "that's one deep  business meeting."* - Thu Nov 12 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes fluttered closed and open again but she didn't laugh at his joke back, she couldn't laugh right now, far too tingly and numb at the same time. Whispering back against his cheek again, "call it professional for a girl to be sitting on your lap for devil knows how long?"* - Thu Nov 12 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) sighed out heavily as she leaned heavily against him, "I feel so tired..."* - Thu Nov 12 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes while leaning against him, "I don't want to rest....ugh..."* - Thu Nov 12 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Like I understand everything but nothing at the same time. - Thu Nov 12 21:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Then I will kill those who have betrayed my family. - Thu Nov 12 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: And if you make sure I survive...that means your survival...that's at least one member of family. - Thu Nov 12 21:58:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was still resting against him on his lap, "you don't sound like you have much faith left in your family."* - Thu Nov 12 22:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Should we go back into the settlement? - Thu Nov 12 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Yeah. Sure, sure. - Thu Nov 12 22:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....Yeah. - Thu Nov 12 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wasn't moving.* - Thu Nov 12 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) laid against his chest as he shifted her, likely at some point flashing the tree's but perhaps Ortho hadn't seen anything. She closed her eyes again, "thank you..." whispered out as she rested more.* - Thu Nov 12 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: We going to my house, babe. Let me rattle your mind.~ -omit- - Thu Nov 12 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: You want to be out here or in one of the houses? - Thu Nov 12 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) looked around, "I was never assigned a house." She peered around at people feeling weird that she was being carried bridal style with a skirt on but feeling too out of it to willingly walk on her own.* - Thu Nov 12 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You can have this one. - Thu Nov 12 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: This looks occupied. - Thu Nov 12 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's mine. I barely sleep in it so no worries. - Thu Nov 12 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...oh. - Thu Nov 12 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: But if it's yours I can't 'have' it. - Thu Nov 12 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: No no... can't do that. - Thu Nov 12 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was laid down and stared up at him with semi open eyes and dark circles beneath them.* - Thu Nov 12 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Because it's your house. - Thu Nov 12 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Why can't you just accept it? - Thu Nov 12 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Gift from me to you. - Thu Nov 12 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Because it's a -house-. - Thu Nov 12 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't see the big deal.~ - Thu Nov 12 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) grumbled and then felt too tired to argue. She rolled over, "can we talk about this later?"* - Thu Nov 12 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) had walked out of what was known to the public as Ortho's house, that probably didn't look the best... course they guards didn't mind they knew he was a lady killer and assumed he just had claimed her early on. Walking over to the closest tree with a blanket in hand she laid it out and sat down to lean against the trunk and stare up into the sky with her eyes closed. Before she could even close her eyes though, she spotted Ortho and took a moment watching him to figure out who was just floating up there. Putting two and two together she figured it was him from the statements a few days past about him flying.* - Fri Nov 13 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: where the fuck did my rp go] - Fri Nov 13 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stared at Ortho from her position wondering why he was just standing there floating. Finally she got bored of looking at him and looked to the clouds.* - Fri Nov 13 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Alright.. - Fri Nov 13 04:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Might as well get things started in Shinko.. - Fri Nov 13 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) flicked her dark gaze back onto Ortho. She didn't say anything for now and only watched waiting for others to speak.* - Fri Nov 13 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) 's eyes had remained on Ortho for a time before a certain part of his speech made her gaze twitch left and then down at her skirt and the blanket under her. She wasn't sure what it had to do with making people shinobi of this settlement but said nothing.* - Fri Nov 13 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) spoke up with clearing her throat first, "I'm staying..." That's all she would say and remained silent there after unless spoken to. She looked down at her Konoha headband, "I don't wish to remove the Konoha insignia though...I will wear both."* - Fri Nov 13 04:42:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes now just listening to the music, even if it wasn't a full blown song at first she still enjoyed the strumming of the guitar.* - Fri Nov 13 05:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) had questioned one of the guards, with a few threats, on where Ortho had gone. She slowly approached up the road but a good mile away the first thing she saw was Manda... Her eyes widened and for a moment she paused wondering if she should just leave because a giant snake? Come on... she had heard about the giant snake in Konoha but she had no idea it was attached to Ortho so that was an auto death penalty if she continued forward. Sneering at the serpant from the distance she shook her head at the second guessing and continued on towards the battle to see if Ortho was involved in anyway with this. Perhaps he was coming to fight Manda because he heard about it's presence popping up? Nothing could be certain... granted she was far enough off she likely wasn't going to be noticed unless a powerful sensor was among them due to her not wanting to even come close to being caught in the cross hairs.* - Fri Nov 13 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) approached closer as she spotted the two of them. She came to a pause when she could see a man in Sunagakure robes and Ortho in the distance. She had no idea where Paine was, didn't even realize she was there in fact. Instead all of her attention was on Yan and then the multitude of snakes trying to attack from Ortho's sleeves. "What the fuck..." whispered out as her hands remained at her sides and she simply watched.* - Fri Nov 13 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) inhaled sharply as she saw the red take over Ortho's eyes and stepped closer now unable to resist getting a closer look. She knew it was dangerous to get any closer but slowly she stepped out onto the grass and watched intently.* - Fri Nov 13 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) widened her eyes just as something was going to threaten her on the edge of an attack. She started to back peddle and then fully rolled in a twist onto the grass to get out of the way.* - Fri Nov 13 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) stood there watching as he had stopped so she assumed the man was dead, if Yan had fled far enough then Ortho might have looked different in spirit. She heard his comment and looked at him with a fairly casual expression. "Do you need to clean up before heading back?" She didn't even comment on the fact he had just killed someone.* - Fri Nov 13 09:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: He cares what I think of him quite a lot, clearly. - Fri Nov 13 09:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...for a moment I thougth you were going to say since you cleaned up. - Fri Nov 13 09:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Fri Nov 13 09:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shuddered dramatically.* - Fri Nov 13 09:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Cute. - Fri Nov 13 09:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...I don't do cute. - Fri Nov 13 09:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) turned to head South, "probably should wait to find a creek or river further South so you don't have to deal with the possibility there might be someone tracking him."* - Fri Nov 13 09:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...You sort of run the settlement I decided to call home, of course I care. - Fri Nov 13 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You oof. - Fri Nov 13 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Touche. - Fri Nov 13 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) kept on walking and looking for somewhere for Ortho to get cleaned up.* - Fri Nov 13 09:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) rose a brow at him and then laid down on the grass with her legs crossed at the ankle and stared up into the sky. "You wash, and I lay here, I'll even talk to you." She had looked as he removed his jacket but then again he walked around with his shirt off a lot so that wasn't all that interesting to see. She ended up seeing the scar and tattoo though and stared at that alone. "You'd think you would have tried something when I was on your lap, too much of a 'family' moment for you to try and 'get the girl'?"* - Fri Nov 13 09:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Fri Nov 13 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Man you really are a pervert. - Fri Nov 13 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Oi, listen. - Fri Nov 13 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Calm down with that. - Fri Nov 13 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) shook her head and smiled wide with her eyes closed.* - Fri Nov 13 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Trying to feel up my skirt. - Fri Nov 13 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You haven't seen perve- - Fri Nov 13 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Having me sit on your lap for hours. - Fri Nov 13 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Wait wait wait.. - Fri Nov 13 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Trying to get me to skinny dip with you. - Fri Nov 13 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Calling me a good girl. - Fri Nov 13 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Not to mention so -old-. - Fri Nov 13 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Hah. - Fri Nov 13 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's all the formula of a good time if you stopped playing hard to get.~ - Fri Nov 13 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just saying. - Fri Nov 13 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Pretty sure you are too old for me. - Fri Nov 13 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Excuse me? - Fri Nov 13 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Too old, you seem a lot older than me. - Fri Nov 13 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Haha.. - Fri Nov 13 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hahahaha. - Fri Nov 13 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, let's go with that. - Fri Nov 13 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) closed her eyes as he started to unbutton his pants, after all he was standing -literally- right next to her head.* - Fri Nov 13 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Hm? - Fri Nov 13 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Let's make a bet. - Fri Nov 13 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Guess my age right and I won't throw you in the water. - Fri Nov 13 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Fri Nov 13 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) took her NinjaTunes out of her pocket and laid it on the grass.* - Fri Nov 13 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm not certain. - Fri Nov 13 09:44:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....oh...eighteen? - Fri Nov 13 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt his pants hit the ground beside her head and her heartbeat started to pound. "S-seventeen?"* - Fri Nov 13 09:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Jackpot. - Fri Nov 13 09:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Okay maybe he isn't too old for me. - Fri Nov 13 09:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Now get your clothes off before I throw you in. - Fri Nov 13 09:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And make a decision. - Fri Nov 13 09:50:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) opened her eyes only to see partly up his boxers and then shut her eyes again. "Nng..."* - Fri Nov 13 09:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Why are you standing there? - Fri Nov 13 09:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Free country. - Fri Nov 13 09:52:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: She's brave as hell. - Fri Nov 13 09:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) had zoned out because of what she saw under his boxers, that would make any girl pause (Cough), but now she felt his arms against her and she screamed a little yelp. "W-woah okay hold on!" He was already carrying her and she didn't have a choice as she strarted forcing her boots off and they went flying as she tried to use her toes to get the socks off and was squirming in his hands trying to get at least her jacket and skirt off but likely her shirt wasn't going to be saved since it was very hard to get all that off in his arms.* - Fri Nov 13 09:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was glaring at him while holding her arms around her body. "I didn't want to even get in the water you prick, why do you gotta act like this, and I'm not taking my underwear off!" She made a little growling shriek and pulled her shirt off before walking into the water if only to be covered up from the depths.* - Fri Nov 13 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...what... - Fri Nov 13 10:05:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ..... - Fri Nov 13 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) grumbled and turned around but didn't go near Ortho. Everyone knew that wet boxers weren't going to hide anything for shit and she didn't want to go over towards him, especially not in her black panties and bra!* - Fri Nov 13 10:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) wrinkled her nose, "Why would I wanna?"* - Fri Nov 13 10:10:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You think you're cute. - Fri Nov 13 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Not fair. All because you are don't mean you have to call other people ugly. - Fri Nov 13 10:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll have you know.. I've met some waaaay uglier people before. - Fri Nov 13 10:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) frowned, "I'm not calling you ugly. You aren't ugly, far from it."* - Fri Nov 13 10:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....what offer? - Fri Nov 13 10:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) was watching him carefully and wondering why he was trying so hard, it didn't make sense, he wasn't trying this hard any other time.* - Fri Nov 13 10:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Earlier I said you talked like you would've let something happen. You didn't answer so I'm taking that as a offer. - Fri Nov 13 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .... - Fri Nov 13 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Well it wasn't. - Fri Nov 13 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You know it's funny. - Fri Nov 13 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You find out someone is from your family, crazy coincidence, and then you try to get her in bed. - Fri Nov 13 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ...Oi... - Fri Nov 13 10:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Don't put it like that.. - Fri Nov 13 10:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Hm?~ - Fri Nov 13 10:22:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's not even- - Fri Nov 13 10:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Look..- - Fri Nov 13 10:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Don't like thinking of me as family when you are looking at me in my panties huh? - Fri Nov 13 10:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ...... - Fri Nov 13 10:22:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: What ...are you ...doing? - Fri Nov 13 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Swimming. - Fri Nov 13 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Towards me... - Fri Nov 13 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Dooon't know what you're talking about. - Fri Nov 13 10:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) felt her heart racing, not because she liked him or anything...that was crazy, but because he was a man...partly nude in the water with her, behind her. "Sure you don't," she clenched her hands into fists not out of anger but control over her body so she didn't tremble. Turning quickly to face him...* - Fri Nov 13 10:26:46 2015
