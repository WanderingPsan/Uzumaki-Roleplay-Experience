<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: She just did something cool that I want to see. - Wed Dec  2 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I don't know where she is. - Wed Dec  2 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Damn it. Why aren't they heading to the gate? Ugh, I should have done this before taking that nap.  Unless...Oh fuck it.  - Wed Dec  2 03:10:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) whispers: You think I should ask about that thing you told me Ichiro? - Wed Dec  2 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) had no idea what was going on so she just kept blowing bubbles.* - Wed Dec  2 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) whispers: What thing? - Wed Dec  2 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Sanoke how you doing? - Wed Dec  2 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) whispers: The thing about information stuff. - Wed Dec  2 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) whispers: Specifically about a certain person, or peoples. - Wed Dec  2 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .. - Wed Dec  2 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Oh. - Wed Dec  2 03:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Oh, they didn't come when hearing about the maid cafe. I was hoping thats why they were around. - Wed Dec  2 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Doubt it. It ain't evne opened yet. - Wed Dec  2 03:20:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. - Wed Dec  2 03:21:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: ...Mm. - Wed Dec  2 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Chikyu had the bright idea -- Yeah. What she said. - Wed Dec  2 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I've got someone to suggest. It'll be fun! - Wed Dec  2 03:22:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. You okay, man? - Wed Dec  2 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: faggot - Wed Dec  2 03:22:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) blew a bubble and popped it as she watched Sanoke, who was obviously the leader of the village by his gear. She had on a huge cloak that covered majority of her body and looked rather like a civilian than any type of shinobi. She was leaning off with her weight on one hip and looked extremely bored.* - Wed Dec  2 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Whoever thought of such an idea, good job. - Wed Dec  2 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh cool. You're right, Chikyu. This might bring in a lot of business. - Wed Dec  2 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why is he standing in front of me.... - Wed Dec  2 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Oh right, I should ask about her before I forget. - Wed Dec  2 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: What guy doesn't like maids! - Wed Dec  2 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I don't know. Someone who doesn't enjoy the finer things in life, that's who. - Wed Dec  2 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Speaking of maids, Sanoke, have you heard of the name Makoto? - Wed Dec  2 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: This guy is alright with me, Sanoke. - Wed Dec  2 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Doesn't ring any bells, no. - Wed Dec  2 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Think anyone else might have heard the name? - Wed Dec  2 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Makoto? I haven't seen her forever. - Wed Dec  2 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: I'm working on a cool move hopefully I'll be able to show ya soon! - Wed Dec  2 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: What else? - Wed Dec  2 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: He sounds sort of freaking crazy asking like that. - Wed Dec  2 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) thinks: For once my paranoia seems to be beneficial. This guy's creepy. - Wed Dec  2 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Too much...They'll lock up. - Wed Dec  2 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: He questioned me too, don't sweat it... he's just a little off his rocker over the whole ordeal. - Wed Dec  2 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) shrugged non-chalantly.* - Wed Dec  2 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Righ' . . Well be careful, man. Came off as hostile. - Wed Dec  2 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Not the intention. - Wed Dec  2 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) lifted her right hand and waved---just one of her arms, the others were hidden of course.* - Wed Dec  2 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: What else do you know about her? - Wed Dec  2 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Why should I tell you information if you're too secretive to tell me -why- you want the information? - Wed Dec  2 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Clearly he needs to clean his ears out... - Wed Dec  2 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I just told you. I'm doing this for someone important. - Wed Dec  2 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: -omit- - Wed Dec  2 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: My apologies, I was referring to both moments at the entrance and when you spoke with blueberry. Stating our Kage knew of your visit. - Wed Dec  2 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: Yeah...... you're -too- enthusiastic about finding Makoto. Give me a -better- reason then "it's important to my friend". - Wed Dec  2 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) blew another bubble, of course if Sanoke had looked at her for more than two seconds scan he might have noticed that there was something seriously wrong with her body shape. Kari looked up to Chikyu and folded her gum back into her mouth and under her tongue. "Kuro-chan," she stated in a soft low voice.* - Wed Dec  2 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: One of them is pretty rude.. - Wed Dec  2 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Hm...handshakes with a shinobi. - Wed Dec  2 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Wait.... - Wed Dec  2 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Sooooo Technically they lied thier way into the village. - Wed Dec  2 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(VantetheGreat) thinks: And pissed me off - Wed Dec  2 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: ---And no, we didn't lie. - Wed Dec  2 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: We were under the assumption you still held the same Kazekage. - Wed Dec  2 03:50:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I was under the assumption that he was living in the village, since you told me he retired. - Wed Dec  2 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. Nah, Itold you he left too. But eh, misunderstanding. - Wed Dec  2 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: A reccomendation. - Wed Dec  2 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So, with the black cloak. You're not hot under there? - Wed Dec  2 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: To prevent further confusion. - Wed Dec  2 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Maybe a list of questions for your enforcer to ask. - Wed Dec  2 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: At the gate that is. - Wed Dec  2 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh? Nah. They probably shouldn't have even lt you in. - Wed Dec  2 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Usually, if people want to come to the village, they're forced to get a Visa pass. - Wed Dec  2 03:52:06 2015
