<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) continued to stare directly into Hideki almost as if she was staring into his very soul. She would bring her right hand up and ran her fingers down her cheek then would separate her hand from her cheek causing the mucus that her scales produced to create strands of mucus/slime between her fingers and her cheek. She would aslos gain the biggest grin possible.* - Wed Sep 16 17:53:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would momentarily stop the eye raping as she stretched her arms upward along with her feathers and yawned, those who would be close to her could make out two large fangs hidden within her mouth that would just be chilling there. When that was done she would refuse the eye rape like if it was the most normal thing in the universe "Oh Hideki~" she called out to him in an almost sadistic tone of voice "How about that spar~"* - Wed Sep 16 17:58:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) glanced over at Amai with a distinterested look then returned to eye raping Hideki, it is worth nothing that she is in her lycanthropic state at the moment.* - Wed Sep 16 18:12:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) glanced over at Amai again "Right, well I'll make sure you take it up the ass later for now I have something to deal with~" she would pay her full attention to Hideki who had stepped foward "Well I was wrong about you, you are not a pussy congrats." she commented as she pushed off the wall and extended her wings out to make herself seem larger "So let us begin." she said as she quickly dashed foward in a blur of motion that Ushinawa would be able to follow if he had his sharingan active and those who had good eye sight as well.

Appearing infront of Hideki she would stop and two massive white snakes would shot out almost instantly would of her back and wrapped themselves around Hideki's body constricting him and generally not allowing him to move or form handseals. She would grin at him as she licked her lips and proceeded to eye rape him from a much closer distance than she previously was before.* - Wed Sep 16 18:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: If I threw my shurikens, would they still make it to you, since you're charging forward at me? - Wed Sep 16 18:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hmph. - Wed Sep 16 18:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ....Yo. - Wed Sep 16 18:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Wait till I get MS ya fagget. omit - Wed Sep 16 18:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) brought her right scaly slimy index finger up to his lips and pressed it againt them indicating for him to be quiet "The fun has just began~" she said in a sadistic tone of voice "If I recall yesterday you said the winner would get the others jutsu yes? Well I won!~ And I would very much like to have my jutsus~" she would give a quick glance toward Ushinawa as she was physically touching Hideki then would return to focus her attention back on the male before her. It is also worth noting that her finger would be producing mucus constantly so he would not have the best of times with her finger being where it was.* - Wed Sep 16 18:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Once I get stronger.. - Wed Sep 16 18:35:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: ... - Wed Sep 16 18:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) kept that shit pressed against his lips so there was no talking for the poor male. Turning her head to look at Ushinawa she stood there silently thinking to herself if she was going to spar him or not and decided against ti in the end since she was a simple creature that only reacted when something happened to her. "I must decline that offer~" she told him as she returned her attention toward Hideki who still had the slimy finger on his lips "So, about my jutsus~" she continued where she had left off "If I let you go you will give them to me yes? Nod ones for a yes, shake your head twice for a no."* - Wed Sep 16 18:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I could try a headbutt. - Wed Sep 16 18:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would be standing there like a vegetable but inside her mind she would be having such a lively conversation with Hideki. The snakes who were not looking at Ushinawa stil held a tight grip around his body, of course that is if the genjutsu did not require eye contact. If it did then the snakes would join her in a vegetative state. It was very sad since the poor girl had the intelect of a new born jiraffe. In other words she would be under the effects of the genjutsu.* - Wed Sep 16 18:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) notes that Hideki has very slimy lips now.* - Wed Sep 16 18:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: *Comes back with MS and stares at Mariana* YOU DID THIS TO ME!! - Wed Sep 16 18:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: omit - Wed Sep 16 18:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) sadly she was still dumb as rocks so she would probably never- mind that she was broken out of the genjutsu by Zetsumo which returned her to reality leaving her confused as hell ".....What...huh?" it was clear that she was very dumb and lack the intelligence to recognize the genjutsu so this caused great confusion "...Wasn't... I....what?" she tried to make sense of it all but she could not.

One of her snaked coiling around Hideki's body would go up in a puff of white smoke as the kunai hit it, as for the other snake companion would be relatively fine unless Aiyana was a marksman and could curve the kunai. However she began to made the other snake go up in a puff of white smoke as she tried to make sense of it all.* - Wed Sep 16 19:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Release the snake. - Wed Sep 16 19:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) notes that Hideki is free to do whatever he wants now as he was not binded.* - Wed Sep 16 19:06:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What happened? - Wed Sep 16 19:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What jutsu do you want from me.. exactly? - Wed Sep 16 19:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I could have sworn I was giving Hideki the time of his life. - Wed Sep 16 19:07:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) glanced over at Zetsumo then at Hideki and finally at Aiyana who were all speaking to her "......What?" she was still stuck on the genjutsu part as she could not figure out what had happened.* - Wed Sep 16 19:08:48 2015

She used her speed to tackle him to the ground if possible "So you want to play this game huh~"* - Wed Sep 16 22:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) leaned closer to his face and flickered her snake like tongue at him "You are really kinky you know that~" she would then proceed to lick his cheek "It does not matter to me if you were going to cut it or not as I do not mind~" Oh how the tables turned on the poor male.* - Wed Sep 16 22:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would begin to twitch as the raiton chakra passed through her body which caused her to fall foward. If Hideki did not dodge then it would have been an involuntary headbut from her part as she had momentarily lost control over her body but thanks to Zeno's explination the effects would pass rather quickly as she slowly began to chuckle at first then as she got better and better she would begin laughing in a manaical way "That is the second time you have done that to me!" she screamed at him with a grin on her face "You are a very very bad boy Hideki~" she would tease at him as two snakes exited from the back of her cape breaking the string as they were anaconda sized snakes that began to wrap around Hideki stoping him from executing any handseals.

"Now how am I going to punish you Hideki?~ Would you probably like what I used to do to Amai? What do you think? Do you want to give it a try?~" She asked teasing him as she did not know if Amai had revealed what she would to her back when they were together.* - Wed Sep 16 22:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would use her snaked to pull him in closer to her and when he was before her the snakes would could around his body at a rather fast rate to stop him from doing any more handseals "Oh why not?~ She rather enjoyed it really, she would even beg me to do it to her~" Sitting down on his chest she would flicker her snake like tongue at him then stared at him in the eyes with her blue irises "I am sure that with enough time you will learn to love it as much as she did~"* - Wed Sep 16 22:38:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) leans foward to lick his cheek again "Come on Hideki~ You are so boring~ Where is that kinky side of you huh?~" She would begin bouncing on his chest.* - Wed Sep 16 22:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) tilted her head as she brought her hands up to remove her cape revealing her breasts to Hideki "Open wide~" she instructed him as her body slowly began to turn into its lycanthropic state as her skin began to be covered in scales "We can do this the easy way or the hard way~"* - Wed Sep 16 22:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) leaned in closer to his face staring into his eyes "One you open your mouth voluntarity or I can pry it open for you!~" she would then flicker she snake like tongue at him and she chuckled.* - Wed Sep 16 23:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would achieve her full transformation by now and would forcefuly insert her slimy finger into his mouth using both hand to keep his mouth open. She would chuckle as her pupils suddenly dialated and she opened her mouth directly above his. Her stomatch would compress several times before small strands of a white fluid would begin exiting her body, at first it was a small amount but as her stomath kept compressing more and more fluid would fall into his opened mouth. He had two option, to swallow or to swallow as she kept on pouring the liquid onto him. If he did not swallow the liquid would over flow from within his mouth but she did not care as she would continue pouring the stuff out since he would eventually have to swallow it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) stopped the flow of her fluid and closed his mouth shut with one hand then held his nose shut with the other so he would have to swallow it whether he liked it or not. Assuming that he would do it she would smile and let go of his nose to allow him to breathe, slapping his cheek twice softly she would stand up and release the snakes that were holding him down "Good boy~ Although you will still need to injest more fluid. If you want to know more feel free to come and ask me~" she would tease him as she reverted back into her human form putting on her cape when it was done.* - Wed Sep 16 23:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) kneeled down next to him and chuckled "You will undergo a transformation, It will not be pleasant and you need to keep receiving the fluid I just gave you a couple more times in order to achieve what I am." she infromed him as she ran her hand across his cheek caresing it "What I have given you could be considered more than a blessing so I would suggest you do not die soon ok?" she would slap him two more times in the cheek and started to walk off "Look for me when you feel like something is wrong."* - Wed Sep 16 23:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) notes that her whole attitude changed
* - Wed Sep 16 23:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would feel a sharp and burning sensation as her stomatch was cut into, since A she was no expecting the strike and B that she had the reflexes of a dead cat there was no way to dodge the strike. Since his objective was to slice and not maim she would stumble back a bit screaming in pain as this was the first time someone had given her a wound "Fuck!" she yelled out as she placed her hands over her stomatch but only found pain due to the burns the fire left "What the fuck!" she continued to yell out 

Her body began to tremble from the adrenaline that was coursing through her body causing her to enter her Lycanthropic state having her skin covered by scales, feathers forming a crest on her back and a chollar on her neck and wings to errupt from her shoulder blades. Moving backwards rather quickly she would use some of the blood that was that coming out of her stomatch and would smear it on her forearm but that is as far as she got as she looked foward to look at the attacker "What is the meaning of this?" she would ask cautiously.* - Wed Sep 16 23:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) was acutally rather far away from him at the moment. She would place a hand on her wound and groaned loudly "I do not harm him and he needs me now more than ever." she stated in a serious tone of voice "I made him better, whatever you were planning on teaching him I am giving him something better than that." she would groan again as the cut in her stomatch really caused a lot of pain to her "He will come to me, he need to continue with the process. It is for his own good." * - Thu Sep 17 00:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) began to laugh when he told her to undo what she had done. Shaking her head she would look at the trio at feet level and said "It cannot be undone, he is fine no harm has been done to him. Like I said he has receiving something that could be concidered a blessing." she would tell them as she winced in pain due to the cut >Damn, I need medical attention. This hurts too much.< she thought to herself before she focused her attention on the trio again "The only thing left to do is to  finish the process."* - Thu Sep 17 00:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: This was all my fault.. If only I was stronger.. And not so careless. - Thu Sep 17 00:25:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Some sort of fluid she had in her mouth, she basically forced me to swallow it. - Thu Sep 17 00:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Yeah, I'm not taking that. - Thu Sep 17 00:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: - - Thu Sep 17 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would begin walking toward the village as she thought that her own health took top priority. She would glance over at the trio and decided to stay quiet for a while as she made her way toward the village "Like I have said, he will come to seek me out and when the process is all said and done he will be better than what he is now." she would cough a bit as she began to revert to her human form "I would tell you what is going to happen to you but with your boyfriend attacking you I will leave it as a surprice. If you want to kill me think about what could happen to your kin if he does not receive his next dose of fluids."

As a reference she was looking at their feet as she was currently hunched over due to the cut in her stomatch* - Thu Sep 17 00:48:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) felt some of the pain ease up as she was being healed >Damn this hurts.< she thought to herself as she winced in pain as she could still feel some "Thanks." she told Mariana as she was not ungreatful. "You might think that I harmed him and I do not care if you do, just know that what I did to him will help him survive down the line. That 'filth' that I made him injest that was his first dose."* - Thu Sep 17 01:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) walked up the path that lead up to the mansion and yeah. Just stands there as she sees Ushinawa behind Niza and adopts a fight or flight stance.* - Thu Sep 17 20:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) was rather amazed as four earth spikes attempted to impale the shit out of Ushinawa. She would be even more cautious about her approach to the situation at hand since she could very well die here and that would not be good. Bringing her thumb up to her mouth she bit into it to the point where she drew blood from it and extended her right arm foward and smeared the blood across her forearm, once this was done she executed five handseals and slammed her palm on the ground causing a formula seal to appear on the ground bellow her.

A giant puff of white smoke would cover the area and when it dissipated she stood ontop of a giant purple snake. "What have you summoned here for?" asked Manda in a very condesending voice "You will pay for this you brat, I expect you to feed me one thousand humans or I shall make a snack out of you." Stomping her foot on the top of Mandas head she knew that it would not hurt the snake but she particularly disliked how he would speak to her "Oi enough we need to help him." she ordered the giant snake "I'll be sure to give you a nice meal but only after we have helped him. Do that for me and I will not bother you again for a long time to come." She began to take off her cape revealing her bare breasts and then something strange began to happen. Her skin began to change into a light green color as her skin was being replaced by scale and she began to grow feathers out of her neck and back. The feathers on her neck fromed a chollar as the ones in her back fromed a crest that went all along her spine. Out of her shoulder blades errupted two massive wings.

With that Manda moved swiftly moved toward where Niza and Ushinawa were and opened its giant mouth revealing a lot of very sharp teeth aiming to take a bite out of Niza. Hanabi having completed her Lycan transformation would use her speed to glide down safely due to her adjusting her feathers and flapped her wings accordingly to make her desent.* - Thu Sep 17 20:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: \ - Thu Sep 17 21:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) ||Sadly for Ushinawa Manda would remain on the battlefield untill her time was up so there was nothing she could do about it.

Manda would chomp into nothing but air as Niza had managed to move out of the way of the bite and straightened up to look at Niza and the surrounding area "You insolent fool!" Manda hissed at him as the giant purple snake was rather grouchy and believed everyone to be inferior to him "You will not get away nex-" he would turn his eyes would pick something up in his peripheral view and noticed Yan standing there "Ohh I guess he will do." With that he speed toward him slithering through the courtyard and opened his giant mandible to take a bite out of Yan and stick his giant fangs into his body. Unless Yan moved out of the way or by the graze of god was saved by something he would be dead as Manda did not have those pearly whites for nothing. If the bite was successful Manda would burry his fangs into his body most likely providing a swift dead to the poor male.

Hanabi would watch this and screamed at the top of her lungs toward Manda "Oii! We are leaving!" she would tell the snake as she would quickly retreat using her outstanding speed to make her way out of the village >Well this was uneventful.< she thought to herself as she quickly raced across the village glancing back to look at the burning mansion and giant purple snake >I hope that snake listens to me.< * - Thu Sep 17 21:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) whispers: (Watch me get cheesedxD) - Thu Sep 17 21:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) \\ Manda: Burrows underground after having missed the bite and made its way under the mud rivers that were flowing toward him. Since he moved at the same speed regardless if he was moving above or under the ground he would JAWS Yan as he emerged from the ground closing his jaws ones he was within range and sunk his giant fangs into Yan then went back down toward the ground and  burrowed away. Since Manda saw where Yan was as he jumped back and he saw him do the clones he had a good idea as to who the real Yan was.

Now that Niza has implemented his RP I am forced to change what I wrote so yeh. \\Manda having felt the weight of someone on his tail and reacted almost on instinct as he had now found a new target. "You dare touch me!" Manda hissed at Niza as he coiled his body around Niza aiming to squeeze the life out of Niza using his powerful muscles to contrict the male who had dared touch him "Suffer!" he hissed again as he would continue to coil his body around Niza to try and make his escape near to impossible. Finding himself in the embrace of the snake Niza would be in a very touch situation.

(For refrence the post about Yan is omited since Niza takes priority since he is attacking Manda and next RP round is mandas last round on the battle field.

P.s. I was too lazy to delete the yan post to deal with it.)* - Thu Sep 17 21:59:53 2015

Getting ontop of him she would be sitting on his chest and would lean foward, naturally her breats would hang right before his face "Open wide." she told him with a changed demeanor as she was no longer teasing him and was actually dead serious for those rare occasions such as this.

Took a couple of steps back from where Zetsumo was, of course by a couple of steps it was actually a few meter to the south west of where he was. She would bring her hand up to her mouth and bit down into her thumb and smeared the blood into her forearm. Forming five handseals she would slam her palm into the ground bellow her and had a formula seal appear around her palm and in a puff of white smoke appeared a giant purple snake who was not in the best of moods

Manda "You dare summon me again?"

Hanabi "I need you to give the Alpha a status report on what happened in Konoha.....he can also supply enough food for you to eat."

Manda "I want more than one-thousand sacrifices now!"

Hanabi ".....well I mean...Sure~" 

Manda would hiss and approache Zetsumo "Who are you puny human?" Manda asked a question that sounded more of a demand to know who he was.* - Thu Sep 17 23:49:58 2015

I have no master." said Manda rather angrily. Closing his mouth and flickering his snake tongue at Zetsumo he would move his head from left to right keeping him in his sights "For a puny human you  do not show fear." said Manda "Either you are trying to act like something you are not or you might be more powerful than me." He began to laugh as soon as he said that "Impossible, you are cowering in fear." he would look around the place spotting several people leaning against a wall and would promptly move over to them to examine each and every one of them as he flickered his tongue at them "You all seem tasty." he commented as he moved back toward Zetsumo " I was denied of my meal, there were two humans fighting a black haired one." he began to tell the tell of the battle that had taken place in Konoha "The white haired one was fast- no I simply let him go then noticed a yellowed hair human standing there. I was on my way to eat him when the White haired one dared touch me. The black haired Human who this brat was supporting seemed to be taking care of the white haired one but I decided to constrict him as he dared touch me, from there I do not know as my time was up." * - Fri Sep 18 00:14:43 2015
