<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) got up from her bed and went to the bathromm where she splashed water on her face and looked at herself in the mirror >Bad hair day.< she thought to herself as she attempted to fix her hair. Once she did she went back into the room and did not bother getting dressed as she well she did not plan on going out at least not yet. She would snap her fingers and Hakaze would slither to her making her way up Hanabis leg, torso and finally coiled around her arms stretching through her back. With a single look she told her what to do and Hakaze did it, she would begin regurgitating a blade* - Mon Aug 31 15:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) reached over for the blade and pulled it out completely, she would examine the blade to examine it >Hmmm, looks different from the one that Tayuya had but I am sure I can work with this.< she thought to herself  as she grabed it with one hand >Hmm feels heavy.< she would then tilt the blade foward and swung it slowly at first to see if she could handle the blade but since she was no expert the balde fell out of her hand making a 'CLINK" as it hit the ground >Well then, looks like I have a lot of work to do.< she thought to herself as she bent over to pick up the blade.* - Mon Aug 31 15:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) holding the blade now with two hands now she would glance over at Hakaze "Oh shut it." she told the snake as it flickered its tongue at her "Like you would do any better." she commented once again chuckling after as she imagined a snake with two arms holding a sword. After she was done with that mental image she focused on the blade now, she felt its weight now that she held it with both hands and now it was a bit lighter as she could support it better now that her two hands were grabing it "Well here goes nothing." she muttered as she raised the sword and brought it down with very little control.* - Mon Aug 31 15:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) ||>Fuck.< she thought to herself as she was not expecting the blade to become that heavy when she swung it foward >Well that is something to take into consideration for next swing.< she thought to herself as she slowly brought the sword up and held it infront of her chest with both hands. She took in a deep breath before bringing the sword up once again and bringing it down this time taking into consideration that the blade would become heavier as it was being swung due to the principles of gravity and such. She would stop the blade once her arms would not extend or travel down any more.*)* - Mon Aug 31 15:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Every one has their quirks I guess - Sat Sep 12 12:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) followed the female up to the locker rooms and well did not really bother to pick out a bathing suit since she had never worn one before and well had never been in a hot spring so she really did not know how things worked exactly. She would walk up to a locker and observed Katsune open it said locker and watched as she took off her clothe but not because she was a pervert but because she wanted to see what she was going to do since this was her first time going to such a place.

After watching Katsune store her stuff away she began to undress taking off her pants but leaving on her panties and cape since she wore no bra under it for reasons that shall remain unknown to anyone that has not previously seen her fight. "So." she simply said as she sat down on a bench that was presumably there "What does one do in a place like this?" she asked Katsune as she looked around the place "Does anything special happen here? Or is this a common gathering point?"* - Sat Sep 12 12:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) did not bother to hide the fact that she was staring at the naked Katsune "Massages? Food and Sake huh? Do you think they give out mice?" she asked as she leaned back a bit using her hands as a support against the bench and crossed her legs "Some mice would be nice right about now." She really did not know that anyone asking for mice would be considered wierd so if Katsune reacted in a strange maner she would not know why it was exactly perhaphs it was the eye raping that was going on? Who knew.* - Sat Sep 12 12:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) continued to watch as she was getting dressed and shifted her legs crossing them over ones again as she saw Katsune get anxious >Well this day has been better than the past month combined.< she said to herself as she continued to watch looking at her body in all its glory "Well I have to feed Hakaze and she cant really gain anything from massages or sake...and the only food she eats are mice so yeah."

She would lean foward now that Katsune was dressed >Tch, well I enjoyed it.< she said to herself as she conitnued ot stare at the kunoichi before her "Nice body." she commented toward her as she stood up and stretched her arms upward revealing some under boob "So what now? Do we just stay here and stare at each other or something?" It was more than obvious that she had never attended a spa before.* - Sat Sep 12 12:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can ask about the mouse after that, I guess. - Sat Sep 12 12:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We'll be in a tub. - Sat Sep 12 12:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A hot one. - Sat Sep 12 12:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: With Kilm, since we're being nice. - Sat Sep 12 12:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) tilted her head a bit "Bikini? What is that?" she questioned her as she brought her hands down from the stretch if she hadn't already done it " So it will be the three of us in warm water? That is very nice." she commented as she was rather fond of warm things "I am guessing that Kilm is that guys name right? Shouldn't we go? I am sue that he is waiting by this point."* - Sat Sep 12 12:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Um...yeah. Alright. - Sat Sep 12 12:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would follow after Katsune walking slowly behind her as le eye rape was still going on since she had seen what was underneath the bathing suit she wore. Ones she entered the room after her she would look around being fairly impressed "This is nice." she commented as she watched Katsune test the water with her foot "How is the temperature?" she asks as she takes a stroll around the room examening everything in it as this was a new experience for her.

* - Sat Sep 12 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ...Eyes off, before I test how durable you are when my lightning's run through water. - Sat Sep 12 13:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But you look cuter now. - Sat Sep 12 13:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) watched the two interact "Hmm." she simply said as she took off her cape and breather and placed them somewhere they would not get wet but still relatively close by for her to get them if she needed them. She would enter the water with exposed breasts and all and sat there enjoying the warm water.* - Sat Sep 12 13:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I shall begin saying my prayers. - Sat Sep 12 13:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) submerged into the water getting her hair wet then emerged "This feels nice~" she commented toward the two who were in the room with her "I did not know such a place existed~" she would go on saying as she placed her back against the wall of the tub and brought her arms out enjoying the moment. It was also more than obvious that she had no trouble showing her body as she did not have a concept of 'shame' or 'modesty' thanks to her up bringings.

Looking at Katsune she tilted her head "Why do you wear that?" she asked her "WHy not let yourself be free? " she was clearly refering to her bathing suit. As far as Klim went she really did not care if he would stare at her or not.* - Sat Sep 12 13:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm - Sat Sep 12 13:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And what might those reasons be? - Sat Sep 12 13:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It feels so good to not be constricted by anything. - Sat Sep 12 13:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If...you're naked, then people are gonna think it's okay to be all over you. - Sat Sep 12 13:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: So hard not to look at Katsune. This is a challenge. - Sat Sep 12 13:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ...Or...something. - Sat Sep 12 13:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: That is why you defend yourself. - Sat Sep 12 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Sep 12 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah...okay. - Sat Sep 12 13:30:01 2015

Or are you guys from another place?" She would begin to use her index finger to run circles on Katsunes shoulder.* - Sat Sep 12 15:19:15 2015

Following after the spa person, Katsune and Klim she entered a room with three tables in it, she watched as Katsune and Klim layed down on them "Hmm are we supposed to lay down on them? Or do we sit?" 

She began to move toward the free table and examined it "Do I lay down face up or face down?" she continued to ask as this was her first time ever recieving a massage "Im going to lay face up." she commented as she got on the table and looked at the ceiling above her "You two seem awfuly quiet you know but I guess that is what happens when you first meet someone right?"* - Sat Sep 12 15:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) closed the gap between her and Amai faster than she could draw the thing and just like that a massive white anaconda like snake emerged from within her cape to stop Amais movements as it quickly coiled around her body tightening slowly to constrict her of air "Tell me 'Darling' have you continued to take it up the ass? Has anyone in this village fucked you like I have?" she would ask trying to get Amai even more pist off than she already was since Amai would be more than likely captured by her technique considering her speed and the lack of handseals involved in the technique.* - Sat Sep 12 21:56:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) had caught Amai in her snake bind but released her afterward since she really was more of a lover rather than a fighter "Tch, says the person that tried to have me killed. Tell me would you have stayed if I would have tried to kill you? We were doing just fine untill you decided to fuck it up." she would back away as she knew what Amai was capable of doing with that ink as she had seen what had happened to Maloth so she was not going to be about that life for the time being "I fail to see how I am a whore when I choose survival instead of death. Come on now I am sure you still miss me you know you loved receiving your present for being a good girl." 

She would keep her eyes on Amai as she brought up her thumb and bit down into it drawing blood from it, this was done just incase she wanted to do what Hanabi feared she might do so this was insurance for such an occacion. It is worth nothing that Hanabi was wayy the fuck back so IC positioning will not equal the character models positioning since I would not be able to see what other people have to say.* - Sat Sep 12 22:19:05 2015

Bullshit a phase is wearing different clothing and not getting home untill dawn, what you did was not a phase you tried to have me killed for whatever reason but you know what I am over it as well I am alive to this day and so are you. So let us both drop what was in the past and continue on with out merry lives, who know if you are a good girl I can give you a present~ Wouldn't you like what 'Daling'?"  

She was mainly unaffected by her words as well she really did not care for what Amai had to say about the situation since she did what she thought was right and would gladly defend that point over and over again even if it ment beating on a dead horse. Bringing her hand down with blood still falling from her thumb she continued to look at Amai "Come on now Amai you know you still want to get presents~ Have you forgotten how good it made you feel~? Remember with how much pleasure you used to tell me you were a good girl~" it was more than clear that Hanabi did not care if people heard what she did to Amai since well she had no sense of Modesty what so ever.* - Sat Sep 12 22:31:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) watched as there were roasted ink gods before her eyes. If Zetsumo had not interfered things would have turned uglier than they already are. Speeding away to avoid the combo that took down the Ink creatures he returned and looked at Zetsumo as she believed that he had addressed her "I take it you are the alpha of this group." she comment as she wiped the blood away from her thumb now that the crisis was over " I know but what can you do about it you know? Also I take it that she is your prisoner since she said she was captured although I do not understand why you would give her ink since her abilities are all based on the usage of said thing." She was not questioning Zetsumos methods as he had just flexed infront of her and she was rather amazed by the show of power that had just happened before her eyes as she had seen what those ink creatures could do to someone and knew they were relatively hard to take down.* - Sat Sep 12 22:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would have normally under most circumstances challenged what Zetsumo said but she was rather swayed by the power he had exhibited before her so with very little hesitation she dropped to a knee as she knew this was the kind of person she wanted to be around with.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: <*Yawns*> Have my people look around the area. - Sun Sep 13 01:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: What the hell... - Sun Sep 13 01:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: He may have evacuated the gvillage by now. But it is worth a check. - Sun Sep 13 01:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Why am I..? - Sun Sep 13 01:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Just incase he isn't setting up traps. - Sun Sep 13 01:15:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: How did you restrain me..? - Sun Sep 13 01:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well this day surely has been interesting. - Sun Sep 13 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: This day is getting worse and worse for me... - Sun Sep 13 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: First that gezo shit head turns up. - Sun Sep 13 01:18:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) walked over toward Katsune "Soooo another spa trip?~"* - Sun Sep 13 01:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. . . - Sun Sep 13 01:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Ugh...The world can just fuck itself today.... - Sun Sep 13 01:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yes? No? maybe? - Sun Sep 13 01:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So what's all this shit about? - Sun Sep 13 01:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'd kindly like to leave this place and move on if you don't mind. - Sun Sep 13 01:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Ushinawa what happen? - Sun Sep 13 01:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) went off to the spa with Katsune following behind her.* - Sun Sep 13 01:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (PolicePassword) - Sun Sep 13 01:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) entered the spa reception area and walked up to the receptionist but looked over at Katsune "What do you want to do?" she asked her curious as to what type of package deal she would want "Same thing as last time?"* - Sun Sep 13 01:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Was there anything 'you' really wanted to try? - Sun Sep 13 01:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've done everything here now, counting massages. - Sun Sep 13 01:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well this would be the second time I come here. - Sun Sep 13 01:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: If you could order I could pay. - Sun Sep 13 01:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: There is no problem with that. - Sun Sep 13 01:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Sun Sep 13 01:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) ordered whatever it was that Katsune ordered last time and payed up front. She would glance back at Katsune then looked back at the receptionist "Make sure there is a bottle of Sake waiting for the lady when she gets to the water." she requested then turned to look at Katsune one more time "Well lead the way." she said with a smile on her face* - Sun Sep 13 01:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) followed after her and entered the locker room and took off her boots "You know today has been a very interesting day." she commented as she took off her pants and respirator "I found my ex girlfriend here of all placed and she tried to kill me." she could chuckle after that then stood up and stretched now that she remained in her panties and cape revealing her under boob yet again "And two people from Kirigakure showed up today which was odd but that just made the day that much more interesting."

She would hone in on the undressing Katsune with her eyes yet again enjoying the show even if it wasnt a show she would consider it as so "You seriously have a nice body." she commented as she reached for her panties and took them off placing them with the rest of her belongings "Now that your friend is not here I can enjoy myself that much more." she told Katsune as she took off her cape now being fully naked before her.* - Sun Sep 13 01:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) sat crossed leggedas she waited for Katsune to finish getting dressed and ones she did she stood up and walked toward the door that lead to the bath area "What about you? Have you had any romantic interests before?" she might have been asking too much of a personal question but then again she had dumb as rocks and had no sense of modesty so the question seemed perfectly normal. If Katsune would to let her eyes wonder since she was completely nude she would be able to tell that Hanabi took care of her pubic rather well as it was well trimmed and maintained but then of course she would only notice this if she let her eyes wander a bit too far down.* - Sun Sep 13 02:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) walke dwith her hands locked behind her back as she glanced back at Katsune "You killed him huh? That must have sucked." she commented as she opened the door toward the baths/pool/ whatever the fuck passes as the spa thing and enetered the room "Well that is all in the past just like me and my ex-girlfriend you know? She tried to get me killed for whatever reason so I dumped her ass rather quickly and had not seen her until this very day." Turning to face Katsune now with her hands still locked behind her back she would smile at her "Well we are here~" she said happily as the difference in room temperature was noticeable at least to her who was inside the room.* - Sun Sep 13 02:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 13 02:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It is in the past. - Sun Sep 13 02:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) looked around the room trying to spot the sake bottle "Hmmm, do you see it anywhere?" she asked Katsune "I am sure that I ordered a Sake bottle for you but I do not think they have delivered it." she would begin to walk round the room for a bit "I might be wrong though."* - Sun Sep 13 02:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) shook her head and entered the water assuming it was safe enough to enter since Katsune was already inside. She would sit down and cross her legs as she slowly sank into the water "This feels good~" she would say out loud for Katsune to hear "You know I once spent five years sitting in a pond of cold musky water, it was not fun nor was it pleasant but hey I will take this over that any time of day~" it should have been pretty clear that she had a few screws loose in her head with all the randomness and the way she acted.* - Sun Sep 13 02:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) nodded her head and looked at the ceiling "Yeah, it was in a dark cave and I was constantly nagged by that geezer it was well worth it in the end." She would beging to kick slowly in the water as she uncrossed her legs with her feet occasionally breaking the water and showing up in the surface "But it was thanks to that geezer that I was able to progress further with my abilities so I can't really complain about that...however! What the hell! He made me sit there meditating for five years...given it was not consecutively as I had to tend to the basic body functions but still!" 

She would look back at Katsune to see what she was doing "What would you have done if you were forced to spend a long time sitting in a cold pond with nothing but your own body heat to keep you going?"* - Sun Sep 13 02:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'I' was forced to carve up little girls like they were thanksgiving dinner, and then murder them. - Sun Sep 13 02:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For no other reason than Zetsumo wanting me to be headstrong. - Sun Sep 13 02:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ..Not that it was that bad. - Sun Sep 13 02:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Ohhh~ - Sun Sep 13 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Fun~ - Sun Sep 13 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 13 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: After a while, carving up the pretty ones got fun. - Sun Sep 13 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There was something about it. . . - Sun Sep 13 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I would have taken that over being forced to sit in cold water. - Sun Sep 13 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah... - Sun Sep 13 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well that made you who you are today. - Sun Sep 13 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 13 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Which is nice. - Sun Sep 13 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Wouldn't you say so? - Sun Sep 13 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anything's better than being on the side of the self-righteous people that are fighting Zetsumo, I guess. - Sun Sep 13 02:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 13 02:51:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Do you think he has use for someone like me? - Sun Sep 13 02:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) lived under a rock literally for the duration of the TS so she is not really aware of current events.* - Sun Sep 13 02:52:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) stood up and stretched her arms upward and got out to ring the bell calling the spa staff over. After a few moments the same lady that had handled them the last they had been there walked into the room gaining an even more flustered expresion as she was now completly nude now "More sake for my lady friend here please~" The lady would just sigh as she blushed and left the room.

Turning her attention back toward Katsune she entered the water and sat next to her "Soo~ What do you want to talk about? You are still not that talkative and I am starting to think that there might be something wrong with me" she would chuckle a bit after saying that.* - Sun Sep 13 03:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmmm. - Sun Sep 13 03:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would bring up her hand to poke Katsunes neares cheek "Poke."* - Sun Sep 13 03:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) pokes her cheek ones again and shook her head "No, I try to avoid fights as much as I can for the time being. I spared a couple of times here and there but nothing too serious, half of the time I ended up just quiting the spars because I either lost interest or did not want to show anyone what I could do."* - Sun Sep 13 03:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. . . - Sun Sep 13 03:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well, not always... - Sun Sep 13 03:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) backed away from Katsune to let her drink in peace "I've lost just about every spar. What can you do?"* - Sun Sep 13 03:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Everything.... - Sun Sep 13 03:16:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No one is, cept for Kuro...and he's dead. - Sun Sep 13 03:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmmm. - Sun Sep 13 03:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I guess the only way to know who is faster is through a race. - Sun Sep 13 03:18:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Aaand explosion release. That's a secret though. Don't tell anyone.... - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Explosion? - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's so good.... - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: First time I've heard of such a thing. - Sun Sep 13 03:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd show you, but it's loud. - Sun Sep 13 03:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm - Sun Sep 13 03:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I gues since you are telling me what you can do I gues sits only fair I show you mine. - Sun Sep 13 03:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Sun Sep 13 03:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) stood up and looked at Katsune "Just be sure not to tell anyone about this." she commented toward her as she closed her eyes. She would slowly begin releasing the nature energy stored up in her body, opening her she looked at Katsune with slitted yellow eyes as her skin began to change into scales that would cover her whole body. Around her neck she would begin to grow a collar of lively colored feathers that ranged from red, green, orange etc.etc etc. The feathers would form a crest along her spine as she hunched foward as two bulges began to form where her shoulder blades were as moments later two massive wings would errupt from them which allowed her to stand up straight again. When the transformation was done she would move out of the water since she did not want to get her feathers wet and the secretions that her new scaly skin had would make the water into a sort of mucus.

Looking down at Katsune she spread her wings and smilled at her as the feathers in her collar ruffled up "So~" she simply said as she waited for Katsunes reaction "This is why I had to sit in cold water and I think it is pretty kick ass wouldn't you agree?" * - Sun Sep 13 03:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would use one of her wing feathers to poke her cheek only this time from a farther distance "Poke." she said chuckling afterward "The wings and feathers come in handy sometimes." she said as she was crouching down with her wings retracted on her back to keep them from getting wet since they were relatively large wings. The feathers that served as a cholar would settle down some against her back and some against her shoulder " This is just a fraction of what I can do though~" she teased at Katsune who was still in the water "I hope to be able to progress further into my transformation as time goes by."* - Sun Sep 13 03:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you're good at it, that is. - Sun Sep 13 03:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've been working on my ninjutsu. Bet I can hurt Kilm now. . . - Sun Sep 13 03:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) having no sense of modesty what so ever she did not realize that she was doing anything that can be considered wrong "I need to get stronger, I can only keep this up for so long but I do not want to rely solely on this as well this would just makes me a target since I can be clasified as a 'freak' by some." She would close her eyes and began to revert back to her human form and when all her feathers and scales had returned to normal skin she entered the water and submerged getting her head wet then came out " I wish to learn Kenjutsu as I also wish to get better in the usage of the Katon element you know? I want to be useful. I want to be an alpha."* - Sun Sep 13 03:54:27 2015
