<br><br><font color=yellow>*Haku(Iron Zorro) Brought his hands up to his chest and took in a deep breath of air as he cleared his mind >I am sick and tired of just standing around, all I do is do nothing but stare at the water or talk to Eiyu. What the fuck, all he talks about is doing things for what could be considered for the greater "good". Foolish ideals but to each their own.< Beginning to send chakra up to his palms, he would continue to take deep breaths > Better get started.< he told himself as he closed his eyes  and focused on his task at hand.

>Infuse Raiton into your chakra, focus the shape of the shape, it will be a ball but make sure to make it decent enough size while keeping in mind your current chakra pool.< Spreading his hands apart slightly he would begin to send out his chakra to the space that was created between his hands >Mold it into a ball, slowly begin to build it up. Create it through your hands and control your chakra.< He took a deep breath of air as he was doing and thinkig this, he would remain focused on controlling and molding his chakra so that it would have to maintain its current form

>Begin expanding it, send the proper amount of chakra toward the small ball that you have created. Once you have done make sure that you keep the shape of the ball for a while before you decide to send it off toward whatever target you choose.< Slowly separating his hands a bit more the small ball of raiton infused chakra would grow a bit bigger and would begin crackle and spark as more Raiton and chakra was being poured into the jutsu that he was in the process of creating at the current moment and that was building up infront of him in the space that was created between his hands.

Separating his hands a bit more he would pour more Raiton infused chakra into it >Keep an eye out on your chakra pool, do not over exhert your chakra so that you do not end up like the last time during your spar with Hachirou were you could barely stand up after the spar was over.< Hearing the crackling of the Raiton infused chakra ball, he would separate his hands more and more until the ball was of a decent size to where he considered it worthy enough to be launched. >Pick your target wisely and remember that in the future, targets will be on the move so it will not be as easy to hit them as it is right now.<

Keeping the ball between the gap that separated his hands he would scan around the area for a proper target >Hmmm, I do not want to launch it at the water because of the risk of killing the wild life that lives within the water, which would not benefit anyone since my eels need to feed on the fish that live there.< Deciding to target the same wooden post that he had decided to target days prior and launched the ball toward it having it slam against the wall causing some sort of damage to the wood. >Good enough for today, tomorrow I will continue my training since standing around and doing nothing is becoming very annoying real quick.<* - Tue Nov 17 22:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Haku(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah.. - Thu Nov 19 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Haku(Iron Zorro) Arriving at the lake /  pond thing that was located in the bottom part of Kumogakure he would look arond the area to see if he would spot Eiyu or Hachirou since they all usually hungout near the body of water. >Hmmm, they are not here, oh well.< he thought to himself as he began to kneed and mold his chakra inside of his lungs >Lets practice with Katon now since I have practiced enough with Raiton and I do not want to fall behind with my Katon natured release. It would be a good thing to be proficient in all aspects, be it Raiton, Katon, taijutsu and so forth and so on.<

Continueing to mold and kneed his chakra in his lungs he would look at the water and brought his hands up to perfom a handseal so that he could execute the technique whne it was ready to be resealed. >Katon is tricky.< he thought to himself >I cannont mold it inside of my body since it requires me to expell the chakra out of my body in order to be able to execute the technique and control the chakras shape, meaning that my chakra controll needs to be spot on so that I will not have any trouble controlling the jutsu and keeping the shape of this jutsu. It is the most basic of Katon type jutsus out there so it should not be that difficult.<

Inhaling deeply he would infuse the chakra that was being kneeded and molded within his lungs into the air that was coming into his system and would continue to hold the handseal so that he could activate the jutsus when he was ready to do so. Once the air left his body the Katon natured chakra would begin to ignite the air and it would create a small stream of fire that he would control with his chakra. >Keep it focused.< he thought to himself > Do not let it get out of control and do not lose the shape of it, I know this is harder than it looks but you can do it.< he told himself in motivation to keep whatever control he had on the flame stream >Do not lose control of the shape, you can do this.< he reassured himself.

Continueing to spew out the fire he would find it hard to keep up since the technique was limited to the capacity of his lungs >Damn.< he thought to himself as the technique came to an end because of the air being used up within his lungs. >Now there is an even greater limitation since I need to have a great amount of lung capacity in order to keep this technique up for a long time, shit. What a fine handy cap, if I want more jutsu time I need to work on getting more air into my system which would be more or less impossible since well..fuck that.< Breaking the handseal he would begin to inhale deeply again as he formed the handseal once again to kneed and mold the chakra within his lungs.

>One more time.< he thought to himself as he exhaled the air that he had accumulated within his lungs and created the stream of flames once again as the chakra infused Katon left the air along with the air >Same thing as before.< he told himself as he exhaled >Keep the stream in control, check your chakra levels and keep the chakra within the jutsu in a set path or direction. Do not let it get out of control.< Nearing the limit of air that were in his lungs he stopped the technique and broke the handseal >Good enough for now, I shall continue this at a later date since I have much to learn still.<* - Thu Nov 19 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Haku(Iron Zorro) Once again finding himself infront of the lake / pond thing he would let out a small sigh since he had spent most of his day doing absolutely nothing other than standing around and staring at the water infront of him >What a waste of time, I have become less productive ever since I have started speaking with other people. How infuriating.< Kneeling down to look at his reflection in the water he would sigh once again and stood up >Infuriating.< he repeated as he then began to clear his mand. Bringing his hand up, he would perform six handseals Rat ---> Tiger ---> Dog ---> Ox ---> Rabbit ---> Tiger and inhaled as deeply as he could trying to get as much air into him as possible.

>This next jutsu requires me to create individual balls of fire that I can control with my chakra so it will require me to hold the shape of the individual balls I create. Now, how many balls I create is completely up to me and my chakra pool so I have to keep that in mind.< Kneeding and molding the chakra in his lungs as well as infused the chakra with Katon he would think to himself >Start off by forming one or two balls of fire first so that you can get the hand of the jutsu and so that you know what to expect when you take it more seriously. Also make sure to have the target in mind since striking the wooden post wont do you anygood and might cause a fire in the village.<

Beginning to exhale he would create a small fireball that would be snet forward to travel above the water. >Keep it in control, kepp the shape of the fireball.< he thought to himself as he controlled the fireball making it do a right turn as it continued to travel above the water then had it do a vertical turn causing it to go up into the sky >This is harder than it looks. I do not think I  can keep it up for much longer.< At that moment he would begin to lose control of the fireball causing it to fall down into the water. Once the fireball impacted the water it would cause steam to rise due to the evaporating water.

>Damn it.< he thought to himself as he broke the handseal, inhaling and exhalining normaly he would tink >This is not a eas as I thought it woud be, my chakra control leaves much to be desired but that is something that I am training for and is part of the reason why I am doing this. One day I will be able to get this done without even struggling..when that happens I will be able to do much much more without even breaking a sweat.< Bringing his hands up and inhaling deeply to prepare to execute the jutsu one more time he would begin kneeding and molding chakra inside of his lungs so that he could repeat the process that he had done moments before.

Executing six handseals Rat ---> Tiger ---> Dog ---> Ox ---> Rabbit ---> Tiger as he kneeded and molded his chakra inside of his lungs he would exhale the air out creating a single fireball one more time. Holding and controlling the shape and trajectory of the fireball he had created he would attempt to do what he had done in his previous attempt but would find it to be hand since he was not as well versed with the Katon element as he was with the Raiton one and he had not mastered the jutsus just yes so the end result would be of his fireball coming down and crashing down into the water that was infront of him. >Infuriating.< he told himself as he broke the handseal he was holding >Tch. I shall continue training at a later time.<* - Thu Nov 19 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Haku(Iron Zorro) Arriving at the lake / pond thing that was located within the Village of Kumogakure, he would stare at the water as he brought his right hand up to grab the zipper that held his coat closed >These missions are beyond stupid, god damn it why the hell do these missions exist? Fuck it, it does not even matter. I will just focus on my training and do the missions later.< Molding and kneeding his chakra within his body as he infused it Raiton into it he thought to himself > Enough with Katon. I am more well versed with the Raiton element so it is easier for me to control and I like using it better.<

Taking a couple of steps away from the lake / pond thing as the technique that he was going to be using was going to affect the creatures in the water so he wanted to avoid that as best he could since his eels fed off the fish that lived in the lake / pond thing. Kneeling down placing a kneed on the ground he would begin to kneed and mold his chakra within his body > This was one of the very first techniques I learned and mastered, so it should be easier to use and control than the Katon jutsus I have been using.< Lowering his palms down to touch the ground bellow him he would prepare to use the jutsu once he was ready to release it > Mold your chakra a bit more.< he told himself as he bagn to send it to his palms.

>This technique actually come in very handy when it comes to keeping someone trapped on the ground, but it has a couple of flaws. The one that I could think of from the top of my head is if the enemy gets off the ground then the technique is useless. I need to come up with a technique that covers this particular flaw so that I can be that much more prepared when the situation ever happens.< Sending out his chakra into the ground he would work diligently to weave the chakra that was on the ground to form a spider web that was characteristic of the technique. > Cover as much ground as possible, focus on having the area around you covered to provide as much protection as possible. Don't want to get blinsided while doing this so it will come in handy.<

Sending out the chara in a straight line to all known cardenal rose points he would begin to weave out his electric web. First off he started from the location neares to him making the characteristic look of a spider web connecting it all around him, continueing with this process he would continue to do it every couple of feet since he did not want to make a very tight web because he was not fighting anyone at the moment >The design is so intricate.< he thought to himself as he continue to connect all the points together and continued to do so evey so ofter. Once he was done with a section he would move up to the next one and began working on the next segment. >Make sure that no one is affected by this.< he thought to himself as he looked around the area as he was weaving his web.

Once that he saw that the technique was not going to affect anyone, he would continue on weaving the web until the jutsu had been completed >Hmmm.< he thought to himself as he kept the shape of the jutsu and the jutsu itself going for a while longer before he decided to end it. >I can do better.< he thought to himself as he slowly stodd up and walked back toward the lake / pond thing > I still eed to do those fucking missions, infuriating isn't it? Very infuriating indeed.< Reaching into his coat he would take out a mission scroll and began to read it.* - Thu Nov 19 02:54:30 2015
