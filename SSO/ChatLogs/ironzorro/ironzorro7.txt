<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: But...If she pushes me away because of a choice like this...then she doesn't like me. - Wed Sep 23 16:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) got off the bed and began walking toward Misa and placed a hand on her cheek "Just know that if you go through with this I will use you when I want." she would say in a sadistic tone of voice and had the facial expression that would go along with the voice then she would lick her lips with her snake like tongue as she stared at Misa with her blue gaze. It would be more than obvious that Hanabi had a few screws loose in her head.* - Wed Sep 23 16:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Very well. - Wed Sep 23 16:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) took a step back and took of her poncho and let it drop to the floor "Lay down." she told her as she motioned toward the bed that Misa had slept in yesterday "Lay down and open your mouth." she told her with a sadistic voice as she began to unzip her cape "You must injest a fluid, that will begin the transformation." she informs her as she begins to take off her cape and let it drop to the floor. Being topless now she kept her blue gaze trained upon Misa as she waited for her to do what she had been told to do.* - Wed Sep 23 16:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) walked over to the bed and got on it then she would climb ontop of Misa sitting on her stomatch then would lean in foward. She would look at her Misa who was slowly opening her mouth and licked her lips with her snake like tongue "Do not close your mouth~" she told her as she opened her own mouth and began to compress her stomatch as fluid began to assend her intestinal track. Slowly a white liquid began to flow down her mouth in small strands that would increase as more and more fluid came out of her mouth with each contraction of her stomatch, the fluid would be aiming to land inside of Misa's opened mouth just like she had done with Hideki weeks prior to this. Of course there were other ways of making her injest the fluid but by far this was her favorite one.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would stop comressing her stomatch once she felt that Misa had injested enough fluid then would close her mouth letting some of the fluid run down her chin. "You will feel sick for the next couple of days." she told her as she leaned in closer to Misa's face "Your very core will be changing, expect a lot of vomiting for the next couple of days as well, I will give you another dose when you need it." with that she would lean in to kiss Misa then proceeded to get off her and walked over to where he cape and poncho were "Do not tell Mariana about this, if she asks then just say you are sick or something."* - Wed Sep 23 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I'll be going out now so you feel free to stay here if you want, I don't really ahve anything of value so yeah. - Wed Sep 23 17:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) raised a brow with intrigue "She is dead~?" she would ask with a sadistic tone of voice "Excellent~" she would say as she motioned for Misa to step foward point to the ground next to her as she stared the the hulking male who had ceased doing push ups "This is Misa." she said introducing her.* - Wed Sep 23 19:41:39 2015
