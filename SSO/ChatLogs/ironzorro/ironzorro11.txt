<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Do you know the strength of Sunagakure? - Sun Sep 27 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: At the moment, no. The shinobi from there were very vague. - Sun Sep 27 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Do you know if they have anyone that can be of trouble? - Sun Sep 27 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Or note worthy? - Sun Sep 27 05:35:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Is he powerful? - Sun Sep 27 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Apparently. - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I would like to show you something. - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: The problem is. - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hm? - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: That if that Edge person comes out I will be in trouble. - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: So I would need you to protect me. - Sun Sep 27 05:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Sure. - Sun Sep 27 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) began walking toward the nearest exit of the village "What I will show you I have not shown anyone and I would appriciate it if you protected me if things go south."* - Sun Sep 27 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I can only wonder what you're going to show me... - Sun Sep 27 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) arrived at Sunagakure and stayed a distance away from the gates since they most likely had soldiers on the walls patrolling them. She would look at Niza and took in a deep breath "Please protect me, you may not like what you are about to see but this will greatly benefit Kumogakure."* - Sun Sep 27 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) nodded once then opened her mouth. Once this was done a snake would appear slithering out of it then another and another then suddenly more and more snakes would begin to emerge from within her. She would quickly drop to her knees as this was a process that greatly exhausted due to the large amount of chakra she was using and the fact that she had snakes comming out of her mouth. Leaning foward to support herself with her arms as well she would continued spewing out more and more snakes looking like a river of snakes. On the ground infront of them the snakes would quickly make their way toward the gates gaining more and more ground as they went since the snakes countinued on pouring out of her mouth. Her facial expression at first would  have been that of a twisted person that was enjoying her actions but that quickly changed as she began to consume more and more of her chakra causing her to gain a distressed look on her face but she would not stop what she had started.

Once everything was said and done a total of Five-thousands snakes would be slithering toward Sunagakure leaving her in a very weak state. Weakly turning her head to look at Niza she would attempt to stand up but her body would not comply with the action as she had just spend too much chakra so it would result in her toppling over "I will use this to protect my snakes." she would tell Niza as she weakly extended her arm to point to the scene, she would have also said that with pauses between words and many pants "I will use this to protect the village as well." she told him in the same fashion that she had said her previous statement." Turning her head to look at the sea of snakes that was making its way toward the wall she would slowly attempt to stand up.* - Sun Sep 27 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would have been caught by Niza so that she wouldn't hit the ground which was thoughtful of him considering she had just gotten a new outfit but more to the point she would look on as the snakes would begin to slither up the walls and entering the village if the path was not blocked by anything. Still feeling exhaused to she have trouble regulating her breathing due to the fact that she had spent almost all of her chakra "This is the pinicle of my training." she told him "With these snakes I will protect those who are important to me, I will protect the homes where those people live. With these snakes I will keep them save." This of course would have been said in a very long and drawn out process due to her exhaustion, panting and trying to regulate her breathing.

The snakes would begin attacking anyone on sight so anybody that was on the wall would have been affected by this as they were either getting bitten or stabbed with blades that where hidden within the snakes. Given the sheer amount of snakes that were poured out of her body resistance would have been futile as it did not matter if the people guarding the gate if any would to begin defensive maneuvers as they would be outnumbered by the snakes. If any of the snakes would have made it past the walls and into the village then even more tragedy would happen to the unsuspecting villagers.* - Sun Sep 27 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) she would also begin to meditate as best she could to regain some lost chakra and rest as much as she could.
* - Sun Sep 27 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) looked on as her snakes were racking up the body count and ventured into the village. She would turn her head and looked at Niza after hearing his words, if it had been up to her she would not have been bothered by the fact that people were most likely dying (we can't know cuz zeno hasnt done the damage calculations) but since Niza had asked she would bring her hands up to execute the Tiger handseal and desummoned the snakes having each and every one of them to go up in a puff of white smoke. "I think it is best we leave." she commented with a more normal voice since she had been resting as this was going on.* - Sun Sep 27 06:24:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) wasnt obviously going to just stand there as she watched him enter the courtyard as she had met him once before and he had tried to do something against her. She would keep her gazed trained on him and when he went for his scythes she would simply open her mouth and out came crawling out a sea of snakes that would form a wall infront of her blocking his attack. Under normal circumstances the attack would have landed but since the technique only required for her mouth to be opened she would have no trouble at all intercepting the attack that Erebus was attempting to execute. As more and more snakes came out of her mouth the wall got bigger and bigger as the snakes would open their mouth and bring forth Kusanagi like blades all aimed at Erebus who had made a charge at her.

More and more snakes continued to come out of her mouth and quickly began over run him as the snakes numbered in the thousands so all he could really do was take it. The snakes would attack indiscriminately at all his body Eye, arms, chest, head, mouth, legs, feet, in short E V E R Y S I N G L E inch of his body would receive a poisonous bite or a sword stab that would come from the mouth of the snakes. All in all five-thousand snakes would have crawlled out of her mouth and would all be just fucking Erebus up since they greatly outnumbered him and there was nothing he could have really done about it considering the fact that A. She only needed to open her mouth and B. he was making his way toward her.* - Sun Sep 27 19:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) continued to have more and more snakes pour out of her mouth when she suddenly he switched his attack to be aimed at her mouth. As more and more snakes poured out of it they would go up against the balde but could not stop it as he had more strenght than them the blade would push through but it would not find its intended target as it would be veered of course which would end up stabbing her cheek which would lead to him breaking through the teeth and into the bone which would work in her favor as her mouth would have been widened allowing more snakes to pour out out of her mouth. Feeling the pain she would wince in pain as she would move back using using the thrusting momentum from stab she had received and used her speed to her advantage as she knew that no one would be able to catch her once she ran. Quickly moving back she would dash diagonally to the right and would move foward aiming to exit the grounds where she was located with her true goal exiting the village.

The snakes would continued to pour out and would slither onto the weapon and aimed their blades at his softs spots stabbing into his eyes and penetrating them untill they hit the cranium causing extreme pain and blindness, snakes would crawl into his shoulders and stick their blades down his ears causing damage as they enetered the auditory cavity causing him to go deaf. The snakes on the ground would attack indiscriminetly as they were not being dealt with so more soft spots would be targeted but it did not seem to really matter as he seemed to be tanking but none the less damage would be dealth to him.* - Sun Sep 27 20:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) His reflexes were quick yes, but the snakes would have already gotten on him before he released the scythe causing him to take damage as the snakes wore exploading out of her mouth causing him to take damage to the metioned softs spots in the previous RP so Eyes and ears would be pierced and bit by the snakes. As for the second scythe it would be met by falling snakes that just like the attack on her mouth would have been veered of course slightly either to the left of right of her body still within the torso region.

As for him running away he would have been met by the snakes on the ground that were already there stabbing and biting at him so his movement would have been limited as his soft spots would have been attacked. Now what does this mean, snakes would have slithered up his legs and began bitting at his legs, thighs, dick, testitcles, anus, gluteus and feet. These would all be being stabbed at my sword and being bitten at by poisonous bites.

As for Hanabi she would drop to her knees with a scythe on her stomatch and a  scythe on her jaw with blood pouring out of both cuts which added in with the inmence amount of chakra she had used up would make her drop to her knees and topple over on the ground as her snakes continued to come out of her mouth as she was still not quite dead yet as she still needed to be finished off. She would stare at scene before her as her vision quickly began to face in and out eventually reducing the amount of snakes that were pouring out of her mouth began to decrease untill it had ceased as the damage done to her body and the amount of chakra spent were too great for her body to handle. She lied there dead in a pool of blood that expanded quickly as more and more blood would flow from her wounds.* - Sun Sep 27 21:18:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) got up and stood by the door.* - Tue Sep 29 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) was leaning against the wall minding his own business in the boring village of Kumogakure when he heard someone approaching his general location so he turned his face to see who it was as he had hoped it was the girl he had been playing dice with yesterday but nope, all he would see was Asteroth staring at him >Tch.< he thought to himself as he lifted up a hand to offer a small wave "Well, if it isn't miss prissy pants herself." Yes that was the greeting he gave her as he stared at her "What brings your prude ass to this fine and boring village?"* - Tue Sep 29 15:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) pushed off the wall and rested his hands on the hits of his blades smirking under his face mask as he walked toward her "What I lack in intellectual capacity I more than make up for it with these." he would move his eyes down as if pointing to his blades then would focuse her gaze upon her once again. "I am here to do whatever my lord allows me to do you see but I chose the wrong village as nothing ever happens here so I am limited as to what I can do but more to the point why are -you- here, I was sort of enjoying my time in this boring village but now I might have to reconsider things."

Turning around to walk toward the wall he was leaning in he would glance back "Oh yeah, there is a body that has recently been laid here so you might want to become the graverobber you are and get that fine ass of yours searching for said body." He would look foward and walked toward the spot he was just in and leaned against the wall "Chop chop graverobber."* - Tue Sep 29 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: This idiot. .  - Tue Sep 29 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) allowed himself to be draged off by Asteroth as he wanted to rather enjoy this moment since it was one of the few moments of social interaction that he had had within the village. >Too easy.< he thought to himself as she dragged him off and pushed him against the wall of an unoccupied home, it was clear that he had a smirk on his face as all of this was going on "Ohhh what is wrong? Did miss prissy pants get offended my the words of an 'intellectually' inferior being? You know if you weren't so damn fine I would have done something to stop you from touching me but since I am rather enjoying this I will allow it to go on for a bit longer you filthy graverobber."

He would then begin to laugh "Oh Lord Lucifer I will enjoy this and I hope you are enjoying it as much as I am." Bringing one of his hands up he would grab the arm that was pressumably holding him against the wall and would begin to squeeze it "You may not be too impressed with my blades as they are sheeth but make no mistake graverobber that once they are out I can inflict all types of pain on you so be thank full that I do not carve you up."* - Tue Sep 29 15:54:01 2015
