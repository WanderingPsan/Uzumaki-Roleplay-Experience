<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) got up and walked over to Misa and looked at her "How are you feeling?"* - Fri Sep 25 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) kneeled and caresed her head "There there it will all go away soon~" she teased at her "On a scale of one to ten how bad is the pain?"* - Fri Sep 25 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) placed a finger over her opened mouth "Given the circumstances I wont be doing it that way Misa. Strip."* - Fri Sep 25 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) crossed her arms unfront of her as she licked her lips with her snake like tongue "Hmmmm~" she would hum to herself rather pleased with what she was seeing. She would glance over at Hideki and motioned for him to get closer then looked at Misa again "All of it." she said in a lustious and sadistic tone as she was intending on inserting the fluid into her body by her least favorite form of doing it.* - Fri Sep 25 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . - Fri Sep 25 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) walked foward and extended out a hand to feel Misa's cheek "Very nice~" Wiping away her tears she used that same hand to move her head to the side exposing her neck "Stay like that." she instructed as she retracted her hand to remove her poncho that fell to the ground then unziped her cape and let that fall as well. Undergoing her transformation she would open her mouth and brought foward two father large snake fangs that were hidden within her mouth and would lean foward to bite her neck and injected the fluid. Pulling her head back she grabed her left arm and bit down on her form arm then repeated the same process for the right one. Each of the bites would hurt since she was inserting a foreign object into her body so there was no escaping pain either way she would do it.

Dropping to her knees she would disregard the fact that Misa's vagina would be near her face and spread her legs a bit as she bit both of her inner tighs and injected fluid into them then moved up to bit each side of her waist. Each of the bites would be several seconds long to injest the right amount of fluid into her body. When the series of bites was done she would turn around and walked toward her clothing as she reverted back to her human form and placed her cape on and zipped it up then grabed her poncho and placed it on as well "Get dressed. In a couple of days time (1 ooc day) you will be feeling like nothing ever happend." Her tone of voice would have been serious as she had gotten down to business just like with Hideki she pushed aside her usual perverted and twisted personality and replaced it with a rather serious one "Your very core will be changing pretty soon you will get your fangs, your skin will become scaily and your eyes might become slitted."* - Fri Sep 25 05:36:12 2015
