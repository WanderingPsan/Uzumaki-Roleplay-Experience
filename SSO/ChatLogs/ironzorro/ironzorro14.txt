<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) thinks: I know what I must do. - Sun Oct 18 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) entered the place and whistled "A fine place you have here." he would tell her as he walked up to the kitchen after staring at the statue. Once inside the kitchen he would look at her figure up and down  and placed his hands on his katanas "What pizza topings do you have?" he would ask her to make conversation as he got a bit closer to her "How much will it cost me?"* - Sun Oct 18 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) would look down at his hands "Oh sorry." he would tell her as he did not notice the action since he was so used to doing it "Habit." he told her as he his hands from the katanas and brought them to the right o unhinge his off hand katana from his belt "Where should I place them." he asked her casually as he took a step closer to her "It is your house after all, I would not want to place something where it doesn't belong."* - Sun Oct 18 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) nodded and pivoted a bit as he brought out his hand with the katana out then pivoted back again and swung his katana over to hit Zenaki on the deck, nothing lethal of course. He would hope that this action would either weaken her or would knock her out long enough for him to have his fun with her. Assuming that the hit had brought her to a weakened state he would quickly follow up with another hit only this time to her side "Oh Lord I knew that you would look out for me." he commented as he dropped his katana and aimed get his hands on Zenaki who was previously making the pizza.* - Sun Oct 18 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) brought his right hand up to grab and pull on her hair to keep her head in place and with his left hand he would deliver a slap to her across the face "My my you are beautiful." he commented as he slapped her again then pushed her to the ground "You see this will be like a tooth ache. It is going to hurt but you are not going to want me to pull it out." With that being said he would turn her around and used his remained katana to cut off her clothes being careful enough to not cut into her skin. It is worth mentioning that he is unaware of anyone else in the house.* - Sun Oct 18 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) everything was going fine and dandy up untill he heard someone talking behind him which caused him to freeze up "....." >Shit.< he thought to himself as he glaced down at his katana which was in his right hand >Fuck it.< he thought to himself as he quickly reached for the katana that was on the floor and pulled it out of its sheeth then went for Zenaki. He would point a katana at her as he moved to get behind her then once that happened he would use the same hand to pull her hair up so that she could stand. "Don't you fucking move." he would tell Beth as he placed his Katanas  near Zenaki's neck crossing them infront of it "One wrong move and she dies which would be a shame because I really wanted to fuck her and I am not about to become a necrophiliac." With Zenaki naked now he would press his body against her naked body and began groping her with his hips "You are a fine doll." he told Zenaki as he looked at Beth getting ready to slice at her throat if Beth dared to do anything.* - Sun Oct 18 01:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) continued to hold the katanas against her neck as he continued to grope on her "Hmm yeah I do not think so." he told the person who was holding up a handseal "How about this. What if we both get to enjoy her? You seem like a reasonable man. I don't mind sharing her." He would then proceed to sniff her hair as he continued to look at Beth "What do you say? I mean look at this beauty. If it werent because I have these Katanas to her neck I would be grabbing her tits like if there was no tomorrow. Nah I would actually be fucking her brains out but things dont aways work out as planned you know? So what do you say? Want to share her?"* - Sun Oct 18 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) raised a brow "Hmmm? It seems that you are a watcher." he commented as she adjusted his grips on the katanas which were still against her chest "Drop the seal and I will let you watch and join in, sound like a deal?"* - Sun Oct 18 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) says: Well you see. - Sun Oct 18 02:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) says: It is like asking you to lower the handseal and break your hands. - Sun Oct 18 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Fine. - Sun Oct 18 02:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) says: And wont use them. - Sun Oct 18 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) brings his katanas down and brings her knee up to make contact with Zenakis knees so that she could drop to her knees then sheeths his katanas. Once that was done he would use his right hand up to grab her by the hair and turned her around as his other hand went up to his pants and undid his zipper and reached for his errect penis. It would be six and a half inches fully errect with the foreskin covering the head "You heard him bitch. Open wide and get sucking." he would tell her and he pulled her head toward his dick poking at her mouth with it "Don't you fucking dare use your teeth because I will fucking cut you head off. Be a good girl now and get sucking yes?"* - Sun Oct 18 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) would have began getting his dick sucked by Zenaki when he felf a very sharp pain that shook him to his core as her nails dug into his testicles "Fuck! Ahh!" he would scream in pain as he brought his free hand up to being hitting Zenaki on the side of the head "You bitch!" he would continue to cry out as he was in intense pain due to a very sensitive area. The hits would have started out strong at first but would begin to weaken as well he was taking damage in a sensitive part even though she was grabing at his testicles through his clothing which did not diminish the pain. Slowly but surely he would stop hitting her as well he was weakened by this since no man should ever go through what he was going through now.....all he wanted was a blowjob but nope.* - Sun Oct 18 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) was at the mercy of Zenaki and Beth since one was gripping her testicles and the other had just delivered a punch to the nose which caused him to being bleeding >Fuck.< he thought to himself as he did not know what to do to get out of the situation.* - Sun Oct 18 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) would have dropped to his knees holding his balls as they had been injured >This is where I die.< he thought to himself as he just awaited whatever was going to happen to him.* - Sun Oct 18 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) would have proceeded to get pounded down untill he was KO'd
* - Sun Oct 18 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) was ragdolled to a basement and strapped to a chair with skipes on the straps causing his hands and feet to bleed from said spikes. He would remain KO'd for the time being.* - Sun Oct 18 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: 3 - Sun Oct 18 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) was still KO'd and OH GOD YOU MONSTERS.* - Sun Oct 18 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) would have slowly woken up by the pain he felt all over his body. Opening his eyes slowly he could see a greelight infront of them but he would notice that one of his eyes would only open a bit due to the beating that Beth had given him >Fuck this hurts alot.< he thought to himself a shse tried to move but would only feel pain as the spikes that were piercing his skin were felt even more "Fuck!" she screamed as he realized that he had been captured >What the fuck are they going to do to me?< he asked himself as he looked around the basement. Feeling the shoulder massage he would glance his head back at the naked Zenaki giving her a glare if she could distinguish it due to the injuries on his face >What the fuck does that mean? Make me feel good? What? Not like this in a fucking basement strapped to a fucking chair.<

Knowing that struggling would only cause him pain he turned his gaze to look at Beth who was looking for something >Tch it is funny how things work out in the end.< he said to himself as he sat there in pain not being able to move his hands and legs >I should have stayed in Amegakure with Asteroth...fuck fuck fuck fuck and triple fuck.<* - Sun Oct 18 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) felt his dick get grabed and looked at Beth who had a bone in her hand "Don't you fucking dare." he told her as he struggled within the chair not caring that the spikes were digging into his flesh "Dont you fucking dare!" he would scream out as the bone was forcefully inserted into his penis causing him to scream in agony. Shaking violently he would be death glaring Beth as the bone was being inserted causing him a great deal of pain "Ahhhh!" he screamed as she struggled in the chair causing more blood to spill thanks to the spikes that were in the straps "I'll kill you both! I fucking kill you both!" he continued screaming in agony.* - Sun Oct 18 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) was getting the wombo combo done to him as Zenaki pressed her boobs against the back of his head then proceeded to take a bite out of his neck which caused him to arch his head backwards in an attempt to headbutt her but it was useless as he had to deal with the fact that he had a bone in his penis now. Looking back toward Beth he would see that he was proceeding to stroke it which caused him pain due to the bone being there "Let me go and I will fucking show you! Who the fuck do you think you are! I will kill you both!" he continued to shout then screamed in pain as Beth squeezed his penis causing him even more pain "Fuck! Please! Stop! Fuck!"

Yep he had gone from the macho phase to the beging phase just like that with the addition of more pain being inflicted to his penis "Stop..please." he would continue to beg as he felt blood slide down his neck wound "Not like this." he said "Not like this, anything but this! You monsters!"* - Sun Oct 18 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) was relieved that the bone was out of his penis but that still did not stop the pain, and what was even worse was that now he had a gash on his chest and stomatch due to the bone cutting into his skin ripping his vest apart "Stop! Please stop! Why are you doing this! Stop! I am begging you! Stop!" His head would slowly begin to drop and go around in circles as he was getting dizzy due ot the blood loss "P-Please....Stop.." he would say with a fainf and weak voice "Stop..this."* - Sun Oct 18 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) would feel less pain because of the healing being done but he would still feel a lot of it >Fuck.< she said to himself as he struggled to keep his head up because he still felt dizzy >I should have kept a katana out.< he continue on thinking to himself as he stared at Zenaki and Beth who were both bluring in and out of his vision "W-Why." he said  as Zenaki was healing him "N-Not..like this."* - Sun Oct 18 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) was left there to KO in a very very bad place as you could only see this type of things in a horror movie.* - Sun Oct 18 05:26:24 2015

His body would want to begin shaking but due to the seal that was placed on him he was unable to do so, so he would begin to breathe rapidly as the fluid worked its way through his system causing him great pain as it did. Normally he woud have been screaming his lungs out but given the fact that he had been in this darkbasement for weeks now with his hands and feet strapped into a chair with spikes on said straps he was unable to move or do anything as his mind and body had been broken and now he had some sort of strange DNA running through his body slowly and painfully killing all of his cells as it traveled through his system.* - Sun Oct 25 20:04:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Haku(Iron Zorro) arrived at the doc that was in Kumogakure and looked all around him taking in the scene before him. Looking to the left there was water, looking to the right there was also water, it would have normally been a boring sight but there was something soothing about it at least to him. Using one of his nails to draw blood from his thumb he would weave five handseals and slammed his palm on the water causing a cloud of white smoke to appear from the seal he had created. Looking down at the smoke and seeing it cleared he would see his eel summon for a quick instant then would unsummon it as the water smelled salty. Straightening his back he would return to glance around the area. >Empty.< he thought to himself as she brought his hand up to his high chollar and held the zipper.

>This place is empty, there is no one around. The amount of fresh water here is also questionable with the only source of it being a small pond up north.< Bringing his hand down and glancing back toward ther north and remained staring at that general direction for a while >What is my purpose here? Why am I here?< he asked himself as he returned to glace back at the water >There is only hardship in this world. The joy and glee are all gone, there is nothing left to live for.< Turning around he would begin walking back toward the center of the village since he had nothing better to do >Might as well go to that pond, my eels will be able to enjoy themselves there.< It was clear that he only cared for his eels at the moment considering the circumstances that were personal to him.* - Sat Nov 14 03:26:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Hand to hand combat then? - Sun Nov 15 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haku(Iron Zorro) says: .... - Sun Nov 15 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haku(Iron Zorro) says: Indeed. - Sun Nov 15 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Haku(Iron Zorro) watched as Hachirou approached and smirked as he did >Fool.< he thought to himself as his left cheek tried to compensate for the lack of skin that was there leaving the smirk to turn more into a grin since he did not have skin covering that side of his mouth. Shifting his body to side step the first punch he threw at his ribs he would undergo a quick transformation as the skin along his spine began to darken and stretched out to his neck, through his arms onto his hands and onto his legs as his teeth would become sharpened fangs. Most of this action was hidden due to the fact that most of his body was covered so the only noticeable thing that Hachirou would be able to see were his teeth becoming fangs which would be very obvious because he lacked skin on the left side of his mouth. 

Bringing his right hand down to deflect the punch that was intended to strike his stomach he would send an electrical current into Hachirous body shocking him because of this action. Following up the delection he would attempt the land a left handed punch on his shoulder, assuming contact would have been made, another electrical current would have been sent into the males body causing him to feel pain. Of course the amount and intensity of electricity was brought down to the minimum since he did not want to cause any long lasting injuries on his opponent.* - Sun Nov 15 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Haku(Iron Zorro) saw this and once again smirked and turned that smirk into a grin >Fool.< he thought to himself once again as he brought his hands up aiming his palms toward Hachirou who was up in the air and focused chakra onto his palms. Kneeding and molding his chakra on his palms a ball of lightning would form infront of them >So much for hand to hand combat.< he told himself as he shot the lightning ball toward the males hand that had the balde in it. Now under normal circumstances the lightning ball would have been relatively easy to dodge but if Hachirou would have noticed, there was something different about the lightning ball as it seemed to be clocking in on that hand with the zanbatou.

Assuming that the blade made contact with the hand he would have hoped that the blade would have been dropped due to the electricity that would have naturally traveled through the males body. Assuming success he would quickly dash forward with impressive speed to catch the balde holding it with one hand that was brought up uinfront of him >Not as heavy as I thought it would be.< he said to himself assuming success with his previous action.* - Sun Nov 15 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Haku(Iron Zorro) saw how Hachirou caught the blade with his other hand as his decent seemed to be faster but he could have just been seeing things since he was more of less done with the spar considering that his body could not take more of this. Stopping in his tracks and jumping backwards several times he would quickly drop to his knees as he began to pant heavily and his transformation wore off >Fuck.< he thought to himself as he panted heavily and severely >I would have thought I would have been able to hold this form for much longer.< Looking up at Hachirou it was pretty obvious that he could not keep fighting much longer "D-Damn." he said between pants and pauses* - Sun Nov 15 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Haku(Iron Zorro) leaned back to sit down as he still needed some air in him "Y-Yeah." he said between pants and pauses again "I can't go any longer." he said once again like he had done so the previous times* - Sun Nov 15 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Haku(Iron Zorro) Arrived at an isolated part of Kumogakure and looked around to make sure that no one was near him, once he made sure of that he would bring his right hand up to his chollar and grabed the zipper that kept it together and slowly pulled it down.Taking in a breath of air he would slowly bring his right hand down to his chest as he brought his left hand up and performed four handseals Dog ---> Dragon ---> Rat ---> Ram as he kneeded and molded chakra inside of his body. Bringing his palms down to the ground he would release the chakra he had molded and kneeded within his body and spread it through the ground in a web like pattern.

>Keep it small.< he thought to himself as the chakra traveled through the ground in all general directions and began connecting with each other in a circle around him >More.< he told himself as he extended his chakra outward in all general directions again and connected the chakra to each other. When everything was said and done he would bring the chakra up to the surface having it show in a spider web like pattern. >Not good enough.< he thought to himself as she stared around at the area around him while keeping his hands on the ground >It needs to be bigger.< he thought to himself as he brought his hands up from the floor bellow him.

Regaining his composture he would take in a deep breath and brought his hands up to his chest again and held them together only keeping them a couple of inches apart >Lets try this now.< he thought to himself as he focused chakra onto the palms of his hands >Use raiton into your chakra to make a ball, should not be too hard.< Doing what he thought he would slowly start to build up chakra on his palms and slowly began to mold it into a ball. He was by no means an expert with the technique but he was working on it so the rate at which the ball formed was slow to say the least.

After several moments of sending and molding his raiton infused chakra into his palms a small orb would form and crackle as more and more raiton infused chakra was poured into the jutsu >More.< he told himself as the orb of raiton infused chakra was slowly growing bigger and bigger by the second, of course to a certain degree as he was well versed with the Raiton element but he was not a master of raiton jutsu usage >More.< he demanded of himself as the ball seemed to stop growing at about the size of a softball ball >Tch, pityful.< he commented displeased with what was happening before his eyes >You are better than this.< he scowlded himself as he extended his hands forward with the lightningball still between them and looked forward trying to focus on a potential target.

Setting his sights on a street post that was near by, he would shoot the lightning ball at it and had it impact the wooden post. The would would burn a bit and spark due to the technique but that is all that would of happened >Tch.< he thought to himself displeased with what had happened before his eyes >Is this all you can do?< he asked himself almost as if mocking himself >You have got to be shitting me, mother and father died for nothing if you could not do anything better than this.< Shaking his head he would straighten up his pose and brought his right hand up to zip up his chollar so that it would hide hi face >You will do better than this.< he told himself as he turned around to walk back toward the lake that existed within the village.* - Sun Nov 15 04:48:51 2015
