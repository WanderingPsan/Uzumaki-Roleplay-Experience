<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) stood there looking at the black haired male and watched as he reached for the giant Shuriken on his back and little did Ryota know but the chakra he placed on the shuriken was being sensed by his own sensing capabilities >What is he doing?< he thought to himself as he sprung into action. Running toward the Shuriken and toward Ryota he would extend out his right hand with his fingers pressed against each other and focused chakra on them and on the fingers of his left hand. Sliding under the incoming Shuriken there was nothing he could do about the chakra that was coating it but he could do something about the male that threw said shuriken.

While sliding he would have snapped his fingers causing the chakra to ignite and for a fireball infront of his finger that was then shot out toward the males chest >Lets see you react to this.< he told himself in confidence as he brought his left hand up to repeat the same process that he had done with his right hand. Snapping his fingers he created another fireball that was shot toward Ryouta in hopes on doing some damage to him and stop the usage of chakra that was on the weapon. This being said he divided his attention between Ryouta and the blade that was passing over him.* - Thu Nov 26 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) watched as his fireballs missed and did not really feel anything as he used that jutsu as a distraction, that being said he would stand up and turn to run toward Ryouta keeping in mind that the shuriken was being controled not by the chakra that he sensed on it >Clever.< he told himself as he entered his lycanthropic state allowing him to move faster. Running at full speed toward Ryouta he would have sent a kick toward the males face with intentions of reducing his dodging margin as he then sent out another swift kick toward the males stomach with intentions of winding him. As for the kunai he hoped to outrun the thing but he kept it on the back of his mind as he was not about to get impaled by the gaint weapon.* - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) watched him dash backwards as he was executing the necesarry handseals for the technique he was going to use and decided to do the same thing himself as he wanted to change things up a bit. >Still engaging in ranged combat.< he said to himself as he executed four handseals Boar ---> Ram ---> Snake ---> Horse ---> Dragon which caused lightning to errupt all around him. Controlling that lightning through his chakra control he would send it as a wave that would collide with the incoming Doton wave that Eiyu had done. "Raiton beats Doton." he commented as he waited for the outcome of the clash "Do not rely soly on it Eiyu, switch things up a bit."* - Thu Nov 26 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) sensed his clone as it was underground and smirked a bit as he placed his hands inside his pockets "You see, the Kage bunshin is a good technique but it cuts everything in half." he told him as he began to toward him as he kept his sensing abilities focused on the clone that was traveling underground and on Eiyu who was standing right infront of him "Let us enagage in a more physical spar." he said as he approached Eiyu and once close enough he would send out a kick toward the males knee "Expand your horizons Eiyu." he told him as he followed that kick with another one not really caring if they landed or not "Be random."* - Thu Nov 26 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) ran after him and took his hands out of his pockets to grab him and prevent him from hitting the ground "You have more than that in you." he told him as he did his best to leave him standing up in his own two feet "You did better last spar, I want to see that fire from you again. Even when you knew that things were not going your way you still tried to fight through it." Keeping his sensing on the clone and Eiyu he would back up a few steps to let the male regain his composture "These spars benefit us both, so give it your all."* - Thu Nov 26 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) >I still have yet to do those missions.< he thought to himself as he stood on the shore line looking at the water > My training is progressing just fine, I can feel myself grow stronger with every day that goes by but I am still by no means strong.< Turning around he would walk toward the nearest mountain and leaned against its rocky wall surface >Should I continue with Katon?< he asked himself as he wanted to see if he could find the answer he was looking for > Raiton is something I have some sort of mastery over so it is easier for me to use but if I just focus on that my Katon would be lacking.<

Sighing and shaking his head he knew that he had found an answer >Katon it is.< he thought to himself as he pushed off the rock wall and walked back toward the lake/pond thing and stood at the shore line. Brining his right hand up  to hold the zipper that held his coat closed >Which jutsu shall I use?< he asked himself as he was unsure as to what jutsu to use >Most of these require many handseals so it would take a relative long time to execute but there are some exceptions to this as there is a jutsu in my arsenal that only requires one handseal.<

Taking in deep breaths he would bring up his left hand and let go of his zipper with his right hand to perform the Tiger handseal > Same thing as with the previous Katon jutsu, create a stream of fire and keep the shape of it. This jutsu is supposed to be a lot more potent than the other one so I have some work to do.< Taking in an even greater breath of breath of air, he would start to kneed and mold his chakra within his lungs infusing the air with Katon natured chakra >Control the rate in which you are releasing the air, that way the jutsu can last longer as you will have more air to blow out.< Still kneeding his and molding his chakra he looked at the water infront of him and got ready to execute the jutsu.

Exhaling slowly he would activate and release the jutsu. Holding the Tiger handseal he would release the air and had it ignite thanks to the chakra that had been infused in the air. >Start controlling the shape of the stream. Keep it in a tight formation.< The stream of fire would travel above the water and caused some of it to evaporate because of the heat that the flame was letting off >This is harder than it seems.< he thought to himself as the stream of fire seemed to be getting out of hand due to the lack of control from his part.

Putting the jutsu to an end he would break the Tiger handseal and began to breathe normally >Fuck.< he said to himself as he stared forward at the water >I need to increase my understanding of the element, this cannot keep happening as it is infuriating.< he thought to himself as he walked back toward the rock wall and leaned against it when he got near it >This cannot happen again, it will not happen again.< he thought to himself as he slowly and carefully slid down the wall to enter a seated position so that he could enter a meditative state to regain his chakra back. >One day I will be able to do it, that is what I am training for.<* - Thu Nov 26 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) \\Having kept his sensing abilities focused on both Eiyu and his clone he would have been able to react "Nice strategy." he commented as he dodged the incoming punch from the clone and returned one toward it most likely causing it to dispell but did not dodge the kick as he aimed to grab onto the leg in hopes of putting Eiyu in a tough situation. If successful he would bring up his elbow in an attempt to deliver a blow to the leg that would most likely cause him some pain. If unsuccessful he would have been sent stumbling back because well his body could not endure much physical pain.* - Thu Nov 26 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) >Interesting.< he thought to himself as Eiyu went back as he failed to grab onto his leg >You are learning.< he thought to himself once again as the Kunai traveled toward him >You are engaging in long rang combat again, you were doing good.< Ducking so that the Kunai could pass over him he would bring his right hand up to unzip his coat, once that happened he would dart toward Eiyu as he remained close to the ground and moved in a zig-zagging motion to avoid any more Kunai from being thrown at him "Give it your all Eiyu." he demanded of the male as he brought his right hand up when he was infront of Eiyu and snapped his fingers causing a fire ball to shoot toward Eiyu. * - Thu Nov 26 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) was honestly not expecting that to happen what so ever so he entered in a momentary panic as his mind quickly raced to get the solution for the situation >I will have to use it.< he thought to himself as his body began to enter its lycanthropic state causing the skin along his back to darken and spread out toward his limbs and the rest of his body, also pores could be seen benith his eyes and along his body. Now that he was in his lycanthropic state he would quickly nope out of the incoming fires way and weaved four handseals Dog ---> Dragon ---> Rat ---> Ram and slammed his palms against the ground sending Raiton natured chakra to apear on the ground as a spiderweb that was quickly woven through the ground hoping to shock Eiyu, not to inflict serious damage upon him but to at least make him hurt since he was not in a killing or hurting mood for that matter.* - Thu Nov 26 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) inhaled and exhaled slowly as he walked toward Eiyu "Good job." he told him as he extended his hand out to Eiyu to help him up as he was still in his lycanthropic state "You made me use a jutsu I have only used once before." he commented to him "And you made me panic enough to use it, kuddos."* - Thu Nov 26 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) Leaning against the wall he would look around trying to see if he could spot Hachirou or Eiyu since he had not seen them in a couple of days >Wonder where they went. I have not seen then around in a while, I woncer if they are still alive. I know that Eiyu must be fine since he hols the title of Raikage but as for Hachirou I really do not know. He might be alive, he might be dead.< Shaking he cleared away the thoughts that were currently through his mind and began to think on what jutsus to train >Raiton is my strong suit.< he began >But  working on my katon really helps me progress further with my abilities so, fuck. Decision, decisions.<

>I will alternate jutsus each day from now on. That way I can get the best of both worlds so to speak.< Crouching down he would reach for the zipper that held his coat closed and pulled it down opening it. >I also need to work on bettering my marksmanship skills. That however will be for another time. Beginning to send chakra to the palms of his hands he would begin to kneed and mold the chakra >This jutsu is rather easy to use as it does not require any handselas to make and it is a medium range jutsu so it is nice to have in my arsenal.< Pushing off the wall and standing up he would turn to face the wooden post that he had been using as a target.

Bringing his hands up to his chest he would begin to focus more and chakra onto them as he brought his hands up to his chest and created a small gab between his hands >Keeping the shape of the ball should be easier now that I have progressed with my abilitites.< Molding the chakra that was accumulating on his palms he would send out a bit of chakra so that the ball could begin to take form >Keep a constant eye on the jutsu, do not let it get out of control like the Katon jutsus have.< he told himself as he sent more chakra to his palms.

Separating his palms from each other a bit more he would slowly begin to release chakra so that the ball would start to grow and take from > Controlling it is easy now but do not get cocky as there is still room for error.< he told himself as he began to hear the ball crackle and saw as it began to spark due to the increased amount of Raiton in the jutsu. >I used to hate that sound.< he began >When I was small it was the sound I hated the most.< he finished as he separated his hands from each other more and released even more chakra into the forming ball >Things change.< he said to himself as it implied that he no longer hated the crackling sound.

Bringing his hands apart fully now he would allow the ball of lightning that was growing in the space between his palms to grow to its full size >Keep the in shape do not let it get out of control.< he thought to himself as he had the ball between his palms. FOcusing on keeping the shape of the jutsus going he began to think to himself > I wonder when I will be done with this training?< then readied his body to get ready to shoot off the technique toward the wooden post that he had been using for target practice and launched the ball toward it. After it impacted he zipped his coat back up and went on with his day as he had decided that this was enough training for now.* - Thu Nov 26 23:41:39 2015

Looking around he was happy that no one was around >Damn that Eiyu.< he thought to himself as he began to mold and kneed chakra within his lungs >This used to be my "sanctuary" of sorts for me where I could come and do nothing withount having to interact with people but then came along Eiyu and with that ended my "sanctuary". Now I cannot be alone in peace.< It was very clear that he was very upset about this.

Kneeding and molding his chakra within his lungs he began to regulate his breathing so that he could slowly begin expanding his lungs in the hopes of being able to acumulate more air than the usual amount. > I need to find a new place where my eels and I can be in peace but that cannot happen any more since well thanks to Eiyu this place has become eveyones favorite spot. I really need to find a new one.< Continueing on with his breathing exercise he also continued to kneed and mold his chakra withing his lungs >This technique requires an unsually high amount of chakra and whoever said that was right because it does.<

Executing six handseals Tiger ---> Ram ---> Monkey ---> Boar ---> Horse ---> Tiger as he ontinued to mold and kneed his chakra within his lungs > Just a little more.< he thought to himself as he was doing all of this >Just a couple more days of this training and I feel as if something might happen or I will be able to do more things than usual.< Taking in a deep breath of air he would hold the air within his lungs as he molded and kneeded the chakra for a final time getting ready to execute the jutsu. >Do not take it lightly as this jutsu can really become unstable, considering that I do not master the Katon element like the Raiton element.

Bringing his right hand up to unzip his coat he would use that same hand to form a circle infront of his mouth with his index finger and thumb, he began to blow the air out of his mouth through the circle he had created with his fingers which caused the chara to ignite infront of him. Using his chakra to control the shape of the jutsu he could slowly but surely begin to mold the shape of the justsu into a gaint ball that started off small and began to grow bigger and bigger as the seconds went by >Keep it in control.< he told himself as he watched the jutsu grow and grow.

Building the fire to the shape he wanted which was the circular one he would think to himself >This is really taxing.< he told himself as he felt a chunck of his chakra go missing because of th ejutsu he had created. As the fireball grew to its full size it would begin to evaporate the water bellow due to the heat that was eminating from the jutsu. Lunching the jutsu forward he would send it to impact against the water that was infront of him causing a whole lot of steam to get released into the air >Good enough for now.< he told himself as he went and did  other things* - Fri Nov 27 00:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) didnt actually send out the ball of lightning as he was still building it up between his palms >Eiyu used that jutsu.< he thought to himself as he focused his sensing abilities on the ground bellow him since he more or less had an idea of how the jutsu worked and what it was used for >Got to give him points for diving underground.< he thought to himself as he stood in the exact same spot where he had been standing since the begining of the spar. >What will he do now?< he asked himself as he waited for him to emerge from the ground.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) Arriving at the lake/pond thing and looked at the water ahead of him as he brought his right hand up to unzip his coat open revealing his scared face and kunai belts that hung around his hip as well as the many kunai that it had stored withint its compartments. >I need someone to make me special receptors so that I can conduct my electricity to them when they are not near me.< He thought to himself as he brought his hands up to his chest and separated them a bit as he began to send chakra to his palms. Kneeding and moding his chakra he would continue to stare at the water ahead of him and focused on the task at hand which at this point was routine since he had spent so much time practicing shaping his techniques.

>Using my electricity to my advantage is certainly a trump card of sorts but I must be careful not to reveal it to other people. I have been lucky enough to have only used it infront of Hachirou but he did not notice anything thanks to my outfit covering most of my body.< Smirking a bit he continued to mold and kneed chakra in his palms as he stood there staring at the water >There are so many things I want to do and achieve but I need to train hard and get stronger for that to happen. One day I will do it.< he thought to himself as he continued to kneed and mold his chakra on his palms getting ready to execute the jutsu and continue with his training.

Separating his hands a bit he would send out chakra and formed it into a ball >These new people seem to be troublesome, I do not know if Eiyu shuld have allowed them to stay here.< Molding the small it of chakr into a ball he would have slowly separated his hands more andsent out a bit more chakra causing the ball to grow a tiny bit more >Eiyu seems to be fucking up but that is just my personal opinion that no one really cares for but oh well. Such is life.< Iwill leave this place soon enough.< Manipulating the chakra within the ball he would keep its round shape and would look at it >This is surely easier than the first time I did it.<

Looking up at the water that was infornt of him  and separated his hands a bit more so that the ball could be allowed to grow to a medium size causing it to crackle and spark due to the increased amount of Raiton that was accumulating within the growing ball >What will I do when I leave?< he asked himself as he looked down at the crackling and sparking ball >Where will I go? At least here I have somewhere to stay but out there I would have nothing, not that I mind but it will be a hastle to say the least.< Turning his body to target the wooden post he would bring his hands up a bit more.

Separating his hands a lot more the ball of lightning would grow to its full size causing it to crackle and spark with a greater frequency >I will find out what the future holds for me as time passes.< he told himself as he focused on the wooden post that was directly infront of him but was quite a distance away. >Having stationary targets really does not help me much at all but it is still very good practie non the less.< Shooting the lughtning ball toward the wooden post he wuld watch as the ball crackled and sparked through the air until it impacted its target >Good enough.< he thought to himself as he zipped his coat back up and walked away.* - Mon Nov 30 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(Iron Zorro) Arriving at the training field he decided to mix things up a bit since well staring at the water was getting kind o boring and he did not like the fact that the lake/pong thing was a common chilling spot now, so the training field seemed like the right choice considering that no one really went there for anything. >Suck a waster of space that no one uses.< he told himself finding some sort of satisfaction with the chance of scener >Better get started then.<

Beginning to kneed and mold his chakra he would look around him to make sure that no one was around him to make sure that no one would have been near him because he was anti-social and he did not want anyone else knowing about his abilities or jutsus.< Yesterday was risky, too many people saw me spar Eiyu. If it werent for my discrete transformation they would have all noticd that soething was different about me. I have to be more careful about it nest time.< Continueing to kneed and mold his chakra within his body he wou;d think to himself >The world is becoming increasingly dangerous so accomplishing my training is more important than it was before so I need to finish this so that I can move on to the next training.<

Bringing his hands up to his chest he would get ready to execute a series of handseals as he continued to kneed and mold his chakra within his body >This jutsu became easier to use with the training that I have done in the past couple of months so that is good. It will really come in handy when I need it.< Executing four handseals Dog ---> Dragon ---> Rat ---> Ram he would kneel down to the ground and placed his palms flat against the ground. This was done in preparation for the jutsu he was going to execute >Make sure that there is no one around so that they dont get injured and that they dont see this technique.< he told himself as he got ready to unleash it.

Releasing the chakra he had been molding and kneeding within his body he would have sent it to the ground via his palms and began to control it through his chakra control. >Weave the jutsu as fast as you can, the faster you get this down the better it will be when you use it in a combat situation.< Weaving the intricate pattern that was the spider web, he focused on first laying down the basic shape of the spider web as it was a complex shape that would have given anyone trouble if they were not as familiar with the Raiton element.

With the basic shape laid out in a certain radious around him, he would reinforce the jutsu with more chakra that would make the jutsu with more chakra that would make the spider web that much more noticeable. >Keep it up, focus on keeping the shape of the jutsu and keep the jutsu in control.< Pouring more and more chakra he would look around and when he was satisfied he would remove his hands from the ground and stand up >Good enough.< he thought to himself as he patter his clothes and began to walk toward the center of the village.* - Mon Nov 30 04:10:01 2015
