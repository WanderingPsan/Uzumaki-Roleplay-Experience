She would close her eyes as she released the nature energy she had stored within her body and opened her eyes, her usual blue eyes would now be yellow and would be slitted much like a snakes eyes. Her skin would begin to change as she began to grow green scales that began to cover every inch of her body from head to toe. Anyone around her should be able to see the scales in her chest just fine as it was bare and exposed.

At the same time feathers began to grow along her back becoming a crest and around her neck giving her a cholared appearance. The feathers would be vivid colors such as red, oranges and green resembling an exotic bird of sorts. Hunching over anyone around would be able to notice two growing protusions forming where her shoulder blades were. Suddenly errupting everyone around would be able to tell that she had now grown wings from her back that had the same vivid colors as he feathers that were on her crested back and neck.* - Mon Sep 14 18:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) previously had stated that her eyes were no longer blue that they were now yellow with black slits.

Tilted her head and flickered her snake like tongue then brought the same finger she had been using to run up and down Hideki's chest and touched his cheek "How about you teach me those~? Think of it as an investment of sorts~"* - Mon Sep 14 21:16:48 2015

She would move her arm to grab the back of Hideki's head predator style as she moved her wing to accompany the motion her arm was making.* - Mon Sep 14 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: That kid always stares at people. - Mon Sep 14 21:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) dead eyes Hideki as her arm was grabed. "Foolish male.~" she said in a sadistic way as a white snake quickly coiled from her back to her arm and wrapped around Hideki's body wrapping itself tightly around his body. Presumably her arm would have been let go of and she would chuckle to her hearts content "You see Dear the way things work with me is that I need to get what I want when I want them, there are no if or buts and there is most certainly no room for what another person wants~" 

She would use her other hand to cares Hideki's cheek and brought out her fangs to their full length having them in plain sight as she opened and closed her mouth. If one would too pay attention they would be able to see strands of saliva and other fluids forming inside her mouth every time she opened her mouth "Also refrain from touching me when I am trying to get something I want yes~"* - Mon Sep 14 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: xD - Mon Sep 14 21:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) felt her body go numb and limp as raiton chakra coursed through her body. The snake that wrapped around his body would go limp as well then go up in a white puff of smoke as she layed on the ground twitching from the jutsu. She would however give a death glare to Hideki as her body was spassing out involuntarily thanks to him "Y-Y-Yo-You..are..d-d-dea..dead." she would struggle to say as she had a hard time breathing and gaining control of her body.* - Mon Sep 14 22:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would attempt to tunr her head away from his hand but thanks to her spassing body she would not be able to as she had no control over her body. The death glare was real.* - Mon Sep 14 22:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Fair is fair, this was all a joke. I hope she realizes that. - Mon Sep 14 22:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Probably not. - Mon Sep 14 22:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) did not react other than spas out thanks to his jutsu although the spasses were with less intensity. After a while she had regained control of her body and slowly started to sit up while still glaring at him "Y-You..will pay dearly for that."* - Mon Sep 14 22:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) slapped the hand away with one of her wings as she slowly began to stand up by her own merit.* - Mon Sep 14 22:21:39 2015
