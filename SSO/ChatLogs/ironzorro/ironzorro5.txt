<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) waited for him to walk past her and used this moment to strike, she would quickly run up behind him and summon two snake out of her back that would restrain him stopping him from doing handseals and restraining movement over all, the snakes would also aim to paralize the head since she did not want to deal with those eyes of his.* - Sat Sep 19 22:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) spat on the ground beside her as her snakes would burn then go up in a puff of white smoke "You do not understand." she said as she met his glare with her own " When I was a kid I had nothing, nothing at all I was abandoned by my parents and left to die in a forest. I suffered starvation beyond what the human body could withstand as I roamed endless and pointlessly through the forrest but one day my luck changed as I stumbled onto a cave. At first I thought it was some runed down building long fogotten by time and I thought to myself 'Well at least if I die I will die where no one can find me.' so I entered the cave seeking to heel over an die. What I found in that cave was something that changed my life and at first I could not believe it myself as I thought that I was hallucinating due to the starvation." she would pause and take in a deep breath.

"Before me layed a giant White snake that was smoking a pipe and hat this funny hat on and I know it might not be something that is believeable but its true . That snakes looked at me and saw me and what he did next changed my life as he took a bite out of me and injected me with the fluid. There was no guarantee I was going to survive given my current state but I did and it is thanks to that that I was able to achieve this form. At the time I believe myself to the the most powerful thing in the universe aside from the old geezer but once I made my way into the real world I realized that I was not even considred strong by any means and I realized that I was not worthy to hold such power. I have been actively seeking someone who is worthy enough to use this power to its full potential and continue on carrying the gift that was planted in me."* - Sat Sep 19 22:19:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) Continued to meet his gaze and since she was still honestly dumb as a jiraffe the mentioning of genjutsu did not really do much to stop her from trying to achieve her objective"Go ahead and place me in a genjutsu see if I care." she replied to him as she went to take of her cape revealing her bare breasts "I need someone like you to carry what has been given to me. Only someone that is strong like you can achieve something with this. Forget your ideals, forget about your body changing no one will control you, you will live a normal life and you do not even have to use the transformation. It can remain dormant within you for years and years to come without you having to worry about it." 

As she was saying that she had began to transform into her lycanthropic state and when she was done she would begin executing two handseals Snake ---> Rat and remained looking at Ushinawa "Accept this gift....please." it was clear that she was ready to fight for what she wanted even though it was already decided that she was going to lose as she was no where near as strong as he was.* - Sat Sep 19 22:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) BOOM! she became a vegetable and began to answer everything that Ushinawa had asked of her.

"I am a snake lycan created by injesting the fluid injected into me by the White Snake Sage."

"You sign a blood contract."

"Find a suitable candidate to pass on this lycanthropy to so that he can continue on the lycanthropy liniage in case I die."* - Sat Sep 19 23:00:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would bring up her thumb to her mouth and used her fang to poke it and once blood had been drawn she would smear it across her forearm and slammed her plam on the ground causing a formula to apear on the ground and in a puff or white smoke a very large acanonda like white snake similar to the ones that she used to restrain people would appear on the ground before them.

"The scroll." she simply said then the snake began to regurgitate a giant contract scroll. Once it was out she would walk toward it and opened the page where her name and several people before her were written down in blood "It is a blood contract." she stated as a way for him to know that he needed to use blood to sign the thing.* - Sat Sep 19 23:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) \\Snake swallowed the scroll and poofed away then she was released from the genjutsu.

Blinking twice she would look around and see that Ushinawa was in a different position than where she had last remembered seeing him. She turned to look at him and did a punching motion toward him expecting for snakes to come out of it but turns out nothing happened >What?< she thought to herself as she stared at him then at his hand >Why didn't anything happened?< she asked herself as she then decided to scrub the idea and used her overwelming speed to close the gap between the two and threw a series of punches toward his stomatch.* - Sun Sep 20 00:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) knew that this was an uphill battle in a muddied terrain so she knew that she was going to end up loosing this but she did not expect it to end that quickly. She would feel as his blade would cut into her scaly skin but luckly for her she had her mucus protecting her from the fiery portion of the attack which would only reduce said fire damage but did not stop the strikes from the blade itself and well she could not dodge as she had the reflexes of a dead cat which really sucked so in the end she would end up dropping to her knees as the pain from the cuts quickly over came her >Fuck this hurts.< she thought to herself as she glared up at Ushinawa.* - Sun Sep 20 00:25:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) watched as Hideki changed into his lycanthropic state and was rather amazed as she slowly began clapping "Very very nice~" she would comment toward him as she would lick her lips with her snake like tongue "Open your mouth~" she would instruct him as she took a step closer to him "I want to see them~" refering to his fangs "It is still early but you have gotten yourself a snake of the pit viper species. Now if you know anything about snakes you would know that there are two things you do not want to see when classifying a snake and they are the words "Pit" and "Viper" attached to them...you have both~" she would tell him with a sadistic voice as she took another step "Let me see them~" she asked again * - Sun Sep 20 21:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) grinned "Ohhhhh~ They are big~" she told him as she brought a hand up to cares his scaly cheek "Very good Hideki~" then she would turn around and take several steps away. Bringing her hand up to get mouth she would bite down into it drawing blood from it then she would smear it on her palm and did five handseals Boar ---> Dog ---> Bird ---> Monkey ---> Ram and slam her plam into the ground causing a formula to appear. 

In a puff of white smoke a white anaconda like snake would appear coiled around Hanabi up to her waist since it was a medium sized snake "You shall now sign a blood contract, all you need to do is write your name in blood and you will be able to summon snakes." she would tap the snake on the head and it would uncoil and slither toward Hideki and began to regurgitate the scroll dislocating its mandible. When the scroll was out she would motion for him to grab it and open the scroll "You will see my name and Ushinawa's name wirtten in there as well as all the people before us who have signed the contract so knock yourself out." * - Sun Sep 20 21:57:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would walk toward the scroll and closed it then tossed it to the ground and the snake would swallow it up and puff away "Because it would not have been fun for anyone~"* - Sun Sep 20 22:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Tch. - Sun Sep 20 22:02:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I will teach you the basic. - Sun Sep 20 22:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) brought her hands up and executed two handseals Snake ---> Rat and did a punching motion toward the ground bellow her with her right hand. Out of her wrist came out six snakes that would land on the ground and begin slithering around "This is a simple technique that you should have no problem mastering. Place enough effort into and you should be able to master it along with you summoning technique at the moment both you and Ushinawa should be able to summon baby sized snakes."* - Sun Sep 20 22:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) was impressed "Very good~"* - Sun Sep 20 22:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: These snakes carry poison in them. - Sun Sep 20 22:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And they carry blades. - Sun Sep 20 22:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: So I'm assuming, once I get the technique down, I can inflict the poison and blade damage to them.. - Sun Sep 20 22:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) would motioned with her left hand for her snakes to slither up her body. One snake would slither down her left arm and opened its mouth revealing the hilt of a blade. Reaching for it with her right hand she would extended out infront of her with one hand "Correct. At your current skill level you should be able to summon about three snakes per use but when you master it you get as many as I get."* - Sun Sep 20 22:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) notes that the blade is Kusanagi like in nature* - Sun Sep 20 22:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) glanced over at Ushinawa with a grin on her face then would look at Hideki "At moment focus on mastering this and the summoning jutsu."* - Sun Sep 20 22:15:40 2015
