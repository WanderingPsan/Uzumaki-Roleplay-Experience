"We are both the same Misa but we are different at the same time. We now have a bond that will only be broken by death, I am a snake and you are a snake we can both do different things thanks to this but that does not change the fact that we are the same."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) watched as all hell broke loose before her and stood there thinking of what to do but once she saw Ushinawa go on attack mode she knew that she had to provide some back up. Speeding off directly infront of where she was she would get in parrallel to misterious figure that had appeared in the village and would keep a close eye on him as she dropped her Poncho on the ground and began to unzip her cape leaving it on for the moment.* - Sat Sep 26 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) watched as the male did a handseal she had never seen before and suddenly mist. Her vision would have become limited to a few feet infront of her and would have actually be at a loss as to what to do for once >What is this?< she thought to herself as this was the first time she had encountered the mist >How do I fight in this?< she would continue to ask herself as she heard the clinking of metal somewhere in the area but could not pin point it as well she had normal human senses. However her luck changed when Ushinawa used the Great Dragon Flame Jutsu that quickly evaporated allowing her to gain vision of the Mamoru and the unknown male.

Taking her cape off she would begin to transform into her lycanthropic state as she would now be topless. Her skin would be covered by green scales that would cover every inch of her body, she would begin to grow feathers along her spine forming a crest and around her neck forming a chollar. Out of her shoulder blades emerged two massive wings that were spread out a couple of feet to each of her sides. Flapping her wings she would send out green scales toward the male that had attacked her fellow shinobi, the scales would be coated with a paralytic that would kick in as soon as the scales managed to penetrate the skin. Of course there were other variables to consider with this as she was facing the males side which reduced his profile by a considerable about so she would have been careful enough to only send a small amount of scales toward the males direction to avoid colateral damage.* - Sat Sep 26 06:28:41 2015
