<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: A bit of both~ - Wed Oct  7 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I've got a fight to win apparently. I'll see you later, Katsune. - Wed Oct  7 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. Good luck. - Wed Oct  7 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) disappears all batman like and shit.* - Wed Oct  7 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You will die! - Wed Oct  7 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) appeared in a bit of a flash. The sand around him dispersing as he suddenly halted his increase in speed. Upon being noticed by Yan he would immediately summon a fair amount of clones, all of which were earthen in form. 

"Well, he gets right to it." he thought to himself. As three clones approached, another three went under ground, and four remained with the  him he'd raise his defenses in the form of a basic stance.

Seeing as the clones couldn't reach him this turn, he'd only edge a bit closer. * - Wed Oct  7 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) raised his eyebrow as the middle clone made good on his chakra spike and unleashed a torrent of mud. It seemed that Yan had quite the chakra pool to simply throw technique after technique out, but Baen already knew that. Deciding to avoid them altogether, he simply took a single step south west whilst weaving a single seal, ram. 

Instantaneously he disappeared, appearing a ways downward, his hands maintaining the seal as he performed it yet again, but this time his target was a bit more...lively as opposed to sand. With his shunshin speed, he would attempt to charge straight into Yan, the original. While he had his clones set up in a rather peculiar fashion, this allowed gaps, gaps which he would capitalize and close the distance. So much so that he would actually tackle the man with strength bolstered by his instantaneous speed. 

If all went well, he would slam him into the mountain face north west of his current position. The wind knocked out of him, not to mention a fair amount of damage should he collide with the face. * - Wed Oct  7 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) thinks: What am I looking at? - Wed Oct  7 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // His momentum was true as he paused for his brief intermission between shunshin, but his sight was equally as impressive. During this brief "pause" he'd take in his surroundings, his eyesight giving him a fair glimpse of the field, including Yan's decent into stone. His teeth clenched in annoyance as his second shunshin moved forth. Seeing as there was no target to make contact with, he'd have to halt his movements a bit early. 

While his momentum was a bit staggering he'd have no choice but to collide with the mud wall, breaking it clean through and with his trajectory altered, he'd more than likely strike one of the clones with the damage meant for the original, turning it to mud once more. 

Sliding against the ground he'd halt his movement by leaping onto the mountain side, chuckling lightly. 

"Oh, this is going to be annoying. Sand guy, take care of the clones if you want to help~"* - Wed Oct  7 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) wasn't stunned what-so-ever, and flipped backward upon the mountain face on some matrix shit, attempting to avoid the rocks. As the clones dispersed simultaneousy, he'd raise his eyebrow and stand sideways upon the mountain. 

"Where'd he go?"* - Wed Oct  7 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Nah, he told me he called em off for the fight.  - Wed Oct  7 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Meh, I didn't think he'd run. - Wed Oct  7 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Hm. - Wed Oct  7 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) decided on doing something a bit devious, and so he henged into Alastor. "Yo, stay here for a bit." * - Wed Oct  7 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Alastor? - Wed Oct  7 06:53:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Alastor(Ama No Murakumo) entered the scened with a bit of a rushed look on his face. "Meh. What happened. You had a fight with that Baen character."* - Wed Oct  7 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Who is alastor... - Wed Oct  7 06:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Is that him? - Wed Oct  7 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Because. . .You asked for seafood! Tch. .  - Wed Oct  7 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: No taking back your order. - Wed Oct  7 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Alastor(Ama No Murakumo) raised his hands in a defensive gesture as he took a few steps north west. "Hey, i'm just looking out for a friend of mine." He'd glance towards Yan and then Jiki, they bore similar gourds so he felt a bit of familiarity with him. 

"All in good fun."* - Wed Oct  7 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Would I be welcomed if i executed the traitor? - Wed Oct  7 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Psychic_Warrior) says: ------Woah, woah, woah! - Wed Oct  7 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Alastor(Ama No Murakumo) noticed Yan's quick handseal movements and raised an eyebrow. He wasn't sure as to what he was doing, but it surely wouldn't benefit him in any way. Alastor quickly dashed forward, making use of his rather impressive speed to escape harms way. 

"What the fuck!" 

Although, If the spears surpassed his movement speed, aswell as his overall reflexive capacity, he would surely be struck. * - Wed Oct  7 07:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Alastor(Ama No Murakumo) narrowed his eyes as Yan leapt backwards, it was clear that he was untrusting of Alastor, not that he didn't have good reason. He raised both his hands and clasped them in a prayer like motion. "Ok, ok, calm down man." he knew he was outclassed.* - Wed Oct  7 07:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm.. - Wed Oct  7 07:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: he* - Wed Oct  7 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Alastor(Ama No Murakumo) was suddenly caught in what appeared to be a genjutsu. While there wasn't much of a "hint" aside from a giant lush tree sprouting out of no where in the middle of a barren desert in which any and all trees were wilted and hollow. Not to mention Yan turning to petals and disappearing from sight. It was safe to say that he was caught in genjutsu. 

"Well, that's unfortunate, just trying to break bread." he thought to himself as he gathered his chakra in a quick and efficient manner, unleashing it swiftly and concisely as to activate the Kai technique. If successful he would break through the genjutsu as his scenery returned to normal. 

"Hey. What the fuck."* - Wed Oct  7 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Im not killing him... im just taking a body part... - Wed Oct  7 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Alastor(Ama No Murakumo) was standing rather still, not really focused on Violet as she began towards him, brandishing her blade as she attempted to cleave off his leg in one fowl swoop. Unfortunately for her, and those viewing, it was about to get weird. As the blow struck him he'd glance over his shoulder, his defenses providing quite the cushion for the blow. In fact, the entirety of his leg would remain intact, only a small portion of his skin would be cut at all, and even that would reveal a layer of bone which wasn't very conductive if at all. 

Deciding to drop the charade he'd drop the henge, revealing himself to be none other than Baen of the fucking Ossa. *Drops mic because what a fucking performance* Looking towards Violet in her eyes he would unleash a rather vicious glare. 

"Girl. You've ruined my plans. You, Violet. Have just given me a reason." However, seeing as he was heavily outnumbered he opted for the more evasive manuever. * - Wed Oct  7 07:49:20 2015
