<br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) was apparently standing in the way all awkward like as Kilm attempted to make his exit. "Well then."* - Mon Aug 31 13:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) was bumped, but not without retaliation. As Klm shot him the "irritated" look, he'd raise his eyebrow and jut his foot out, aiming to trip the man. "Whoops."* - Mon Aug 31 14:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) nods back, dealing out his own fist bump. "Baen of the Ossa. I've yet to acquire a nickname worthy of my talents~"* - Mon Aug 31 18:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) raised both his hands to about chest level before clasping them over one another. Applying a bit of pressure, Baen would begin to crack his knuckles ever so slightly. Glancing towards Ikaro he'd smirk lightly only to look to Tethys and raise a curious eyebrow. "Hmm.."

The Ossa has a fair amount of speed and so the distance shouldn't be a problem, and he was confident in his capacity to face the man in combat, or perhaps that was merely his pride getting the best of him. The man before him, afterall, -is- Tethys of the black blade. 

Bending his knees he'd charge forward, his right fist clenched in preparation for his ensuing initial strike, which would be launched towards the man's torso region, if he was anyhing like his brother over there Baen was sure that he'd either pull some slick shit or merely display his acquatic transformation. * - Mon Aug 31 19:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) //And thus, his punch was matched.  Such a testament to the man's experience, to gauge the strength and speed of a strike mid swing and then produce a counter strike to nullify the original. Baen was impressed. However, that just makes things all the more..difficult. Seeing as his forward approach had begn to fail, he'd opt for a different route. 

Pulling back, Baen would hop into the air whilst raising his right leg upward, in preparation for an axe kick. The buildup would prove to be somewhat time consuming, but nothing more than a few seconds. But perhaps it was a rouse of some sort. Regardless, he'd swing his leg doward and attempt to strike Tethy's upon the head. * - Mon Aug 31 19:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // his foot landed with a thud, only narrowly missing it's intended target by a few inches. As infuriating as it was to miss by such a small margin, he had to compose himself for his opponent wouldn't be so forigiving. Almost on cue, Tethys lunged forward, his foot lurching towards his chin in the hopes of bringing about that "sweet chin music". 

He lacked the capacity to swiftly dodge the strike, nor did he have the means to appropriately block the jounin's strike. So he fell back on more clan related endeavors. The bones throughout his body began to harden almost instantaneously. 

The strike would make contact, but it surely wouldn't be too plesant for either party. Stumbling backward, Baen would rub his chin and chuckle to himself. His opponent was very skilled. It was amazing that he was able to do as much as he did, but even so, he knew that he was holding back and that this could of ended alot sooner. 

"Is that all!"* - Mon Aug 31 19:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // Everything seemed to be going well. He knew he couldn't defeat him in combat but it seemed that at the pace things were moving he'd be able to sponge some combat techniques or just increase his overall ability. Atleast, that's how he thought, until that giant hulking blade that was the jounin's Namesake appeared out of a seal upon his shoulder. 

"So it begins.."

These were the only words that appeared to him as he witness the charge. As imposing as the blade was, he was sure that he could face it in combat...or at least not die from a single stroke, whichever came first. Raising his right hand he'd tense his muscles, seeing as it was the blunt edge of the blade he'd have enough natural resistance to prevent his arm from being sliced clean off, not to mention his bones were hardened considerably. 

The strike would send a sharp pain throughout his left forearm, enough for him to cringe and clench his teeth, but if he could hold the blade at bay for just a few seconds...it would be enough. Raising his right hand he'd aim his fingertips towards the man's thigh's. Within seconds he'd unleash a barrage of digital shrapnel towards the man's upper leg, aiming to do what they did best. * - Mon Aug 31 20:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) narrowed his eyes as the man dodged his attack from so close, almost as if he had an idea as to what he could do? Or maybe he had a sixth sense for such things after spending so much time in the militia. Either way, he had few options at this point. His opponents speed and skill were leagues above his, and he hadn't used a single technique as opposed to Baen who'd used a total of two. 

"Ooof!" 

The wind was knocked out of his chest as the blade struck against his side, sending him sliding amongst the dirt and gravel. Admist his inner debate he'd overlooked the hulking blade, how he allowed himself to do so was beyond him at the moment so he merely accepted it for what it was. Nonetheless he was sure he'd wake up the next morning with a bruise. 

"..Focus..."

He coughed a bit of blood into his hand before standing erect. Using his thumb to wipe the blood from his lips he'd offer a rather intense glare towards (*INSERT COOL ASS PROFILE PICTURE*) His eyes attained a more serious look about them as he began to center himself, allowing his more primal instincts to rise to the forefront. 

"Alright...." Charging forward once again, he'd make use of his speed to close the distance and suddenly raise his arms. Within seconds numerous bones would sprout from his person, all of which were as sharp as spears and threatened to end the life of any who got too close. Leaping into the air and spinning wildly he'd attempt to overwhelm Tethys with his "Dance."* - Mon Aug 31 20:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // He had the momentum, literally. In such a fluid dance there was little room to stop your advance. The spinning and leaping motions themselves were necessary to continue the barrage, otherwise you'd be nothing more than a walking pin cushon. No..this dance was to be celebrated on the field of battle, surrounded by countless fallen enemies, but Baen would settle for taking down a jounin commander. 

At the beginning of the fight it seemed like a far off dream, but after drawing blood he began to think that maybe he could indeed "win". But perhaps that too is merely wishful thinking. 

In spite of his previous attack he'd continue, spinning and jabbing the spears outward aiming to compensate his lack of strength and speed with elasticity and versatility. He aimed specifically from the thighs and up, dipping low to go for the ankles on occasion. How would the jounin react to the continued onslaught.* - Mon Aug 31 20:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // I suppose you could call everything up to this point the calm before the storm. We're not talking Katrina...no we're talking Tethys, and it was all focused towards Baen. Despite his upperhand in the last few exchanges, things quickly took a turn for the worst as the jounin began to unleash his techniques and slip into a more primal state. 

Despite being the worst outcome it would be a learning experience, one that he was sure he'd treasure for a bit. Not being one to backdown at all, he'd continue his charge, swaying from side to side as if he were a tree in an everchanging breeze. 

"C'mon!" 

he'd roar as he leapt forward, rotating at a considerable pace. The ivory spears reaching to clash with the Black Blade. Only to fall short in the strength department. His bid at an exchange failed and he was struck by the wide stroke, sending him flying backwards. 

His bones retracted as he lay sprawled out on the gravel. "Fuck...Fuck."* - Mon Aug 31 20:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) sat upright and glanced towards Tethys. The man was strong, but then again he was a jounin..but it seemed like it was more than that. He had that shounen main character thing going on. 

"Hey, Tethys, right?"* - Mon Aug 31 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) skates* - Fri Sep 04 14:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikami(Bagholic) whispers: His voice is very irritating to my ears. - Mon Sep 07 22:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) nodded his head in response to Hassan. Seeing as this would give him quite the understanding of his own limitations for future endeavors he was quite willing to put his privacy on the line. Raising his right hand he would begin to channel his chakra throughout his skeletal structure, his bones density increasing significantly whilst simultaneously protruding through his palm into a rather long ivory spike. 

"Alright. Cut this. Or try to atleast." * - Tue Sep 08 00:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) was apparently stabbed in the chest and not the ivory spike he provided, shit happens. While the pain was a bit staggering he took it like a man, not that there was much to take seeing as his bones provided ample defense in regards to the situation. Soon after he was praised by Hassan, if only a little. 

"Thanks, with this I should be able to be a bit more defiant..within reason, bwahaha."* - Tue Sep 08 00:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) shrugs his shoulders before raising his right hand and shifting his fingers into a "gun"like shape. "Bang." he'd state aloud before the bones within his index finger would fly outward, aiming to strike Nozumi in his right shoulder. * - Tue Sep 08 18:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) frowns somewhat as his opponent drops to the ground, koed apparently. He'd then look to his finger and nod slowly. "Welp. I've got a cannon."* - Tue Sep 08 18:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) retained his stoic expression as the man unleashed the ball of flame towards his immediate vicinity. It was a classic technique, but lack luster all the same. Capitalizing on his speed, Baen would begin to skirt away from his current location, allowing the fireballs lack of volume and size to work to his favor, hopefully allowing it to pass by casually. 

That being said he'd continue towards Himura, raising his right palm as he charged forth, his intentions clear. * - Tue Sep 08 19:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) found Himura's lack of ambition a bit disappointing, but, he literally sparked it. Raising his right hand he'd unleash the shrapnel technique that debuted a few minutes earlier. If Himura was truly as inactive as it seemed then it'd land pretty clean into his right shoulder. * - Tue Sep 08 20:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) looked towards Himura as he lay on the ground, bleeding profusely. "Damn, I forgot I had a cannon...Oh well, that's what medics are for. Hey, medic person! We've got a man down." he'd then dust his hands and shuffle off to the side. Awaiting a medic. * - Tue Sep 08 20:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) makes a zipping gesture on his mouth.* - Tue Sep 08 20:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) maintained an emotionless expression as he began to approach Karuzo at a mild pace. If allowed he'd stand in front of Jin and shift into a rather intimidating glare. Jutting his hand out he'd gesture for a shake. 

"Bygones." * - Tue Sep 08 22:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) honestly had never come here to be bygones. He knew what it was, and he just had to confirm before he took it a step further. In truth, when Jin had run from him earlier that was all he needed to know about the man's character. Once their eyes met and Jin shifted into the last bit of his "speech", two bone bullets would be released from his index fingers, aiming for the man's right thigh. 

Given the circumstances dodging would be quite the task, for this was the most ideal situation in which Baen would deal his vengeance. If his surprise attack were to land successfully, he'd take a few steps back and look to Jin, his stoic expression retained. 

"When im talking to you..you don't run. Not from me."* - Tue Sep 08 22:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) shrugged his shoulders before placing his hands in his pockets., . "I hoped for something more...You're just...boring." Turning his head to the side he'd look off into the distance before suddenly performing a single seal, and disappearing suddenly. * - Tue Sep 08 22:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Do all genin gut their own legs? - Tue Sep 08 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) nodded towards Jin as he said his piece. While they may not of got along, this was surely a step in a positive direction. +2 Respect. * - Wed Sep 09 14:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) clapped his hands together after Jin mad his declaration, a somewhat devilish smile appearing upon his face as his mind began to race. "Hell yeah!! This is getting interesting. I like this development." Glancing towards Tethys he'd give him a thumbs up "No time to waste, I suppose~" before performing his own shunshin technique and vacating the vicinity.* - Wed Sep 09 14:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) whistled to himself in his usual fashion as he began to make his way through the village and into the Ossa Manor in which he lived. Not many others were there with him, as he was the last of his kind, or at least the very last few. With that being said he had free reign over the manor and use it as his own personal training field. Today, he'd be training his shunshin technique, a technique that he believes could be used for an interesting form of combat. One that would allow him the capacity to defeat any and all opponents.

Settling himself in a traditional stance, Baen would weave a single seal prior to taking a deep breath. His eyes would shift into a more intimidating appearance as his chakra surged. His movement was sloppy, but it was sharp enough for him to move forward a bit. His skil with the shunshin technique was great, but this was an entirely new application, one he'd need some time to adjust to. 

With his first step having taken him a fair amount of time to perform he'd shift into the next. With this new form of shunshin he would focus on short distance, high speed movements. Movements that would allow him the capacity to shift direction and dance across the battle field. He could feel the wind as he moved, ruffling his snow white locks. He couldn't help but notice that everything almost seemed slower, yet it was blurred all the same.

Smirking to himself he'd halt right before coming into contact with a tree, a collision that would kill any lowly man, one that lacked his unique composition would of surely become nothing but a stain. Fortunately he didn't even have to face such unbecoming circumstance. Coming to an about face, Baen would weave the seal once more as his chakra stimualted his nervous system and leg muscles, sending him at a skyrocketing pace.

The air was refreshing as previously noted but a hair follicle had entered his eye and he lost his concentration, promtping him to fall on his face at an incredibly fast pace. He skid across the floor with much elegance, as awkward as it was, he was still a "dancer". A gash formed on his chin and Baen applied pressure soon after. It would heal, as most of his wounds did. Standing erect and dusting his pants off he'd yawn before heading out of the manor. "That's enough bullshit for one day". 

Returning to his spot of recluse as well as the main motivational point for all the bullshit in which he put Kirigakure through on a daily basis, Baen decided that it was time to return to his shunshin training. If he was going to surpass Urek and become the strongest shinobi of his time, a hurdle such as this could not halt him in the slightest. Unfortunately training was merely something that he would have to do. 

If he could just snap his fingers and awaken his inner potential that would be great, but a prodigy he was not. A hardworker he is. Weaving the single sign he'd begin to activate the muscles throughout his muscular system and charge forth, the air winding through his hair, as well as against his clothing as his speed increase. Normally he'd just go forward, but if he could halt his speed and suddenly increase it in an explosive manner he could change directions. 

Taking a hard step, he turned on his right ankle and felt something crack as a result. Apparently, the weight of his body coupled with his momentum wouldn't allow him to stop, all of this piled atop his ankle had forced the bone to crack and snap. He cried out as he rolled to the ground, his hands cupping said ankle. Due to his unique skeletal abilities, broken bones were little to him, with a bit of chakra and some determination the bone was mended, and he was as good as new. 

Standing erect he'd weave the singular seal again, this time he'd take things a bit slower. "Slow and steady wins the race" Baen told himself as he felt himself accelerate. This time, however, when he began to turn he halted the jutsu in it's entirety, allowing him to become visible for a few seconds, after which he performed it once more and lurched forth. Such a sudden shift made his stomach feel like it was doing backflips, but that's just the price of training. 

"Progress~" he said aloud in a sing song tone of voice, one that many others have heard before. Oddly remniscient of Urek the Mankiller. Perhaps they were related~. Nonetheless, his Shunshin had advanced, he was able to shift directions even if it took him a few seconds and it wasn't truly instantaneous it was definitely a "step" in the right direction. * - Wed Sep 09 14:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) whistles lightly to himself as he witnessed Himura walk up and down the tree as if it were nothing at all. In a normal world he'd be inclined to look for cameras and call bullshit, but he was a trained shinobi who could make use of his skeletal system in a combat situation so he was fine. He didn't really think that Himura would be so eager to train him, but he quickly came to the realization that it was surely a mission of some sort and that he felt nothing in his chest. 

Shrugging his shoulders he'd approach the tree, raising his right foot and placing it against the base of the tree. It was sturdy, sturdy enough to support his weight if it were laying flat, but if he attempted to simply walk up it without any sort of aid he would surely fall victim to gravity's cruel limitations. That being said he'd begin to gather his chakra, congregating it at his feet. 

A light blue tinge was gained as he continued to demonstrate his focus, and within seconds he had a bit of an aura surrounding his feet. "Here goes nothing." he said aloud as he made his way up the tree, only to slide down after he made it a few steps. It was a normal response seeing as this was his first attempt and he had no prior experience. Heck, he doesn't have any real experience with chakra control at all. 

But that didn't stop him, he quickly give it another shot, allowing the chakra to engulf his feet as he lunged for the tree, stomping down quickly and heavily as he attempted to rush his way up the length of the bark. The aggravated chakra use caused the wood to splinter, and as a result he lost his footing, falling to the ground. "Blah blah blah...fucking tree."

Gathering his chakra -one- more time, he'd make a break for it. He was going all or nothing, leaping upon the tree's surface he'd begin his mad dash. With each step he continued higher and higher up the side of the enlarged tree.Eventually it became a bit easier, the ratio of chakra began to reveal itself as he stabilized his run, eventually reaching the top. 

"Fuck yeah."* - Wed Sep 09 21:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // Honestly he didn't really care about the missions. In a sense he really just wanted to leave the village, or do something mildly interesting. Things were getting stale around here and he just needed something to give him that breath of fresh air. Looking to Himura as he proceeded to step upon the water, Baen decided that he might as well get this over with and see what Tethys was talking about. 

Approaching the water himself, the young shinobi would gather his chakra to the soles of his feet. From there he would casually place his right foot atop the everchanging surface that was the body of water. It was difficult to maintain his balance, even with one leg ground, but by no means was he going to take a dip. 

Applying pressure to his leg he'd quickly bring up his other leg and stand atop the water. T'was incredibly shaky at first, prompting him to leap backwards and fall on his ass, but this simply aggravated the Ossa, leading him to immediately stand up and give it another go. Channeling his chakra he'd simply run onto the surface of the liquid, skating across the slick "ground" and nearly face planting into the lake. Fortunately, his momentum began to slow and he placed his hands into the water. Using his chakra he kept himself afloat. 

Despite how taxing the task was, he had to perservere, nobody wanted to get wet. "Shit, Shit, Shit..." he said aloud before running back to the ground, nearly kissing the grass as he exhaled in relief. "Alright...Hey, I guess it worked." * - Wed Sep 09 22:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) raised an eyebrow as he settled his gaze upon the so called "Prince". Thanks to Jin he was a bit up to speed on how things worked and what he would have to do, or not do, to keep things running smoothly in the village. Although, from the looks of it Baen was having a bit of trouble in the self control department. He hated the whole "looking down on others" sort of thing. Especially if he was just a noble who hadn't worked a day in his life. While he would reserve judgement, he already didn't like the smell of things. Not to mention he called them "Henchman". 

"Oh..A prince...Ahaha. S-splendid...How...wonderful.~" * - Thu Sep 10 22:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) couldn't sense chakra so his ass was ignorant to what the fuck he had growing in his pants. * - Thu Sep 10 22:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) his jaw dropped to the floor as he contemplated the insult. It was clear that Tethys wouldn't just let this slide, and if he did...well Baen would probably be too shocked to even say a word. In the meantime, he glanced towards Jin, and maintained his stupified look. "Yo...." He took a step to the left as shit was about to get hectic. "He about to kill a Gezo heir. He about to become the most infamous man alive. He's about to pull a luffy." He thought to himself. * - Thu Sep 10 23:07:44 2015

It was clear that the man wouldn't simply let him leave, a theory that was supported by the weaving of handseals in sudden succession. "Fuck me." he thought to himself as the lightning began to arc from the man's hands. Gripping a few tags from his back pouch, he'd make a quick move and throw them towards the jutsu, all the while continuing his exit.

His only saving grace was his speed, and from the looks of it he was faster than his pursuers. Making use of the explosive tags, well, explosive nature. He'd hope to offset the jutsu's advance, if only by a small margin, allowing him to partake in his own jutsu, involving a singular handseal and incredibly fast movement, to make his way out of the situation. * - Sun Sep 13 01:08:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) was almost interested as to why Jin had taken it upon himself to teach Baen a new jutsu, despite their history. But he began to think back, they had connected a few days prior and hopefully it briged the gap. Or maybe they just had that whole naruto sasuke thing going on who knew. Observing carefully as Jin began to gather his chakra, the hairs on the back of his neck and arms shifting slightly as he did so. "I see.." eh thought to himself before crossing his arms upon his chest. 

As jin released the chakra he'd raise his eyebrow as the jutsu was cast and completed. Apparently the sudden release of chakra would negate a genjustu, . Although Baen lacked much experience with Genjutsu this would make it a very "meh" skill. But if anything, this is why he needed it even more. Nodding his head, he'd begin to gather his own chakra, allowing it to compact within the center of his network. he simply allowed the chakra to build and flow to this one specific point. 

Within seconds he released the chakra, allowing the hair upon his body to stand on edge for a brief second, only to fall limp soon after. The technique wasn't a success, but it wasn't a failure either. He could tell simply from the feeling, perhaps it was his experience with hard work that simply told him such a thing, or maybe he was secretly a prodigy like his friend Jin over there. From the outside looking in, it'd be pretty hard to discern. 

Raring up for his second go, he'd tense his muscles as his chakra began to rise somewwhat, almost stirring even. If one were to pay fair attention to Baen they'd notice that the areas beneath his clothes were beginng to shift in almost inhuman ways. It would look gross for sure, but it was his lack of chakra control that promtped his "bones" to react in an odd manner. Exhaling deeply he'd release the chakra as his har stood on end, his bones retracting to their rightful places as he did so. "Ah, that wasn't so hard~"* - Sun Sep 13 19:52:44 2015
