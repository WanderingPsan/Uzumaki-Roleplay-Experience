However, the thought of fucking up this guy's plan is fairly amusing, and so he thought. What better way to piss him off than running? Cowardly? Perhaps, but it's all a game to Baen and he already had a saved game with Bryson. A new arrival would simply spoil it.

As Yan began reaching the end of his declaration, Baen would perform a single seal and well, Vanish. Appearing somewhere out of eyesight perhaps, if they lacked any attribute.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: The way you worded that leads me to believe that Baen is certainly a powerful man. Considering your own capabilities, even without the immortality. Hm..Do you think I should be expecting results from him? - Tue Sep 29 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Baen is as trustworthy as they come. - Tue Sep 29 22:50:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: That says alot about him. Thank you.  - Tue Sep 29 22:51:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Baen is one of those hotheads that move with the wind on purpose while being a single flame.. - Tue Sep 29 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Dangerous..? Yes. Efficient..? Yes. Reliable..? Yes. - Tue Sep 29 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: That.. is just what I wanted to hear. Thank you for your honesty, I've noticed that most shinobi tend to lie more often than not in these times. Many of the people in Kirigakure to be specific. - Tue Sep 29 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Also; I haven't seen Taiga around, he is a Konohagakure shinobi, isn't he?  - Tue Sep 29 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Come to think of it.. - Tue Sep 29 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I haven't seen him since the bounty was made public. - Tue Sep 29 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: So he's scared then?.. That also means he doesn't trust you or I, I suppose thats good. On his part anyways.. - Tue Sep 29 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: -- .. Hm. - Tue Sep 29 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: What is your opinion on Ushinawa? - Tue Sep 29 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Ushinawa..? I don't know too much about him, honestly.. I've spoken with him and form alliances with him, but recent information makes it seem like that alliance is nothing more than a "get power quick" scheme. - Tue Sep 29 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I've known him for a while, I'd even go as far as to consider him on my friendly side along side you and a few others. He has gone out of his way to help me at times, but again. Not everyone is trustworthy. - Tue Sep 29 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I can't supply you an answer without being biased in some way, shape or form. - Tue Sep 29 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Then share your bias with me. - Tue Sep 29 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: As I said, potential betrayal has been placed in my ears, so I personally seek no reason to have ties with him until I clear out the wax. - Tue Sep 29 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That being said, allowing him in on such a delicate matter will led to destruction. - Tue Sep 29 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Keep in mind, Ushinawa is still a shinobi within this shinobi world. - Tue Sep 29 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I see. So would it be safe to assume you don't want anything to do with him, for the time being? - Tue Sep 29 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Correct. - Tue Sep 29 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Still, I wish not to get in between your relationship with him. - Tue Sep 29 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: The man was the second person to see my eyes, when they came to be. - Tue Sep 29 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Hm.. - Tue Sep 29 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: What do you think If I kept the details vague, and simply put a bounty on someone specific to see his reaction to the job itself?  - Tue Sep 29 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That'd be doable, but I suggest making the bounty for the person as a whole. - Tue Sep 29 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Rather than the person's eyes. - Tue Sep 29 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Thats what I was getting at. - Tue Sep 29 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Edge or Taiga. Both people I want, but I only know one of their skillsets. - Tue Sep 29 23:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Taiga seems relatively simple to take care of; I believe even I could have handled it if I really went for it.. - Tue Sep 29 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: So that leaves Edge. - Tue Sep 29 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Send Ushinawa after Edge. - Tue Sep 29 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Leave Taiga to Baen. - Tue Sep 29 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Yes.. that seems like the best idea.  - Tue Sep 29 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ... Interesting. - Tue Sep 29 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Erebus, you yourself are quite acquinted with death. Right? - Tue Sep 29 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm. - Tue Sep 29 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: What do you think about the possibility of someone to control the dead? Is that plausible? - Tue Sep 29 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Control.. the dead..? - Tue Sep 29 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Very much, yes - Tue Sep 29 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I mean.. - Tue Sep 29 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah.. I can see it happening. - Tue Sep 29 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: It seems Ushinawa is lead to believe that Edge may have capabilities to do such. - Tue Sep 29 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: He has also agreed to do what he can to bring Edge in. - Tue Sep 29 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Regardless, Baen also knows about Edge having what I want as well.. so I could care less which one brings him in. As long as he's brought. - Tue Sep 29 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: What about you? Rather than what I'm planning. Anything you are looking forward too? - Tue Sep 29 23:43:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: He made her a shinobi of Kumogakure. - Wed Sep 30 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: And called her his sister. - Wed Sep 30 00:26:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Kastya had a daughter... Right..? - Wed Sep 30 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Fujitora mentioned Ko-Ko to be in the same clan as him, that means Fujitora also has the ability to unlock the same eyes as her... - Wed Sep 30 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: She did. - Wed Sep 30 00:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) frowned somewhat as his hand was denied by Taiga. However, instead of retracting it in it's entirety he would move a bit closer, edging it forward as if to say "Take it. Do it. Now." 

"C'mmmooooon."* - Sat Oct  3 22:53:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) noticed that Taiga had begun to move backwards, attempting to create some distance between himself and the "murderer". "Well then." he thought to himself as he crafted a single seal, appearing at Taiga's side, his arms crossed upon his chest. 

"C'mon. Let's not do this."* - Sat Oct  3 23:12:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What's happening here? - Sat Oct  3 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) pursed his lips as everyone seemed to be attacking him for what seemed to be no reason. Creepy? Yes. Hostile? No? He hadn't really done anything major, but  apparently they thought he was the end all shinobi and had to be away with him. 

As Taiga swung his sword he'd quickly slip to the side, making use of his reflexes to lead him away from the blade and to the man's side. Effectively avoiding the fire run, unless it were to suddenly phase through Taiga and into Baen. Regardless he'd stand relatively still, opening his palms towards Taiga as if to say "what the fuck?" chuckling a bit to himself he'd go on to say.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) says: Oh, such a confrontaion going about... I should move out of the way - Sun Oct  4 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) had apparently still been holding onto Taiga, creating a rather interesting situation as the man attempted stab him from such a close distance. There was little he could do in response to the stab. Dodging would require reflexes that he may not have, and to block would surely bring about burns if he were to use his bare hands. And so he opted for the obvious choice. 

Within seconds bones burst forth from Baen's form, his ribcage becoming pronounced as the ivory spikes lurched forth. Just about every portion of his body had unleashed a skeletal cover, including his hands, which would pierce Taiga's hand, causing him a great deal of pain. The blade would surely clash against his defenses if it continued.  Leading Baen to furrow his eyebrow and tighten the grip upon Taiga's hand. 

His personality took a sharp turn as he glanced towards Kang. "Move and he dies." Turning his attention back towards Taiga he would frown 

"You just gave me a reason, child."* - Sun Oct  4 00:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) released his bones from Taiga's hand and slowly began to raise his hand. Naturally he was going to kill him, and the lack of response from his comrades was a bit discerning. Clenching his fist, he would drive the fist down towards the man's head, aiming to pierce his skull and well...kill him.

However, he was a man of games, and he almost wanted to see this play out. As a result, he halted his fist just from contact, and retracted the bones around his fist. He's tap the boy on his head and ruffle his hair. 

"Taiga. Get stronger. This is boring." Looking towards Kang he'd raise his eyebrow and shrug his shoulders before making his leave via shunshin. He had reason to let them live, a few of them actually. But leaving them mysterious was a bit more interesting. * - Sun Oct  4 00:49:55 2015
