<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) raises his right arm over his left shoulder, a bone would soon protrude from aforementioned apendage, piercing his clothing but he didn't seem to care much. A sharpened sword of bone would soon become apparent as Baen gripped it's "hilt" and twirled it through the air. 

"Yeah, it's nothing special. The bone's are the easier part. It's the technique you use with it that makes it a "Dance". He'd then lunge forward, deciding to use Kyubishu as a target as he stabbed his blade forth, numerous afterimages would slip into reality as he continued his thrusts. None of the strikes were aimed to actually hit the boy, just nick his clothing.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // Honestly Baen had no clue as to what he should do in this situation, not in the battle but life, he had suddenly become Tethys. He sighed to himself as things had quickly escalated, he felt similar to someone who was suddenly accused of impregnating a foreign woman and being forced into child support. It was clear that he would surely assist his family members, but he wasn't really the type to nurture anyone. 

While they did look to Baen as a strong shinobi he had to establish a pecking order, one that would hold strong even after they elevated to a strength that neared his own. There was only one way to do that. Opening his arms, he'd accept the attack a confident smirk upon his face as Kyubishu lunged. Upon contact he'd note that he couldn't pierce his skin, and even if he could he'd come into contact with his second defensive layer known as "Bone Armor". 

"Is this all...Kyubishu?" he'd state before flaring his chakra in a rather violent manner. Within seconds flames would shoot from both his hands, aiming to engulf Kyubishu in a torrent of fire that would surely cause him a great deal of pain. However, he would not burn him to such a high degree, instead he would merely cause him to back off. Regardless, he would withdraw the flames, manipulating them into a small circle surrounding his feet. 

"Shishishi. * - Fri Oct 30 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) nodded his head in acceptance as the boy continued to charge forward. It was certain that he had the tenacity of the Ossa clan, something that Baen himself had treasured. As he attempted to strike out the bone placed upon his knee, Baen would remain still, his arms crossed upon his chest as he took to a different approach. 

His eyes would narrow as he unleashed the full brunt of his killing intent towards the young shinobi. If successful Kyubishu would suddenly become overwhelmed by visions of his own death as a result of his foolish strike. A forest of bones would rise around Baen, skewering Kyubishu, his bones snapping and splintering as they came into contact with the hardened steel that was Baen's Shikotsumyaku. 

Fortunately, it was all a vision, one that would break the shinobi, or atleast leave him hesistant to charging forth.

His flesh would rend and split as an ivory blade was produced from his skeletal structure, it was of decent size, not as long as a katana but a smidge longer than a tanto. His left arm would go limp as he slowly began to inch forward.

"Heh, that rhymed...I should switch to poetry~" he thought to himself.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) as soon as Mizumi began to weave his seals he knew that something was up, I mean...they're handseals.

As the water was unleashed towards him he'd leap to his left side, aiming to land upon the fence. Performing a single seal he'd shunshin from the fence to his camelia blade, removing it from the fence and twirling it about. 

He'd note that both Asteroth and Ichiro fled the scene, causing him to narrow his eyes just a bit. 

"I can be persuaded not to kill Mizumi, honestly i'm doing it cause i'm bored...But if those two pull anything. Anything at all. I will raze this shit to the ground. I will make it my personal mission to end all that you have established, simply because I feel like it. If you can stop them, I would...Now, Sado.

However, he would soon find out as Mizumi's clones performed the syrup trap, causing Baen to leap into the air and stand upon the fence, he took a quick survey of the area, noting Asteroth incanting some shit and Ichiro with a small force of one hundred shinobi.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) pursed his lips in an awkward fashion, he just wanted to fight the army now and everyone was out here trying to gun him down. I guess this is what he asked for in a sense. But he honestly just wanted to outdo the Hiramekarei god, and take out a whole army. 

Performing a single seal he'd shunshin from his place on the fence to the far right up to the edge, by which point he would be perpendicular to the approaching army, if everything was as Mizumi had depicted, the wave would of fizzled by time it reached his position, if not, it was nothing to shunshin once more to the opposing fence. 

Noting the giant turtle like entity he'd raise his eyebrow. "Oh look, a summon. What happens when Summons die?" he thought to himself. As the stream of water was unleashed he'd make use of his reflexes to avoid the stream, given the distance it shouldn't be that hard, hopefully. * - Sun Nov  1 08:13:39 2015

"1."

Baen's hands would begin to raise into the air as a rather insidious, almost devilish smirk began to encroach upon his face.  

"2." 

His chakra began to flare as he began to prepare for some sort of fanciful technique. All the other words from those he deemed unimportant began to fade into the background as the will of death moved forth. 

"3." 

Tightening his fingers into a fist he'd begin to lower his hands as he quickly took a deep breath, his eyes closing for a brief moment. 

"4."

He quickly formed a single seal as his chakra raged to it's utmost highest point, nearly becoming visible off his person as his chakra began to mold and form into one of his strongest techniques.

"5...!"

his eyes opened into a narrow fashion as he cast forth his technique. The ground began to quiver as his chakra took hold of the earth itself. The ground began to cave in as bone after bone began to rise from the darkened depths. They would spread in a three hundred and sixty degree fashion around Baen, all within his line of sight would fall victim to his indiscrimanent attack. The ivory spikes would tower as high as the tallest tree, and tear Amegakure asunder. Numerous shinobi, if not all in the vicinity, would lose their lives as they were pierced by the "trees" and their sharpened branches. Blood would rain down upon the unexpecting as the tree's multiplied, aiming to breach the heart of the village. As for the more skilled shinobi, i.e. players, their fate would rest solely on how fast they reacted, as well as their ingenuity.

Should one enter his room they would notice a few abnormal qualities about his living quarters as it was divded symmetrically vertically down the middle. The left side was white as snow, a large chair and small mattress on the floor with linen sheets. Upon further inspection it would appear that the sheets were frozen over, as if they were exposed to the winter elements. The right side bore a similar arrangement of furniture, but the chair was adorned with numerous black splotches and a lingering smell of smoke. 

At the center of the room sat "Sixty-Nine", the experiment of the evening. There he sat, quiet, unmoving, docile. A single jacket wrapped tightly around his forearms, equipped with a leash chaining him to the farthest wall within the room. Normally, Sixty-nine was well behaved but it was something about that new guard, it lit a fire in him...and so he lit a fire in "him". And so they gave him a straight jacket. He'd thought out breaking free numerous times, but he could never go through with it. Perhaps it's because he felt he couldn't, or maybe he feared what would happen next. Nonetheless, he maintained his solitary confinement. 

His eyes opened occasionally to reveal his Heterochromia iris'. Assuming those guys entered the room he'd retain his position and his dull expression. He was in a rare moment of balance, where both six and nine were docile. Or perhaps they were waiting for their opportunities. * - Thu Dec  3 21:34:56 2015

His gaze traveled from person to person, noting that they all had vastly different personalities. As his eyes settled on Yuriko's he noticed that she too had the same visionary defect as he did. Perhaps she could perform a similar ability? Having remained silent for far too long he'd clear his throat before speaking in a casual manner. 

"You are?"* - Thu Dec  3 22:03:56 2015

"Take me out..?" his voice trailed as he understood the weight of such a statement. He was imprisoned for such a long time. He even staged a few botched attempts at escape but to no avail. And here comes this ragtag group of experiments just barging in and claiming that they are here to free him. Was it a trap by his tormentors? Or were the gods above finally cutting him a break? 

The gentle hand of Yuriko upon his left cheek caused "Nine" to stir within his psyche. As a result an odd smirk curled upon his lips. "If you're promising freedom, i'm sure "Frosty" won't mind if I take the helm for a bit. If it's a trap..I won't hesistate to leave you're corpse a nice shade of black~."

Standing Erect, "Nine" would display his genetic mutation as the left side of his body began to heat up considerably, the straight jacket that held him began to smolder until a it burst into a bright red flame. With his left arm free he'd wriggle out his right until he was completely unhindered.

Things were getting hectic on the way side. Apparently things began to pop off as the shinobi of the hidden mist village took to hostile actions against his comrades. Naturally the sensors within the army were keeping a close watch on the numbers and as things escalated, Six took control of the helm. With a few words of encouragement, much less than he thought, they began to act. 

With a group of about fivehundred shinobi of varying expertise and profession, he'd essentially storm the gates of Kirigakure, for extraction purposes of course. Nonetheless, things would get a bit hectic should the small congregation of shinobi prolong their aggression. However, with such a large "distraction" it shouldn't be that difficult to escape. 

The shinobi that accompanied Six would charge forward in a zig zagging motion, a number of flak vested men and woman would leap throughout the area aiming to interrupt and distract the attacking shinobi so that Yuriko and company could escape. Any aggressive action would attempt to be withstood, as this was not a war, but evacuation. * - Sat Dec  5 02:22:04 2015
