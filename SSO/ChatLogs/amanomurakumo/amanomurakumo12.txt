<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) throws an ashbone.* - Tue Oct 20 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) reached on his back and gripped the spear, chucking it towards the man's chest with great force. Immediately afterwards he would perform a single seal as his speed was enhanced in a rather instantaneous fashion, allowing him to appear at Tetsujin's side. However, instead of the normal smoke cloud that encompasses such an appearance, Baen would be wreathed in flame. 

Thrusting his fist forward he would aim to strike the iron man's side, to test the waters so to speak. It was a two pronged attack, and while it would probably fall short upon the man's iron hide, it was surely a testament to his skill.* - Tue Oct 20 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) hadn't really done as much damage as initially hoped, but he was a patient man. However, his opponents counterattack was surely one for the books. Suddenly breaking pieces of yourself off and firing them at your opponent? Where had Baen seen that before? Oh right. 

Narrowing his eye's he'd raise his arms to defend against the strike, mostly to protect his face. While he lacked any armor externally, his thickened hide and internal skeletal armor would provide quite the obstacle to hurdle. If everything went smoothly he'd stumble backward, whilst lowering his hands towards Tetsujin, his fingers aimed his general direction. 

"We're a bit similar, you and I." he'd state aloud before unleashing his own onslaught of shrapnel, of the bone persuasion.* - Tue Oct 20 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) slipped into a more lowered stance, one that would surely optimize the ensuing technique. Within seconds bones sprouted from Baen's form, giving him a somewhat more menacing form, or perhaps ridiculous depending on your spectrum. 

'Let's" he'd state as he charged forth, swaying from side to side as he began his dance. He'd begin by leaping into the air and rotating in a violent fashion, aiming to send the sharpened spears into Tetsujin's hardened exterior. This would be the true test of durability. * - Tue Oct 20 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) maintained his vision mid rotation, his sight was well trained and he wasn't one to offer his opponent any leverage when performing his techniques. Tetsujin's iron constructs would offer a worthy counter to Baen's ivory spears, and he was certain that this man was his true rival.

However, his technique would not end with a simple rotation. A sudden spike in chakra would bring about an increase in temperature followed by flames sprouting from his person, augmenting his rotational nature. Where his bones would seek a defensive ground from the iron, the flames would aim to wash over Tetsujin. They lacked the true definition of a crafted technique, but they were potent in their own right.

Should his flames provide an effective distraction, he'd land to Tetsujin's left, where he would attempt to skirt around his opponent, making use of his natural born speed to capitalize on his opponents heavier weight. * - Tue Oct 20 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // It was clearly a deadlock, if anything the two shinobi would be killed by a passing Hassan before either had struck the kiling blow, they would need to get creative. Bone as hard as metal and Iron as hard as...metal. How would the two bypass each others defenses to the gooey death bits inside. Baen had an idea, but it would surely be risky, if it worked at that. Now, it was all about the setup. 

As the razor'd edge that was Tetsujin's kick began to edge towards him, he'd take a step backward, allowing the strike to pass by before he took a quick instep, his bladed palm lurching forward with great force and speed. To further augment his lunge he'd unleash a brief torrent of fire from his elbow, perhaps granting him the required propulsion to pierce such a hardened foe. * - Tue Oct 20 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // His strike was whisked away with relative ease, causing him a bit of grief as his plans had suddenly been reduced to nothing but the sound of bone on cold steel. He'd take a quick step back as he recalled his bones, shifting into a more offensive "dance". Withdrawing a bone of sword from his shoulder he'd slink to his left side, as his arm was temporarily limp due to the lack of actual bone. 

"I live not to handle, I live to kill. Iron or not, all shall submit to the mankiller." his tone was stoic yet laced with a smidget of venom. 

He charged forth and began his dance if allowed, his sword thrusting harder and faster than Shinjin when he fucks Hana. Numerous feints were applied, aiming to capitalize upon Tetsujin's lack of reflexive capacity to draw his blade or perhaps his attention to strikes which would surely fall short. He just needed one strike. * - Tue Oct 20 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // As the bone struck his target, Baen saw his ambition fufilled. "It's now!" he thought to himself as he suddenly unleashed a rather potent wave of flame from the tip of his blade. His manipulative skill was novice at best, but from such a close proximity perhaps even he could weaken the "Iron Man". Seeing as his focus was centered solely on his technique, he'd fall victim to the strike at his ankles, his balance disturbed as he began to lean towards the ground. 

"Shit." * - Tue Oct 20 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // With his last technique proving fruitful in a more depressing manner, Baen would focus more so on how he would bounce back and continue his onslaught. However, Tetsujin had officially taken off the kiddy gloves. His arm blades had undergone a transformation of sorts, a slight change at best, but it was still apparent. The atmosphere of their shared proximity had taken a turn for the worst, leaving Baen to suddenly tense. 

The blade lurched forth, aiming for his sternum, to which Baen would erect his Larch dance, his bone armor already active from a prior engagement. With his most elaborate defenses in place, he'd have to face the Sky Scorcher head on. But even Baen knew that his defense would fall short, so he had to mitigate the damage somehow. Rolling as best he could in such sandy terrain he'd aim to shift the target to his left shoulder. The height of iron assimilation techniques would pierce his defenses, causing him to cry a defeaning roar of pain and anguish. * - Tue Oct 20 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Lmaooo - Tue Oct 20 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // Suddenly, everything felt like it was submerged, the pain was excrutiating. He could feel blood dripping onto his clothing, hell, it was the first time he had felt anything in a -long- time. It was a bit of a shock to him no doubt, but he was certain he would pull through, he had to. Mustering as much strength as possible, the young Ossa would raise his right leg and thrust his spiked foot towards Tetsujin, in the hopes of creating a bit of distance, his free hand nursing the wound. 

At first glance it was clear that Baen was injured, if the bleeding wound hadn't proven it then his notoriously upkept hair, which was now in shambles, would surely be testament. Raising his gaze towards Tetsujin he'd issue a glare, his killing intent surging.

"I'll not take your pity, it disgraces me. I am the Oni of the Withered Forest"

With that being said, he'd usher forth his own ultimate technique. The sand would quake and rumble briefly before giving way to a rather serious shift in terrain. Incredibly large and thick sharpened trees of bone would protrude from the ground, all expanding and growing rather violently. Their branches would threaten to pierce Tetsujin whilst simultaneously raising him into the air. Skewering him if successful. 

"Welcome, to my home."
* - Tue Oct 20 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) Sighed a breath of relief once he witnessed the man break into many tiny pieces, all of which would spread amongst the air, allowing Baen to breath easy. Or so he thought. Upon hearing the man's voice he'd instantly look in the direction in which it originated. 

"You've got to be fucking kidding me. What is he. What. Is. This." he said aloud, only to quickly get his answer via Tetsujin's stand out monologue. "Where you are Iron, I am bone!" he'd roar as he leapt onto one of his many bone pillars, phasing into them on some Tobi shit. With such tactical advantage he couldn't pass up the opportunity. He'd wait in the "forest" ever watching, waiting for an opportunity. * - Tue Oct 20 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) flows effortlessly throughout the bones. It was clear that he had the highground, but what good would that do if he couldn't truly defeat his opponent. It was then that it hit him. Slipping his upper body from the "trunk" of one of the "trees" he'd fire a sudden burst of flame towards Tetsujin via his manipulatory skills. He'd whistle in his direction, almost mockingly. * - Tue Oct 20 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // After retreating into his "forest of white" (Title of his sex tape), Baen would appear on the opposite side of the forest, spewing more flames. His flames were unfocused, wild, and unpredictable. But they would do the job. He'd repeat the process a number of times, up to about 5 before withdrawing into his bone forest for the final time. 

Hopefully, the iron would be pretty hot at this point, and as the saying says. You must strike while the iron is hot. Appearing from a branch nearing the fated spear of destiny, Baen would place said spear into his mouth and form a single seal. If anyone were to notice it would be the ram, leading Baen into his final rush. 

A full on shunshin tackle into heated metal, fun, but his goal was to slam Tetsujin into an ivory tree, and pin him for the time being. Hopefully with his speed and his opponents lack there of it would go off smoothly. But there was always room for improvement. * - Tue Oct 20 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // Alas, the clock chimes on the final hour as Baen's plan has finally come into fruition. Tightening his grip upon the spear he'd begin to shift into his final segments, unleashing a wave of flame from the base of the spear down it's shaft onto Tetsujin himself. The heated effects of his previous distractions may have been waning, but this was surely rekindle the flame. 

He was too close to dodge at this point, both figuratively and literally, besides he wasn't going to abandon his position. His resolve was truly steel forged in the heat of battle. The blade would strike against his side, causing him to wince in pain but his defenses could withstand it, if only for a few moments longer. 

"Handle? Oh no, "Iron Man". I will burn you, till all that remains will be whispers of your exploits." The intensity of the flame would continue to increase in both size and temperature as Baen poured his chakra into his wild flames. 

"Burn!"* - Tue Oct 20 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // The fight had reached it's conclusion. With Baen left standing as it's sole winner, his resolve only heightened as he was able to defeat the Iron man, and consequentially "The Legend Killer" himself. He took a step back to take it all in, a smirk creeping upon his face as Tetsujin explained his death in a rather fitting fashion. 

"Heh, I guess i'm not just brawn~" his tone was lackluster, he was rather exhausted and his injuries were piling. As the man combust into flames, leaving nothing but a blackened skeletal figure, Baen would tense somewhat. On the surface he felt he had defeated such a grandiose opponent, but he couldn't help but shake this feeling that he was simply transforming into something that transcended humanity. Perhaps this was the fate of those who bore the title "Legend Killer". A fate that Baen was sure to succumb to himself. 

"I shall bear it with Honor."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) made a nice burial for his fallen "Comrade". He'd set the spear in the midst of the bone forest as planned. Ushering a Silent prayer after doing so. 

"For Urek."* - Tue Oct 20 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) stumbles in all crazy like, he was bleeding from his left shoulder and he had no shirt on. Aka, real nigga.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) took a seat on the cool stone at his feet, shrugging his shoulder only to wince briefly. "Ah well. I guess even Legends come home every once in a while~" He chuckled at his "joke", before exhaling deeply. 

"Just do what you can, stop the bleeding if possible."* - Tue Oct 20 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) relaxed as the healing light came over him, washing him in a mix of blue and green hues. "Ah...That's nice...And..I might as well have. That's what Urek did, bwahahaa. But, now...We are the same. I killed the man who killed him, I am beyond him now~." he was talking in circles, or maybe riddles. He was a bit off kilter with the blood loss, but it was clear he was excited about something important. * - Tue Oct 20 03:41:26 2015
