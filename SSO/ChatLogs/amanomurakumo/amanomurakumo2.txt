<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: If they were stronger than us they would of attacked us outright and crushed us from the start. They'd have no reason to wait.  - Mon Sep 14 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Do you not think that maybe they have a plan for once we go after them? Do you not think that they just wouldn't think we might come after them. For all we know, their whole side is littered with traps to spring. Or prepared jutsus that will wipe out most of our men.  - Mon Sep 14 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: In war there are no ranking differences. It's a matter of what you can do and how well you can do it. I had a Genin on the front lines with me that took out half the amount of troops I took out. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: That's impressive. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Lets not even go beyond the fact, they might have a second force in hiding. Waiting to hit the village while we go after them, or flank us in any direction they wish. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Stop thinking of yourself as a mere Genin and think of yourself as a shinobi of the Allied Force. - Mon Sep 14 13:41:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: And thats the first part of a successful shinobi is deception. What you believe they can't do or what you think is the obvious answer, turns out to be the wrong one. - Mon Sep 14 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: You can't fear the unkown it's war. At this point any decision we make will be followed by the unknown. - Mon Sep 14 13:43:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) gave a curt bow before smirking in a casual fashion. "Baen of the Ossa." his tone was carefree, and a bit sarcastic for personal reasons. Raising his right hand he'd start the spars as he usually did, by firing a projectile. Making a "gun" gesture with his fingers he'd drop the "hammer" and fire two bone bullets towards Yan. One aimed for the left shoulder, the other his thigh.

Glancing towards Koji he'd chuckle. "Two on one...?"* - Mon Sep 14 14:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Namuko(Darkcore1245) says: ... - Mon Sep 14 14:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: No! - Mon Sep 14 14:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) maintained his stoic expression as the clones appeared to tank his shrapnel technique. It was almost disappointing. Everyone else he had fought had aken two bullets to the body, and that was that. Apparently Sunagakure shinobi were built to last. 

Taking off, Baen would charge forward closing the distance between himself and Yan in an instant. Once he approached, he'd stand relatively still and wait to see if he'd do anything cool that could prompt retaliation. * - Mon Sep 14 14:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Well you need stop having that mindset becasue we need you - Mon Sep 14 14:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: There are plenty of others...that could fulfill my role... - Mon Sep 14 14:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) began to whistle as the two clones unleashed twin rivers of mud, which were aimed to converge upon his person. Making use of his capacity to dodge, coupled with his speed, he'd divert his course to the right. Lacking by a small margin in the reflexive department, Baen would find his left leg covered in mud. Fortunately his defense were sturdy and his evasion was halted only momentarily. 

As the true Yan released his "raging waves" Baen would fall back on his natural ability, Shikotsumyaku. Bones would protrude from his person, specifically his feet as he used them as a means of his stabilizing himself against the wave of water, whilst simultaneously raising his arms in a "x" gesture. 

"Elementalists always ruining my clothes and shit." he said, seeing as he was rooted in the ground for the time being. * - Mon Sep 14 14:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Bone manipulation? Thats different... - Mon Sep 14 14:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) wiped his shoulders off as the torrent of water had caused him quite the discomfort, he didn't fancy being wet all that much. After gauging the distance between himselfand Yan he'd nod his head before charging in once more, aiming to shift into a more comfortable setting. If allowed he'd approach the Shinobi and reach out for his collar, aiming to keep him within his reach. If the clones were to run defense, well, he'd handle them all the same. * - Mon Sep 14 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: It would be hard to palm with a bone manipulater.. is it the perfect counter against my technique? - Mon Sep 14 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: Yan has definitely faced a faster challenger, but it's clear this guy's speed is no joke either. how will yan overcome it? - Mon Sep 14 14:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) // Of course he anticipated such a move on part of the clones. For what use would they be if not to protect their creator. As the first clone approached, Baen would begin to sway back and forth as he approached, numerous bones appearing from the joints upon his body, elbows, knees, shoudlers, palms, etc. 

Once the clone reached for him, Baen would hop gently off the ground whilst spinning rapidly, aiming to cut through the earth clone, all the while capitalizing on his momentum. Instead of dwelling on the clone he would stab and move forward, skirting around the jutsu as he continued forward, perhaps removing himself from the proximity of the mud shower. 

When participating in this dance, his speed would increase considerably, or at least that's how it looked. As the river of mud approached, he'd leap into the air, spinning in a graceful manner to avoid whilst jutting out the bones in his elbows and palm to strike the clone, retracting them swiftly. 

While the mud would cover his bones, as they were the majority of hs attacks, he'd be clean for the most part, and free to approach Yan once more. * - Mon Sep 14 14:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: I wonder how durable he is with those bones... I can cut him up a bit without getting yelled at - Mon Sep 14 14:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) but suddenly he stopped before reaching Yan and withdrew his bones. "I'll be right back." Real life called. * - Mon Sep 14 14:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) //Baen was just a real ass nigga who wanted to do real ass things. As of the last few weeks he had been resolving to perform a certain style of fighting, one that he assumed Tethys would be attempting to perform aswell. If he could perhaps be a bit faster than him in it's conception then maybe, just maybe, he could be worthy of standing at the man's side. Baen quickly took to his manor where he practiced a majority of his jutsu and got to work. 

Forming a single seal, Baen would gather his chakra and distribute it throughout his legs. The muscles would tense in preparation for the jutsu. He could already feel the capacity for his speed increase as his chakra ignited within him. Taking off at a breakneck speed, Baen would begin flying across one side of the Manor to the next. The wind in his hair, the ruffling of his clothes as he "flew" it was a lovely sensation, one that he enjoyed quite sincerely. 

It wasn't until the next part of his movement that he hated just about everything. Turning. To maintain this speed and suddenly halt his acceleration and then accelerate once more was more than he could handle. While he had the optimal body and structure to maintain the force of the speed, he lacked the mental fortitude. The last time he partook in such activities he broke his ankle, but it did heal rather quickly so he thought, "meh, what the hell."

Exiting the acceleration he'd appear for a brief moment, turning his ankle and then performing the seal once more. He'd take off in a direction perpendicular to his initial movement. Normally, it would only cause him grief but this time it seemed to work out pretty well, despite the groaning of bones he could almost hear, but definitely feel within his ankle. Without a moment to spare he continued his speed, increasing it as if he wanted to tear into another dimension. 

The wind became almost unbearale as he maintained his momentum. Trying to push through it and continue his training."If I can't even bear it for the second motion...how am I supposed to craft an entire fighting style." Gritting his teeth Baen slammed his foot into the ground as he took a second step, the "unbearableness" be damned, he would press forward. He was an Ossa god damn it. 

"I'm an Ossa God damn it!" he roared as he leapt into the air, assisted by his continued momentum sending him rocketing through the air as if he were some sort of human bullet. It wasn't until he felt the weightlessness of it all that he pursed his lips in an awkward fashion. "Well shit." he said aloud while flapping his arms, hoping that he would suddenly sprout wings and learn to fly. Unfortunately no sch thing would take place and he would enter free fall. 

With little to nothing on his side to assist him he'd just fall down into the manor. Well, he did try his very best to avoid fallng flat on his face, which could very well be the end of him. "Take a deep breath, focus on the chakra, if I can just reach a tree.." leaning himself through the air he'd begin to roll, preparing himself to strike into a tree branch. With a single seal held he grit his tetth as he landed upon the branch. It snapped immediately. 

Despite the branchs immediate break, he could use this. As long as he had a platform, as long as he could feel it under him, this -would- work. "Fuck it!" he roared as he activated shunshin, making use of the sudden acceleration to reach a new branch, and then another, and then another. He was surely landing each and evvery mark, sending him closer and closer to the ground whilst simulataneously practicing his technique. 

He landed with a thud and a rolled onto his ass. It was clear that he had successfully staved off death from falling from the atmosphere, and thus he could call this training session a success. 

The final portion of his training, or atleast the portion that would allow him access to the style in of itself was finallly nearing its end. Baen had completed a few feats that allowed him a bit morecontrol in regards to the control of the Shunshin technique. Unbeknowst to Baen, however, others were also participating in the exact same training that he was. This would create an interesting dynamic between himself and his constituents.

"He wasn't supposed to lose...Before.." 

Despite his usual asshole demeanor, Baen had feelings and they were official hurt. He almost felt like if he were there he could of made a difference, but he knew that he would of only been a burden upon the Mizukage. That's what hurt the most, honestly. He could feel the tears rising in the corner of his eyes, but he quickly wiped them away as he attempted to place his feelings in check, but he couldn't help but feel hollow. * - Fri Sep 18 13:33:26 2015
