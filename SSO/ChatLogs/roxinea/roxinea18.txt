<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked as she looked upon her teaher. This was quite the chore he had put forth for her. She would roll her shoulders as she visualised her intentions. She would run through some basic stuff first. She had to get back into her training mind set! Her arms and legs properly stretched she would jump forward onto her hands! 

Now on her hands she would begin to focus chakra through her body. This process was slow. She wanted to make sure she was getting each and every spot. The moment she finished, she cast the chakra away, a visable look of unhappiness crossing her face. She had to do it fast, or their was no point to all of this!

She would once more call upon her chakra, building it throughout her body at a faster pace. She could feel the warmth blossoming through her body in a rush of speed. She was getting better at summoning up her chakra, but not quite what she wanted. Hassan might notice she did not start right away. Her face a mask of concentraion. 

Once more she would cast off her chakra, before calling it all back in one solid mental command. This time it would work like a charm! Her whole body felt the warmth surround her in one fluid motion! A large smile crossing her face as she readied herself for the next step! 

The chakra now properly called upon, she would try for force all her chakra out at once. This worked partially as it caused her clothing to flutter slightly, but nothing much else. She had to remember what her leader had told her! She would cast off her chakra, and ready herself to start once more,

Her body was already startnig to feel the strain of her training! Her arms had a slight burn to them, Her breathing was still stable however. She would continue with her training. She would call upon her chakra to fill her body to the brim almost instantly. She would then throw it all out in one strong burst.  The tell tell Halo would form around her! 

She would now try to add in the next step of her training. The moment she tried to call upon her wind chakra, the concentration she had on the eralier amount of chakra would cease, causeing the chakra to fade. She would curse softly as she shook off her failure and started the process over once more. 

She would continue with her training regardless of the momentairy setback. She would call upon her chakra to fill her body to the brim almost instantly, this time calling upon her wind element as well. This process was diffrent, and made her feel flighty and light. 

She would then throw it all out in one strong burst. The process taking a moment longer then she would have liked, but in the end a massive burst of wind would explode off of her in a halo/ This ended up sending sand and dirt and loose rocks flying away from her in a rush! * - Thu Nov  5 08:08:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) stood upon her hands with the corona of wind around her. She would hear her Teachers word. Smileing she would begin to to make the impossibe possible. Her body would slowly begin to float off the ground! Her mind focused on the task on hand. Her goal of becomeing a strong shinobi, fuleing her desire to be the best!

She had heard her Sensei's words. He was eager to get started. He may actually be eager to get finished! He had alot of work he had to do after all. Though at the same time, she knew how much he hated the mind numbing work that waited for him in his office. 

She would float off the ground, hands extended out infront of her as she momentaily forgot the feeling of tirdeness in her body. She was sore and tired and a little frustrated. She had to work that opinion out of herself through her training! Her focus was now one hundred percent on her training. It would show as she floated a little higher off the ground! 

She mantaind this floating postion, clearly trying to impress her teacher! She was enjoying the rush she was getting with having this much wind surrounding her, as it was the element she responded to the best. Though at the same time, she could already feel her body trying to rebell.

Her body was starting to run down as she held the postion above the sand. The wind being mantained at a cost. Sweat was begining to pour off of her body. Her arms and legs were really begining to complain as the sourness began to build up. She was about art her limit and she knew it!

She would feel her limit fast approaching, but choose to end the training on her own terms, instead of falling flat like last time. She would lower her chakra, allowing herself to land upon her hands, then pushed off the ground to land upon the sand with her feet, Though she was very light headed, and stumbled a little bit. Though almost loseing her balance, she managed to stay on her feet and look upon her leader with a small smile. * - Thu Nov  5 08:30:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled as several things all happened at once. Her new motto would have to be "KEep them guessing" As her clone, seemingly needed to defend agasint Katsune would instead make itself usefull in this spar! A pair of hand would erupt out of the ground as Ziare knelt down to form his hand sign, and down he would go! Dragged into the dirt up to his neck! 

The real Marrisa would dart off towars the center, alongside both the boy and girl. She witnessed the girl form a handsign she had never seen before, whice brough a look of confusion from the jounin, but none the less was noted. She would, her sharingan active, keep in mind of the formation of the hand seal and the way her body seemed to slump over even as she herself suddenly veered to the left, aiming to avoif whatever may have been aimed at her! forming five handsigns in rapid time! * - Thu Nov  5 10:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: u. - Thu Nov  5 10:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) was in mid movement as the intended shadow tried to ensnare her. It would come down to her speed Vs the jutsu speed! She aimed to avoid whatever was being cast at her, and His jutsu aimed to keep her in place while she was unaware, it would come down to FATE! The earth clone under the ground would begin to form handsigns!* - Thu Nov  5 10:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: blob* - Thu Nov  5 11:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It just stops and u get conscience back - Thu Nov  5 11:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Many factors are taken into consideration. Mind Transfer is best affective when used on a binded/stationary person. It is more of a conscious thing I suppose. There won't be any rebound where someone gets hit unless the person steps in front of the initial path. As far as it being controllable, you can't arch it after ur activated the jutsu, but when aiming TO launch it, you can add that 'arch' or 'slant'. -) - Thu Nov  5 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says:  but when aiming TO launch it, you can add that 'arch' or 'slant'. - - Thu Nov  5 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) was not sure what the fuck was going on in this spar. But as she was in midmotion, not having seen the incoming tindrils of shadow. She would be caught, but only for a moment! In the moment of being frozen a plume of white smoke would erupt around her and she was now Neck deep in the dirt, where as Ziare would find himself in the spot she had stood before! This was the jutsu she had prepared before! 

The clone would remain under ground, Waiting for the right moment to do anything! 

The mind would coninue either on it's way to it's own body, or Right SMACK into Ziare!* - Thu Nov  5 11:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: if it is conscience i assume i still take control - Thu Nov  5 11:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) // The Clone Marris would move into action the moment that the real marrisa was captured! The real Marrisa would suddenly vanish under the ground completley! Likely freed of the hold of the possion jutsu as the hole that would have been there was closed without a trace upon her submergeing. 

Should that be the case, She would move under the ground, in tandem with her clone. Something was being planned!* - Thu Nov  5 11:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: this is good im learning  - Thu Nov  5 12:05:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: She may try to come from under us with her and her clone. - Thu Nov  5 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Stay focused. - Thu Nov  5 12:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) popped out of the ground and regarded both ot these children. Sure, if she were not holding back, she could have killed them both a few times over, but wow. . The potentioal here was amazing. So much so, that she was gonna let Ziare off the hook. 

"Okay. . You both get a free PAss. . The next time I come to Konoha. . I'll teach you a Genjutsu or something Rias. . And Ziare. . Keep training. . IF you manage to impress me the next time I see you, I'll give you a prize."

That said she would raise all the way out of the ground, and walk over to Ortho, a soft look of distate in her eyes as she spotted the bottle, but it quickly passed.

"Hello Ortho."

She said, lighting up one of her blunts, while turning off her Sharingan.* - Thu Nov  5 12:11:44 2015

"Give them to Ria"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) felt her face burn with emberesemt. Sex seemes to be the common insult of the day, and it was starting to bug the shit out of her. She remained cool headed and calm, just as Hassan had taught her. Her body language spoke nothing of the rage she was now feeling. 

"You can threaten me all you want. I will not be swayed by this. If this really was assisted suicuide, she can come in and submit to interragation. It would be harmless and solve -ALL- of these issues. On that note, I have a personal series of questions for you. How is it suicide when he attempted to run for his life? How is suicide when he made sure the sage survived and the sage reported his attempt to flee? In my opinon, You're full of bullshit, Index. You and your slut of a girlfriend. "

She paused and then continued.

"And on the point of sluts. Your earlier comment holds no swa to me. I have never lain with a man, nor "put a dick around my lips" as you so colorfully stated. Seems to me, the only one who has gone pussy blind is you."* - Thu Nov  5 20:26:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) remained Stoic. She regarded Index with a look of regret. She had never wanted to lose friends. She actually had a great amount of respect for him. She respected anyone who could survive and climb in the ranks of ther Gezo. His postion as a Sargent alone made him her obvious superiour. She was not being combatitive, her body remained tense and reactive, but not in an aggressive manner. She would speak now, to fully address this situation.

"Our gaurds are ordered to aprehend, not attack. If you were attacked, I will speak to the guards myself. You and Katsune are only wanted for questioning. This was Lord Hassan's will. Yan would like to say otherwise, but he is not the Kazekage. Should you and Katsune agree to proper questioning, I can promise you safe passge into Sunagaure."

She would regard Ortho now. She would nod to him, actual heartbreak crossing her face. 

"I will -NEVER- Raise my hand to you. . "
