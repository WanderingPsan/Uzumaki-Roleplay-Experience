<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) says: Iwagakure no Sato. - Sat Oct 31 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) nods and feeds chakra into her eyes. The usual black vanishing to blood red, with two black tome upon their surface, hiddden behind the goggles she currenlty wore, she would bring herself into a netural postion and prepare herself.* - Sat Oct 31 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the man enter, and waited for the go ahead before she began. She would quickly clap her hands, Sending forth a blast of super compressed air at a shocking volicty toward the man called Sojiro. She herself would begin to move to the left at a rapid pace, after fireing off the jutsu, aiming to move in a circle. * - Sat Oct 31 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the man sore. Her eyes giveing her a brief look into what he was planning to do, and acted upon it. Should she have the time to do so. She would suddenly alight with flames that floated off of her body, and aim to counter the strike as it came to her. Should things go as she hoped, she would bring her right hand up in a sudden and quick motion, with the intent to knock the incoming fist away, and hopefully gain a momentairy advantage.* - Sat Oct 31 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) thinks: I can't lose---for the honor of my village. - Sat Oct 31 17:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt a shiver run through her body. This was not going to be her end. Not by a long shot. She felt the hatred that drove her to find new power burning deep within her. Her desire to overpower all and meet her goal a constent sore thorn in her side. She would not just sit and take his punches. With a sudden burst of speed she would Throw herself down and to the right, aiming to avoid the incoming kick all together.  While forming a quick burst of handsign(s?) to cast a jutsu forward toward Soujiro! 

Should all go well, The world around Soujiro would not change, but above him a large meteor would be coming down from the sky. IT's heat massive and intense. It was coming stright for the shinobi!* - Sat Oct 31 17:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) thinks: It's only her first match. - Sat Oct 31 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) thinks: Usually people handle their opponent quickly. - Sat Oct 31 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) knew she was not going to get the change to finishe her jutsu, so instead she brought both hands hands back at a rapid pace. Willing the fire around her to intensify. Her goal was to burn the man considerably once more for attempting to get his hand to close to her. Should he grab onto her wrist in the time she would attempt to do so, the same result would happen. Calling upon her ability to manipulate the fire. 

Should she suceed in burning the man and gaining her freedom, and a moment's escape, she would clap, Sending forth another close range burst of air aimed to slam into the man's well toned stomach and send him careening away.* - Sat Oct 31 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) screamed in pain, and did the only senseable thing as she flet her body about to be snaped like a twig. She  screamed and pushed her chakra through her body as the shroud flared once more, only this time aimed to burn not only his hand and arm, but the man's eyes as well. He was holding her in the air after all. 

Should this plan work, for even a moment. She woudl attempt to Squirm free of the man's iron grasp, banking on the now slick boody and wounded hand to allow her freedom.  She had no idea what she was doing. Her mind raceing to try and find a way out of this situation. * - Sat Oct 31 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) landed upon her feet, jumped back and in one swift motion pulled the fan from her back and swing it open and wide in one swift well practiced motion. She would focus her chakra forward and let a burst of wind, Already lighting ablaze thanks to her Fire shroud, rush forward at amamazing speeds, while the man Sojirou took the moment to save his eyes. Her harted boiling over. * - Sat Oct 31 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) thinks: Fight...till the very end! - Sat Oct 31 18:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the kick coming and threw herself to the leaft as fast as she could, provided she was able to dodge said kick, praying the damage her jutsu had done would have slowed him down. Should this go without issue the fan would be swung again, only this time, It was meant to blow the man away as he was still in the air! This two would be infused with fire, unless the nature of the jutsu was enough to cancle out fhe Fire shroud's influance!* - Sat Oct 31 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) thinks: Guh. - Sat Oct 31 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) thinks: I need to finish her off while she's weakened. - Sat Oct 31 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) thinks: Gah... - Sat Oct 31 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) swung her fan once more. The hatred in her eyes was unmistakeble now. She would launch another wall of super heated bladed wind, Banking on the area of effect that came with the use of the jutsu and the fan. She would not let up, though a small part of her, really didn;t wan't to kill this man, she knew she would have to!* - Sat Oct 31 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) says: Next. - Sat Oct 31 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) says: Come. - Sat Oct 31 18:11:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Aye - Sat Oct 31 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) wasted apsolutly no time in her attack. Even as he walked into the arena she swung her fan. An angry yell in her voice as once more a wall of super heated bladed wind flew forward. She was in no way holding back after the ordeal she had just been through with Soujiro.  This jutsu would rush acorss the field at a rapid pace, with apsolutly no remorse for the man who she had wanted to see gorw to be a strong shinobi. Her anger clouding her judgement.* - Sat Oct 31 18:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the boy collapse onto the ground, She would start to walk forward slowly,allowing the fire shroud to fade while holding the fan above her head, and swinging it once, Sending out a wall of blunt wind to slam him into the wall, then takeing a breather, She hoped to regain a little bit of chakra and stamina while he suffered from whatever damage she might have caused.* - Sat Oct 31 18:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sighed and popped a healing pill into her mouth before crunching down upon it. She was going to need the healing power. She would run full speed south and then west, aiming to swing her fan the moment she saw her one time student. She would unleash another burst of bladed wind. Her goal, to kill him quickly so he didn't have to feel any more pain!* - Sat Oct 31 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinks and rushes forward. She was notuin the mood for games. The Proctor didn't annouce the end of the match, this it wasn't over. She would fling a Kuni with a tag right at the boys feet the moment she was in a safe range to do so. He had just taked a KAzekiri. . She doubted very much he would have much use of any part of his body, she remained tense and ready though. She would detonate the tag the moment it landed on or near the body.* - Sat Oct 31 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) says: Here's your next opponent Marrisa! - Sat Oct 31 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) says: He's a vagabond ninja from the Land of Rice. - Sat Oct 31 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) once more gives the man no breathing room, or room to figure out where he was. She would swing her fan with the aim to unleash a wall of bladed death down upon the man. She had a look of sacgery in her eyes. Mentally she willing the third tome to form upon her eye. Begging for the ture power the sharingan possesed!* - Sat Oct 31 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) bolted  to the right as fast as she could, Her sharingan giving her an edge once more with the helpd of the split second warning of what was to come. Her body igniting in fire once more! She was not sure, but a small part of her mind hoped that this new tactic would work. She would recevice some minror burns to her side, if she were not fast enough to dodge out of the way of the incoming ball of fire and her Fire shroud didn't mitigate any of the fire damage, 

She would swing her fan once more. This limp dick ight be Taku of the Wakufaku family, but she was Marrisa of the Ryu, she would not go down that eaisly! The same jutsu as before would be used now, aiming to hit a wideer range of attack this time. * - Sat Oct 31 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) knew the jutsu he was doing from the handsigns alone, provided she could keep up with them, and her sharingan was able to keep up. She woulld jump backwards, Hoping to escape the worst of the blast. Should this work, she would take whatever spill over damae and rush forward, putting all her speed into the upcoming attack. She would, the moment she closed the distance, swing her fan with all her might, sending forward another sickle weasle empowered with the fire that surrounded her body!* - Sat Oct 31 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was mid rush, She couldn't changre trjectory, but she could alter her intentions! As the man started expelling whatever it was he intended to expell, her flames woudl vanish as quickly as they had apppered. Shutting of their source of existince, her chakra, and then proceeding with her plan to swing her fan. She banked on her sharingan altering her a few moments before the man actually did release his gas, as that's what she assumed he was tryinng to release! 

This was of course, so long as the turning off of Fire shrouf worked like it had been explained to her. IF not, she likely was about to be in for a world of hurt.* - Sat Oct 31 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Threw her fan infront of her, as the explsion rocked around them, She hoped her durable body and the raw hatred that strummed off of her would enable her to survive. * - Sat Oct 31 19:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was covered in severe burns. She knew she wasn't going to survive this much longer. But she refused to give up. She was too close to her goal! She just needed more time. She would shut and sit up to look upon the man that was crawling towards her, and clap for him. One solid clap. The pain that came from the clap was surreal, causeing a scream to eminate from within her body, due to the fractured hand, but the result was what she hoped for. A blast of highly pressurised wind, aimed to slam right into the head of the Zeaolt, and hopefully end his religous campain! 

Should this work out, she would struggle to her damaged and burned feet. She was coming to a shocking realization. She was going to die here. No two ways about it. IF the next enemy was as touch as this one. She was doomed. * - Sat Oct 31 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Tough* - Sat Oct 31 20:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) says: Say hello to your next opponent. - Mon Nov  2 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) did her best to look upon her next opponent and, as quick as she could, formed up a series of three handsigns, Ignoreing the pain that came from the manipulation of her hand right now. She couldn't afford to give in to the pain yet. She had to continue to drive herself. She would quickly expell a series of bullet like blasts of wind. She was not fucking around anymore. She was willing to lose bits of her self to come ahead and continue to grow as a person!* - Mon Nov  2 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) wasn't fucking around. She would know the inoming quill thing was going to hurt. SHe would jump out of the way, her reflexes and movement lessened, but still intacked. She would hope that the finished jutsu would be enough to impact the man, as she continued the motions of her jutsu, aiming to continue to fire off the wind bullets with the intent to kill the man without to much hassle! * - Mon Nov  2 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) the even as the man tanked the first set of wind bullets, she would lunge to the right, cringeing from the pain in her abdomen. She would swing her fan with all her might as he aimed to come close to her once more. The jutsu would have a great amount of wind power, though it's real stregth came from the fact that it contained bladed pockets of Vaccume space. The intent of this jutsu was stop and lift the man, while cutting him to shreads, Provided the spines didn't leave him ancored to the ground. Her reliance upon the sharingan was starting to worry her!* - Mon Nov  2 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) wasn't sure how this freak was keeping up with her, even damaged as she was, she could tell he was wet behind the ears. She would likely about to be hurting, maybe even dead. She coulden't very well shift without landing. She felt her fan slam into the rolling man, Even stopped, the wind would still have managed to get to the middle of it's swing, and produce some kind of wind. She hoped at least. 

IF the wind was procuded, Whice with her Mastry of the fan and level of chakra and wind manipulation seemed likely but not certain, The same intention as before would be produced. A blast of highley powerfull condensed bladed wind would rush forward, aiming to blow the porcupine boy back and cut his skin. 

If the wind was not produced, she would feel her fan's edge make contact with the PRocupine man's ball. The force of whice would likely knock her backwards into the air, though her grip remained on the fan with her good hand. She would use this moment to fall upon her fan, manipulating the wind chakra she possesed, and hopefully fly/Glide a few extra tiles away and up into the air! If not, she she would likely tumble to the ground painfully, more cure and burses forming along her body. * - Mon Nov  2 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Stumbled back, letting the now broken fan free of her grasp, where it would fall to the ground as she threw forth a single purple ball to the momentairly stopped man, who very likely coulden't see her due to being in a ball. She had lost a good friend on this battle field. She would not forget him. She would, with a sudden shocking movement, Vanish into the ground at her feet, Sinking at a rapid pace into the very earth. She would aim to get distince as she plotted her next move. * - Mon Nov  2 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Rose from the underground a bit aways from Garukichi, having felt him collapse upon the ground. She was nearing her end. She didn't have much time left. She could feel her chakra supplies getting low, and her satmina was starting to wear on her. She would shake her head, prepareing for the next battle, shifting into a netural postion. Her arms already floating next to one another, She would form handsigns the moment she saw her next opponenet.* - Mon Nov  2 02:42:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the man form his handsign, watched the chakra within him surge forward. She knew this tactic, and this jutsu. It was one she herself emplyoed. Her sharingan gave her an obvious edge here! She would intentionlly twist the fractured wrist, allowing the massive shock of pain to right her system as break the genjutsu, before she rapidly sunk into the ground and out of sight, She would streak through the ground towards her opponent at an impressive speed!* - Mon Nov  2 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was no idiot. She knew the moment the man was no longer able to be sensed he had left the ground proper. However, The shift in the corpse's location was a dead giveaway, as she was using the earth to sense and not a chakra based system. She would raise beneath the body carefully, aiming to keep it reletivly undisturbed by only making the point where he hand would leave the safty of the ground maliable.Her goal was placeing three tags on the underside of the body, before allowinging herself to sink back into the ground deep, With the intention to destory the tags the moment she was out of distnce of the explosion.* - Mon Nov  2 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But as a -fiel commander-, that shit is a wise tactic. - Mon Nov  2 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was below the man within moments after he had landed upon the dirt. She would, moving at her full speed and ability, aim to grasp his legs and pull him Violently down into the dirt, in both hands an explosion tag aimed to be palced on either leg. Her intention, was to bury him up to his neck in the dirt, and leave him there, solidfied into the dirt, as the tegs finished him off rapidly. She would flee the blast zone remaining underground to protect herself from possiable Genjutsu.* - Mon Nov  2 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Rose out of the ground greatfully. She would look wobble slightly, but return to the ready postion. Her mind fuzzy from exaustion and her heart raceing. Tears fell freely down her face, though it held no saddness. Only rage, anger, and the desire to pass her test. Though the tears fell still, out of fear that she may never see her anger fullfilled.* - Mon Nov  2 03:43:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched as Yan performed his clone jutsu in a blur. She would sink into the ground in a sudden and quick fasion. Even as the cavern was formed around where she had been standing she would already be gone, moveing down and through the dirt like a mole. She had to relay on jutsu that had no handsigns, as she lacked both apendeges. She would aim to get beneath the real Yan in a burst of speed.

While under the dirt, her eyes filled with chakra. Her sharingan formed behind the portective tinted goggles, even if someone were to look at her eyes, they would see only the len's and not her actual occular ability.* - Tue Nov  3 04:24:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) came flying out of the ground, only she was feet first. She would aim to kick the real Yan right in the pelvc bone, useing her element of suprise to her advantage. She would aim, should everything go without issue, she would catch herself on the ground with her good hand, sending another kick to his stomach, and a third kick to his chest, in quick rapid secusession! Should all go as planned, she would finshe with a massiv heel drop onto his shoulder, She would be left vunrable after this attack, standing there on one hand!* - Tue Nov  3 04:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt a small acomplisment, untll the Yan she was attacking was replaced with another. This was a smart move. She was unable to get away in time, These dulled spikes moveing just a bit faster then her reflexes would allow her to dodge. She would be caught! She would laugh out loud and shake her head.

"You win Yan!"* - Tue Nov  3 04:58:14 2015

"Their methods are remorseless. They had me. . "

"Angetsu. . He challanged me in the Tournament. . It was kill or be killed. . I. . I now know why you hate the Gezo so much. . "* - Tue Nov  3 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked and looked at Orotho, her body language changing rapidly. She was first confused, Then worried, and finally Hurt. These emotions crossed her face in a rapid pace. She would look up at Ortho and try to make sense of what he had said. Her loyality to Sunagakure over him? Why. . Why would he ask her to choose?!

"You. . What?. . I lost my arm because I was ill prepared for my combat exam . .  You are not at fault Ortho."

She pasued as she glanced him over, and shook her head.

"What do you mean? Choose between my love for you and my village. . You are not asking me to betray Suna are you?"* - Tue Nov  3 05:54:33 2015

She watched his body and saw the raw emotion in her lovers eyes. She was moved he was finally opening up to her! She would start to smile and then stop. Her mind falling into a temporary chaos as she saw his tears and heard his words,

She then saw his sharingan, and her hopes and pride soared. She would extend her reamining hand across the table, offering her hand to him. She had remorse in her eyes, and fear. Her wo body was tense. She would finally speak.

"Then We shall work together to right it. . You and I will fix this system. . Together. . " 

She said. It was clear her intention was to be a spy on the inside of the Gezo. To learn more as she gained power. She already despised them for making her kill, espessicly her own student Angetsu. She had not been prepared for that, and his blood would forever stain her mind. Her body shook, accepting the fact she was what she was, and allowed her sharingan to return, locking eyes with Ortho.* - Tue Nov  3 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) looked upon Ortho. Her mind copletley shut down for a moment. He had just asked her to retire. Her mind was stuggling to comprehend this action, then her face turned hard. It was not the cold unfeeling kind of hard, but the insulted disbelieeing kind of hard. 

"I. . You want me to stop?! I am finally starting to become what I want to be as a person, and you tell me, Your love won't let me continue!? I CHOOSE this path! I knew the risks, just as much as you did when you became a shinobi! I will NOT be turned from my path! You can not expect me to just . Just. . SIT BACK and let YOU risk your life alone!?"
