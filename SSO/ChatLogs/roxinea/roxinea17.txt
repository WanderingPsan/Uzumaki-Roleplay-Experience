<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) formed a seried of handsigns, and would then place her hand upon Shin's head. Should this go undodged, Shin would find his world peeled away. He now floated in the center of a bubble, surrounded by a never ending series of Fileing cabnits. Marrisa floated nearby, outside of his little bubble. She would speak, and it would resound all around his mind as she began her interrogaion.

"Tell me what jutsu or ability you find is so pressing that KAtsune posseses that would require you to go alone. What do you plan to do with the Scroll. What is your intention with joining in with us. How do you feel about Katsune. How did you feel about Kilm."

each question was followed by a flare of pressure and chakra. Fileing cabinits, repersenting his memories and innermost thoughts, would shake as she struggled to open them and get the truthfull answers to each of her questions. Shin would be able to either answer truthfully, casueing each cabniet to open in one fluid motion, or Resist, causeing him minor pain and the drawer to remain stuck for now. If a seal was placed to prevent accses to the information, it would glow the color of the seal in question, but cause Shin no pain!* - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched as each fileing cabniet opened. Though one seemed to refrain from opening, but likely would not cause Shin any pain. She would mantain her hold upon the jutsu. She knew the prolonged effects of this jutsu, and knew it was harmless. Her face painted a picture of utter indiffrence to the whole affair. A far cange from her usual caring mentality.

"Once more. What jutsu or skill exactly makes you think she can sense trickery in receiving the scroll.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) started her training off on an akward note. This was good, as it quickly did her the goal of distracting herself from the issues in her personal life. She would look to her teacher and smile and try to do as he asked. After a moment of steady fosucing she found herself only out putting chakra through her feet. 

She would growl and disengage her chakra. Then her mind went into working mode. She would once more try to force chakra out of her varous pores. She would find herself unable to do so once more. The legs of her pants would flutter then stop. 

She calmed her mind as she cut off the flow of her chakra and started to flow it though her body once more. Though this time sand would fly out fromt beneath her. This caused her to take a spill and land butt first onto the warm sands of the land of wind. A look of irritation crossing her face. 

She was usually better at focusing her chakra through her body. She was smarter then this she knew she was. She would stand up and once more begin to focus her chakra through out her body. This time, her sleeves would flutter but that was it. A growing sign of irritation crossed her face once more.

She would begin again, calling upon her chakra, afer having it fade previously. She would then encourage it to spread throughout her body. For a brief moment it almost seemed like it was going to work, but then only her lower body from the Knees down to have it's clothing flutter, then fade. * - Wed Nov  4 07:22:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And release it all at once. - Wed Nov  4 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And keep it constant. - Wed Nov  4 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I should be able to see the chakra form a halo around your body. - Wed Nov  4 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If you arent exhausted, you aren't going hard enough. - Wed Nov  4 07:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) started open mouthed at Hassan for a moment. What he was asking her to do was nearly suicide. Releaseing massive amounts of chakra all at once with no purpose. She shook her head and her face returned to normal. She trusted Hassan, and therefore had no reason to doubt him now. 

She would keep her eyes open. She felt like her teacher prefered she had a proper vierw of the world around her while she trained. She would begin to call upon her chakra and gather it up in her body. She was not going to release it yet. She was preparing her upcoming attempts.

She would thrust her chakra outward, this time her whole lower body's worth of clothing would flutter . She would then try to focus her chakra harder, and in the process lost out on the chakra all togehter. This process was proving to be more trouble then she had thought it would be. 

She would inhale deeply, then begin focuseing on each and every point where her chakra could pour out of her body. She would focus on each point, encourageing chakra to pour out of them, like she was preping for Fire shroud. She would now seem to glow to a sensory's perception, while her clothing would all slowly flutter.

The process already began she would exhale and force her chakra out around her in large amounts. The result was astounding even to her. A burst of air and pressure from all around her, making a momentairy halo around the Kunoichi before it faded. sweat forming around her forehead and on the back of her neck. this training was increidably draining!* - Wed Nov  4 07:53:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Can you handle doing a handstand while completely still, while release a large portion of your chakra at the same time? - Wed Nov  4 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was going to act tought going to act tough for her Kage! She smiled and puffed out her chest, pretending not to be feeling the impact fomr the amount of chakra she was useing in this training. She would never admit to it, but aside from Fuji, Hassan was the only person she didn't think she could live with herself for dissapointing, so intsne was her loyality to Sunagakure. 

She would flip upon her handa and hold herself like that. After a few moments, she began to gather up her chakra. Letting it fill her body like a gourd of water is filled. Slowly and carefully as she prepared herself mentally for what was to come. 

She would then begin to push her chakra outwards. The chakra came easily this time, maybe because she had already figured out how this process worked better. Once more all the clothing on her body and her hair began to flutter as her chakra began escapeing. Then all at once, her chakra exploded outwards, reforming the Halo from before.

Marrisa quickly realised what HAssan had meant. She would hold herself up, expelling this chakra as her body rapidly weakened. She was bassicly pouring herself out onto the sand in rapid fashion, and it was an interesting feeling. She would look to Hassan, trying to gauge his expression. 

The porcess was to much after a little while. She felt her body tapping into that danger zone that said. "You can push it this far, but you'll pay for it" She suddenly cut off her chakra and with a suddenly dizzy spell overcoming her senses she would fall back into the dirt on her back!* - Wed Nov  4 08:12:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) stood there for a moment. Her mind in utter chaos. She was not sure what to think. Ortho had left her, one of her closer friends was now dead, Along with Suitengu, and here in the sands of sunagakure's training arena, was Hassan, trying to make her feel better. Telling her she was someone who held the potentoal to be strong. 

She noted the girl she had revently tried to help with her fighting walking into the area and had to quell the onset of emotions that had threatened to explode forward in that moment. She would inhale deeply and then exhale, wipeing a tear away from under her goggles, and then advanced forward to Hassan. * - Wed Nov  4 08:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiles softly, waveing to the Ramen shop owner. Who would wave back and ask her if she wanred her usual. She had been fond of this shop when she had lived her with Erebus and Katsune. She would looked around the area, trying to commit each new face to memory. 

Their was Ume, The girl with eyes as yellow as Topaz. This made Marrisa happy, bright eyes were always a good sign in a person. 

Her eyes made their way to Rias, who was focused on the counter, and as sch, all she could get to form an opinion was how jeaous she was of girls with hair a color other then black.

Thein their was Yonbu. She would look at the boy for a long moment. Sizeing him up. This boy didn't even have the look of a street smart thug, let alone trained shinobi. She wrotre him off as another Poser, and moved on.

Her optcs would fall upon Ziare. The look he gave her made her pause. She had seen a look similer to this the first time she had met the man who had made her rethink her life, and become the shinobi she was today. A gaze that said, Make me entertained fool. 

She would finally speak, once having assesed the situation. She would aim to address the building as a whole. This in it's self was a little out of her normal intentions, but Zeus was asleep, and she couldn't find Takedea. So she would find a way to distract herself!

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked at the girl and walked up, looking into her eyes. stareing into them for a moment before she sighed softly. 

"Look inside your self. . find the point where physical meets spirtual. . Hold onto it. . Let it fill you. . Then call it up to the paper. . The force you will be calling upon is called chakra, and it's one of the things that makes a Shinobi great."

Would look over at the blaze of fire from Ziare. This made her smile. She would be able to put the boy trough some paces after all!"* - Wed Nov  4 10:01:36 2015

"For the young lady. Earth and Water . For the Young man.. Fire. . You are both in luck! I can teach you a little bit about your elements as well as some basic Taijutsu! First however. . I am going to give you each a scroll on a very basic technique that can save your life in a pinch!"

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: She looks intimidating...I won't argue for now.. - Wed Nov  4 10:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) walked over and did her best to help the girl understand the scroll, Reading it aloud to her, or helping her spell out a word. She was a pretty decent Shinobi instructor.. but she was a terriable teacher teacher!* - Wed Nov  4 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled and nodded to Ziare.

"Yes. . but proper training of the mind or a matured dojutsu are required to realise you are in a Genjutsu . . So be aware. .Genjutsu are usually things that make you THINK you are forzem. Exerting the will to form the jutsu within the genjutsu, and sometimes, you can even fluctuare the chakra you posses as one is cast, to make it look as though you were effected when you were not, and I have never heard of that happening, but i supposed, the best line of advice is to ere on the side of caution."

She smield as his inquisitve mind! She knew there was a scholar within him! 

She would then give each of them scrolls, and left a Shadow clone with Ume to help teach her to read on her own as she went to rest agasint the fence.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll just disable your leg with my kunai! - Wed Nov  4 11:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Shifted her body, mid motion, and aimed to drop low, and grasp the kunai as it flew by her, flowing her own chakra into it to cause it to light ablze with fire. She would then look to Ziare, the Glowing Kunai in her hand. 

"You missed and gave me a weapon.  .That was smart. . "* - Wed Nov  4 11:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Damn I didn't think you would catch it... - Wed Nov  4 11:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) brought her fan out rapidly, swinging it only once, and produceing a sudden but strong wind that would send the two shuriken flying away harmlessly somewhere onto the battlefield.

"Really? Only going for my legs? And telling me you were going to do it?"* - Wed Nov  4 11:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Pain in the ass... - Wed Nov  4 11:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Had me confused XD  - Wed Nov  4 11:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the boy form a rather familure handsign. Her body tenseing up then relazing. She spotted the incoming Shadows, chooseing to accept being snared. She would regard the boy with renewed hope as she aimed to walk forward, embraceing her natural strength to simply break right out of the hold the jutsu would normally hold over those it insnared. Had she not been locked in this so often in the past, she likely would have been severly tripped up by it! * - Wed Nov  4 11:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) bolted forward suddenly and intentsly, aiming to grab the boys hands before he could even form his signs. She had stated she was moving towards him in her last action! Should this go without issue, she would press the Kunai he had thrown at her earlier to his neck, not with enough force to cut, but enough to make it's precense known, her voice suddenly gorwing dark, her aura cold. 

"And just like that. . You died. . "* - Wed Nov  4 11:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) dropped the boy and his Kunai. 

"So. . Read up. . and get your friend toegther. . I like training the younger generarion. . and I really want to see where you go in life. You use the same jutsu as my apprentive Mokotsu. . Though he died. . lrft me that jutsu you used on me though."* - Wed Nov  4 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: He shouldn't have. - Wed Nov  4 11:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: This jutsu has been passed down through our family. - Wed Nov  4 11:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It's not meant for anyone but us to know. - Wed Nov  4 11:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Well I have never taught another soul. .  - Wed Nov  4 11:42:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You're barely 4 years older than I am. - Wed Nov  4 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: even more reason you should be as strong as me. - Wed Nov  4 11:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) stared at Ortho for a moment, then rememeber what he had asked of her. She sighed, but did her best not to speak with him. It was breaknig her heart, but she would respect his desire to not talk with her. 

"Takedea. . I am here to report of a pair of rouges from the sand. Katsune and Index, are both wanted for questioning in the matter of the murder of Kilm. A reward of two million Ryo is on the head of Katsune. Further more, to harbor these criminals within your village -MAY- be considered an act of war."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) got into a taijutsu stance. She would see if he caught her intention. She planned to try and test his taijutsu first! She woudl rush forward at amazing speed, trying to throw a high kick aimed for his head, in hopes he would try to lower his center of gravity, that would be followed up by a savage lower kick aimed for his abdomen. * - Thu Nov  5 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt her kick miss, and when her foot was bought down, saw that he had managed to jump back. This would cause her intention to change! He was slipping tight into Ninjutsu, so she would have to do the same. She would, if time allowed between his movement, seal making, and fire spitting, sink into the ground at an alarming rate. Once below she would traverse to his postion quickly. * - Thu Nov  5 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Good job Ivel. . .you got her on the defensive. - Thu Nov  5 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: What now? - Thu Nov  5 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shot out of the ground suddenly from beneath him! Her foot preceeding the rest of her body in a full force kick aimed for his abdomen! 

"Dynamic entry!" 

She thought to herself. She aimed to suprise the boy, and land a solid kick to send him flying as she left the ground!* - Thu Nov  5 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Oooo wonder if she will teach me that kick? - Thu Nov  5 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: This nigga Ivel on point lol - Thu Nov  5 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) The moment her leg was graped. Her mind went into action. She was no slouch, and if he wanted to grab her, he would have to pay a price! Flame would erupt all about her body, as she aimed to bring her other foot to bear againt his jaw!  This was happening as the fire would be being created in Ivel's hands! Hopefully, the kick would land and disrupt his concentration, or force him to release her leg. 

If not, she would recevice the burns along her leg like a chump, grunting in pain, for as much as this hurt, having had her arm cut off and being burned during her exams had hurt much more! 

Should he have released her, she would land on her hands, and then push up into the air at a angle away from Ivel, aiming to backflip away from him a fair distance and land on her feet faceing him!* - Thu Nov  5 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Ivy over here is actually doing alright. . . You have my respect man. - Thu Nov  5 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) as he spoke to her, she would swing her fan, channleing her wind natured chakra into the fan as she did so! What would shoot forth was a wall of solid wind that would explode to life with fire! This technique didn't have the ability to kill, but if hit, would burn and knock back Ivel! * - Thu Nov  5 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Hm. - Thu Nov  5 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched him fly into the air to avoid her incoming blast. 

"That was a good move!"

She thought to herself. His ability to think, coupled with his obvious mastry of the fire element proved to her he would likely be able to take the test Fuji had put her through. Fucking eagles. She hated those things. She would take his free fall to swing her fan once more! This one aimed to intercept him as he fell through the air, as it was a bit of distnce to cross! The resulting jutsu would be a series of wind bullets, produced from her fan instead of her mouth due to her Mastry of the fan and knowladge of her element! 

She herself would attempt to put on a burst of speed, careful of her singed leg, to avoid him, should he manage to tank the blasrs and continue with operation, burn-a-bitch!* - Thu Nov  5 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sunk once more into the ground as he landed upon the dirt, the fire shroud shutting off instantly. She would move under the dirt now! Her next round, she was going to step it up as well!* - Thu Nov  5 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) formed a single handsign, and REALLY pushed her chakra! in a rush of Chakra and motion, twenty three new Marrisa's would spawn from the ground around Ivel! Seemingly forming up from the sand! They all lacked one key feature though, her fan. 

Each and every clone would rush him, from all angles! Each aiming to seemingly pummle the Genin!* - Thu Nov  5 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Damn Mari-Sensei, overkill much? - Thu Nov  5 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) / Twelve clones burst into piles of mud from the brutal attackl! They would form a layer of mud all over the battlefield. Eleven clones remained, and of them six would vanish from sight! Turning to mud as well! The remaining five would each form handsings and then cast the same jutsu! 

twenty spikes would shoot up from the ground where Ivel had landed! Each would normally be tipped with a razorsharp edge, but were blunted for this excersie. They would aim to pin Ivel in every possible way, restricking his mvements completley! t

The real Marrisa would stay below the ground, feeling for the outcome.* - Thu Nov  5 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: That damn jutsu. . . . trapped me like a fly in a spider web. - Thu Nov  5 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) //The clones would vanish now, Their jobs done! The spikes would remain, for the time being. 

The real Marrisa would strike now, coming up out of the earth to grab Ivel's ankles! The Spikes lessening their hold on him in tandem, leaveing a fraction of a second for reaction! Should all go as planned, Ivel would now be dragged into the dirt, up to the neck. Marrisa would surface out of the ground behind him. A smile upon her face. Ivel was going to be an amazing force of power for Sunagakure, should he prove to be as loyal to it as Herself, and Fuji were.* - Thu Nov  5 05:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) thinks: No! It's Dad! I was supposed to win! Now he'll hate me for life! I'm not strong like everyone else! He's gonna send me back to the rice fields! - Thu Nov  5 05:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Formed a series of handsigns, and influced the world around IVel! A circle of sand would flutter across his limited field of vison. MArrisa would seemingly begin walking away from the confined shinobi! It seems she accepted his desire to continue the spar! She would also wave to Fuji! She was clearly haveing a good time! * - Thu Nov  5 05:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) The genjutsu would fade, the world returning to normal as the earth would suddenly push Ivel out, one of the many clones she had formed moentairly reforming from the mud to do so, before dispereseing all togerher! She would finally cut her flow of chakra all together, allowing even the mud to vanish! * - Thu Nov  5 05:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You have an amazing skill with fire style . You should expand on it though. . Maybe pick up a sword like your father and sister. Your moves are well thought out, but are kind of easy to see through. Try to fight more subtly.  - Thu Nov  5 05:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) formed the Tiger handsign, Summoning forth Five Marria's out of purefire. Each would walk a healty distance away! 

The clones would form themselfs in an X pattern. With a Marrisa at the center and four MArria's around the edge. The four MArrisa's around the edge would form a series of rapid handsigns, and inhale deeply. After a few moments, they would each expell out a large cloud of green gas, that would center around the center Marrisa. Once the cloud was so dense you could barley see the Marrisa within, she would stap herself with a Kunai, causeing her to erupt in flames. 

The result would be a massive explosion! Rocking the ground around them and potentioally knocking both Hiroshi and Ivel off their feet, if unprepared. The real Marrisa braceing herself with Sumion.* - Thu Nov  5 05:34:56 2015
