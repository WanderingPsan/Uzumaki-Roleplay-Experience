<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Ahh. - Tue Sep 22 17:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Not untill I do a finale fitting - Tue Sep 22 17:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Here, Try These on. - Tue Sep 22 17:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: How do they fit? - Tue Sep 22 17:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Are they loose anywhere? Too Tight? - Tue Sep 22 17:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: T..Turn? - Tue Sep 22 17:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Also, I see nothing wrong with that. It just doesn't match my fighting style. - Tue Sep 22 17:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Correct, your turn. - Tue Sep 22 17:25:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) thinks: is this guy nuts? I am just doing a job. . Does he think I am some kind of harlot? - Tue Sep 22 17:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I. . I don't usually strip down for strangers sir. .As I said. . This was for your clothing. .Nothing more. . Give me a moment, and I'll make you a new outfit - Tue Sep 22 17:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Do either of these suit your Fancy? - Tue Sep 22 17:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm.. - Tue Sep 22 17:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Let me see if I have anything darker - Tue Sep 22 17:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: So.. Uhh.. You're not going to strip too? - Tue Sep 22 17:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am a Seamtreess and a ninja. . Not a prostitue sir. . - Tue Sep 22 17:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I wasn't suggesting that you were.. - Tue Sep 22 17:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Only fair seeing as though you don't have an official establishment for your customers. - Tue Sep 22 17:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I am in public half naked. - Tue Sep 22 17:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: And you are not. - Tue Sep 22 17:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sighed and opened her robe, not taking it off persay, but anyone who looked within would see her undergarments clearly visable. * - Tue Sep 22 17:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) remained nervous, She was a trained ninja after all, She caught the sublte movement forward. 

"Can I be frank and ask if your planning to Ravish me?. . I have remained a maiden this long, and I would like to keep it that way."

She stated calmly as she took a healty step back.* - Tue Sep 22 17:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Hmm. Yes, I'll surely by this. - Tue Sep 22 17:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt a blsuh cross her face. She bowed her head in apology and smiled. 

"The clothing is on the house! This time, Consider it an aplogy to you. . and if seduceing me is your goal, I welcome you to try but find it fair to warn you no man has suceeded before."* - Tue Sep 22 17:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blushed and fought the urge to run. She knew of this man, thus her earlier nervousness. She had always tried to remain netural for her part in the world and accepted the money without counting it. It was said to be rude to count money in front of people. She reletened to herself that life was likely about to get alot more complicated for her.

"I. . I guess I should travle with you for now then huh? I mean. . It will help me sell some clothing. . and. . Uhh. . Give you a better chance?"* - Tue Sep 22 17:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sighed softly, then gave a genuine smile to him. 

"My name is Marissa. . I am. . I am from the Uchiha Clan. . I am happy to travle with you. . To get to know the real you."

She said this without predujce. She realized that Rumors could start about anyone, and as Histoy dicated the sstory was ofen wirttem by the victor and sometimes the butt hurt loser. * - Tue Sep 22 18:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Besides. . I am no slouch in the fighting depeartment. . Even if I am only a Genin - Tue Sep 22 18:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Lesson one big boy, No one forces me to do anything. - Tue Sep 22 18:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am going to be the greatest Fan ninja of all time. If I didn't mean what I said, I would not have said it.  - Tue Sep 22 18:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) that having been said she retired her robe and adjusted her hair. 

"Your stuck with me now. I want to know you for you, not the rumors. It was wrong of me to assume everything I hear is factual."* - Tue Sep 22 18:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Honestly, I am usually much more tolorante then that! Anyway, Big guy. . Erebus. . Think you can help me to become a great shinobi?  - Tue Sep 22 18:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: My fighting style is rather unorthodox. - Tue Sep 22 18:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't use ninjutsu at all. - Tue Sep 22 18:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Damn. .  - Tue Sep 22 18:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: If you truly wish to venture with me, however, it'll be easier to progress forward.. - Tue Sep 22 18:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: As I said. I would not have said I plan to if I didn't - Tue Sep 22 18:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. When do you wish to head out? - Tue Sep 22 18:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Whenever. . I've been here for days with no one to talk to at all. .  - Tue Sep 22 18:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, we'll head out to Konohagakure right now. - Tue Sep 22 18:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll fund the caravan. - Tue Sep 22 18:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Alright. .  - Tue Sep 22 18:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Big village. .  - Tue Sep 22 19:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Stepped off the Caravan lightly, looking around. She was naturally nervous at the thought of being in a new village, but she was relaxed wirth Erebus near. * - Tue Sep 22 19:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Mostly everyone is asleep at this time. - Tue Sep 22 19:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What do you want to do in the mean time? - Tue Sep 22 19:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: . . .  - Tue Sep 22 19:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I want to train and get stronger I guess - Tue Sep 22 19:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Erebus. - Tue Sep 22 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Erebus? - Tue Sep 22 21:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Well, like I said.. I don't do ninjutsu.. - Tue Sep 22 23:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: How about we go for some sake..? - Tue Sep 22 23:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Sake sounds like alchohal. .  - Tue Sep 22 23:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It is. - Tue Sep 22 23:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Sounds good to me.  - Tue Sep 22 23:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Lead the way? I. .Don't exactly know my way around. - Tue Sep 22 23:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was not used to good food. . or eating a large amount of food in general. She looked over the food carefully then selcted a small bowl of Miso Ramen, some water, and some sake as well. She would begin to reach for her own money to pay.* - Wed Sep 23 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled softly and actually leaned into the supposidly savage killer of a man. She had to admit, if she was being decived, whice she didn't think she was, She didn't mind. It was nice not to have to scrounge for once in her life.

"Thanks. . I really mean that. . This is all so wonderful!"* - Wed Sep 23 00:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: No.. problem.. - Wed Sep 23 00:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You alright? - Wed Sep 23 00:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah, I am. - Wed Sep 23 00:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You seem. . Distracted? - Wed Sep 23 00:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: OH!  - Wed Sep 23 00:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: and two people came to the gate looking for you while you were napping - Wed Sep 23 00:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) describes Ushinawa and Mariana* - Wed Sep 23 00:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Ohh? - Wed Sep 23 00:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll be sure to get in contact with them shortly. - Wed Sep 23 00:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) nodded her head softly, shifting in her new clothing. She had felt it was time for a change! She began to eat and drink slowly, alternating between Sake and water.

"Who were they, if I may be so bold as to ask?"* - Wed Sep 23 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) nodded and continued to eat and then looked over at Erebus.

"Why do you want to Seduce me? and are you really in it for the long haul?"

She asked, no malice in her voice or tone, just genuine curiosity.* - Wed Sep 23 00:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) pursed her lips. The thought of a man only wanting her for her beauty was a little disheartening. She didn't hold it agasint him however, considering she was rarely called beautiful. She looked more into the second statement, her demenor changing slightly. 

"What do you hope to gain out of Seduceing me then, Erebus?"* - Wed Sep 23 01:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sat back, aving finished her bowl and was now sipping on her Sake as she mulled things over. 

"You realize. . I am a Virgin. . Who has fought very hard to mantain that? You'd have to try awfully hard to get much from me. Are you sure you can handle that?"

She had an almost teaseing hint to her voice, as if she were egging him on.* - Wed Sep 23 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) seemed to grow tense for a moment then laughed, a soft musical laugh that befited her size. She grinned at Erebus and shook her head, before speaking softly.

"Maybe big boy. . But not on the first date. Sorry."

She giggled.* - Wed Sep 23 01:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) laughed again, she let him have his moment of contact, she wasn't an ice queen, but she wasn't going to let him get much farther, Not becaue of who he was or anything, but becaue she simply wasn't ready for that kind of leap yet. She wanted a few days to really think about it before going much further. 

"Tell you what, I'll agree to this being the third date, and I'll kiss you, but no more, at least. . not right now. . I wanna get myself more accustom to what my life has become, is that alright?"* - Wed Sep 23 01:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) giggled again, She was letting him get away with a bit to much, but she was careful. Her own free hand snaked down to hold his, Stopping it from going any further as she leaned in and kissed him full on the mouth without another word. She lingered for a few seconds before breaking contact and jumping up from her seat. 

"I think were done eating hot shot."* - Wed Sep 23 01:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Of course! I'll get aquinted with my new home. . Maybe try to find a place to setup shop! - Wed Sep 23 01:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt his hand upon her behind but choose not to comment on it. The man was still a man after all, and she could understand his need in theory. Wanting something like that and knowing you could take it likely at any moment and not doing so must be a real chore. She nodded to him as she dusted herself off.

"Of course! I am going to run around the village and get to know my new home. I'll look for you later, you can help me pick a spot for my future store."

She said, a subtle inviation to see her again, should he take her up on the offer.* - Wed Sep 23 01:59:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anyone else up for a sparring session as a test? - Wed Sep 23 14:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: I'm not new so I don't care. - Wed Sep 23 14:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Huh . . . Guess not. - Wed Sep 23 14:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll be testing you then. - Wed Sep 23 14:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Follow me. - Wed Sep 23 14:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: As you say. - Wed Sep 23 14:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Erebus, gonna come watch? - Wed Sep 23 14:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: He'll catch up if he want's to watch. - Wed Sep 23 14:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If he knows where we're going . . . - Wed Sep 23 14:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Here's good. - Wed Sep 23 14:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You may begin. - Wed Sep 23 14:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Shrugged off her fan and Then tossed away her travaling cloak. She didn't need it anymore. Her new battle suit was beneath. She would nod to her opponent, understanding his order to begin and and abrutbly changed her whole demenor. Her body tensed as she gripped her fan and she summoned her chakra.

With one fluid and graceful swing, as if she had been useing the fan as another appendage her whole life. What was produced however, Was not a simple burst of wind, but a wall of blunt wind, meant to knock her opponent back and perhaps even daze him, Though normally bladed, she had opted to keep her jutsu in check, this was a spar afterall.* - Wed Sep 23 14:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched as the man simply weathered her jutsu, without getting a single amount of damage from the concussive force of her blow! This made her nervous, as He spead through his hand signs the girl performed another wind style jutsu, by flicking her fan as with all her wind jutsu, only this was pointed at the ground, with the aim to propell her high into air. She was not sure if she would be able to do so, given the appernt super speed of the lethal jutsu sent toward her Genin body. * - Wed Sep 23 15:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Wasn't sure what this man was trying to prove or pull, Her legs burned painfully as the the fabric of her clothing fluttred away in burnt clumps. She was lucky to have mantained useage of her legs. But no matter in the air she had control of her element. Though he mighrt be able to produce fireballs and throw them, with some inhuman type of speed, She would be able to avoid them just as easily. That was the pay off for being able to fly and manuver in the air. She did just that, Pushing wind where she needed too through her fan to avoid the incoming fireballs, whice she assumed were not thrown with a high level marksmen's aim.

She would continue to gain hight this whole time, hoping to quickly leave his area of effect. Anyone crazy enough to burn a Genin in a spar was not someone she wanted to fuck around with. She was already rapidly changing her mind about living in this village, or even selling her clothing to it. It dosen't take much to form a first impression, but gods above would this one stick.* - Wed Sep 23 15:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So how's the spar going? - Wed Sep 23 15:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Definitely shouldn't have used fire jutsu . . . Mhm . . . I should've used lightning . . . Wind is strong against lightning . . . Still . . . I don't think she would've won against my lightning even if she's a wind user . . . Damn. - Wed Sep 23 15:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the man from her perch on her, She couldn't hear a damn thing he said though, The pain of being high in the air is the sound of wind starts to drown out everything else. She assumed he was calling her back into the spar zone, and so she stopped climbing into the air right above him, Falling through the sky she began to swing her fan, once, twice, thrice, and finally a fourth time. Each swing of her fan as she fell created a build up of wind that began to flow forward, the force carrying a large source of force. He could weather one with some difficutly, but how would he do against four in one? 

The wall of concussive force would shoot down toward the opponent she was now right above, an impressive area of effect due to the mutiple use's of the jutsu, or so she could hope, Regardless, she would slip back upon her fan at thee last second, glideing back down to rest in one of the trees neat her origanle starting postion. Her legs throbbed painfully, luckly, she has thought ahead and ate the only healing pill she had, hoping to stem the pain and prevent perment tissue damage.* - Wed Sep 23 15:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) is so fucking done now. No, Like litterally. She is forfitting. She throws down a white bit of fabric. She had no business fighting a man who could quite litterly tank whatever she threw at him all day and never once get a single bit of damage to him. * - Wed Sep 23 15:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I may have overdone it when I trained my body. - Wed Sep 23 15:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) remained silent in her tree, Tending to her wounds as best she could with basic first aid training. (not perked) IT was clear she was in a sour mood for having been so foolish as to think she stood a chance.* - Wed Sep 23 15:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You're still not bad. Will definitely need to put you in a squad when we get around to making some. - Wed Sep 23 15:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I've already recovered from the S rank mission . . . I'm feeling good. - Wed Sep 23 15:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Erebus, If you have any tomorrow . . . I'll be glad to do another one. - Wed Sep 23 15:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: We really need Zenaki . . . She's a good medic. - Wed Sep 23 15:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Marrisa, let me know when you're done patching yourself up. - Wed Sep 23 15:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sorry about your wounds. - Wed Sep 23 15:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll keep you updated, Kilm. - Wed Sep 23 15:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Wed Sep 23 15:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: This magazine is freaky. - Wed Sep 23 15:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: . . . . - Wed Sep 23 15:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Climbs slowly out of the tree, careful on her legs, and puts her cloak back on. She seemed perfectly calm, cool, and collected. She would walk over to Erebus. 

"What's up?"

She asked with a chipper tune that was like her. She seemed no worse for the wear, though every so often her legs trembled. She was not sure how badly she had been injured, but had been gald to have a healing pill on her.* - Wed Sep 23 15:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Can I have a misson? - Thu Sep 24 00:32:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am sorry to keep you - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Although it is important, it's not something I will stop you from tending to your ninja for. - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll get back to you. I don't have time to pick a great mission for you and the last time I rushed that, I regretted it. - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: thank you, but you go ahead. I am sorry to have interupted. - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: Why.. is she here. - Wed Sep 30 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh, you're here. - Wed Sep 30 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: And you're here. - Wed Sep 30 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) walks in slowly, spotting Erebus and nodding* - Wed Sep 30 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Not by choice. - Wed Sep 30 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I see, then. That makes sense. - Wed Sep 30 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Really does. - Wed Sep 30 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Erebus? - Wed Sep 30 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm? - Wed Sep 30 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Can I get a few missions? - Wed Sep 30 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: A few..? - Wed Sep 30 23:19:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Nnananaanananannaananannananananana Kenshinnn - Wed Sep 30 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I need to get some under my belt . . I figure if I take a few low ranks at a time I can complete them and turn them in in bulk. - Wed Sep 30 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tramerus(Simbasax) says: I to would like to partake in these missions. - Wed Sep 30 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) reads the scroll that had been tossed to her, then looks around for the person she was to show around.* - Wed Sep 30 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: .... - Wed Sep 30 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So.. - Wed Sep 30 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Is ushiwana here? - Wed Sep 30 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: She talks too much.. - Wed Sep 30 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) walks off* - Wed Sep 30 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: That still leaves Taiga, and Edge as the ones that I know of still. - Wed Sep 30 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So. - Wed Sep 30 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) tosses the mission scroll back to Erebus.* - Wed Sep 30 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) looked apogetic and bowed her head to Erebus. She would recline agasint the wall. She would wait for him to call upon her again. She wanted another mission, one of more importance. * - Wed Sep 30 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) reads the scroll and looks over the room and sighed. This was about to be a very bad day. The last time she had tried sparring another shinobi of higher rank then her, they had litterally walked through all of her jutsu. She turned to look to Erebus and spoke softly.

"Can you point me to a Chunin I could challange?" 

She asked respectfully. A small look of dissapointment on her face.* - Thu Oct  1 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: He's young, but considered a Chuunin. - Thu Oct  1 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Knock yourself out. - Thu Oct  1 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: .... - Thu Oct  1 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: .... - Thu Oct  1 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Soo. - Thu Oct  1 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Scuse me. . I have to challange you for a mission. - Thu Oct  1 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I suppose you can begin whenever you'd like, but I won't be easy on you. - Thu Oct  1 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sighed softly and brought her fan off her back and swung it suddenly in a wide arch. She did not hold back at all as well. She had learned that Konoha was not a very training friendly. The swinging of the fan, seemingly harmless to those not in the know, would produce a sudden and savage wall of wind aimed to fly toward Suitengu. * - Thu Oct  1 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched as her wind was apperntly overpowered by the fire once more. She sighed internally. She was really begining to hate that fact that everyone seemed to have fire jutsu strong enough to over power all of her techniques. She jumped to the right and swung her fan as she did, useing the burst of air to hopefully avoid the incoming fireball. Should she have avoided the blast she would hold up her hands in surrender to to Suitengu. 

"I can't fight you. You will be able to over power all of my jutsu. I am sorry for wasting your time." 

She said simply.* - Thu Oct  1 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) didn't really waste any time once she saw the threads begin to erupt from the boys body. She jumped backwards and swung her fan hard, Sending out several blades of wind from her fan, useing it both as a method to put more distance between them and a method of attack. If sucsessfull it would hopfully cut some of the threads, or halt their forward progression.* - Thu Oct  1 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the man's threads take the blow and begin to recover. She didn't wait around for the man to make a counter attack, quickly aiming to swing her own fan at the ground that would cause a blast of wind to shoot her high into the air, hopefully avoiding the icoming threads. Should this go off without hindrence, she would end up floating on her fan in the air, gaining altidue and trying to avoid the incoming threads.

If not of course she would be bound by the threads, nothing she could do to avoid that. * - Thu Oct  1 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was focused on her assent, Not looking down toward her opponent as of yet. She would not refocus on her opponent untill she was out of the range of a fire jutsu, or what she thought was a safe distance. She would hover above the young boy and then flip over dropping like a rock and swinging her fan three times, sending out several blasts of bladed wind towards Suitengu one after another. 

This was a risky venture, as if he was able to simply tank this blow like the last opponent she would find herself unable to damage him in anyway with any of her jutsu. She would be prepared to shift her self if she needed to. * - Thu Oct  1 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) could not help but be amazed at the amount of damage she had delt ontop of the damage he has simply shrugged off. She realinged herself onto her fan and floated over towards the field of battled, south of the first tree near her. She would looked at the boy in a confused manner and then called out. 

"A. . Are we done? Do you want to keep going?" 

She was clearly upset over what she had seen. This boy was not normal in even the slighest sense of the word. She was tense and scared, weary of another attack from the man's unique ability.* - Thu Oct  1 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) walks in and waits for a moment before turning in her scroll softly and carefully. Being respectful to Erebus as she did so. * - Thu Oct  1 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Thu Oct  1 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Soo. - Thu Oct  1 02:13:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sighed, having been ignored, she would swing her fan suddenly toward the east fence, focuseing her inner chakra into the weapon she wore and then allowing it to be expelled outward in the form of three bullet shaped projectyles of wind. She was not nearly as adept at this jutsu as her various other master jutsu. 

The three orbs would fling themselfs at amazing speeds towards the Fence then punch right through the chainlink, Slamming into the bark of the tree further on and leaveing three indents on the bark, as if three small cannon balls had impacted there.* - Thu Oct  1 06:56:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) stood and patted her bottom off as she began fishing in her pouch attached to her left hip. She would smile to the brute and speak as she located the source of her serching. 

"I am Marrisa. I am going to be the greatest fan user some day, at least that's what I am training to become. Here, You should have this, it'll help you train and feel better."

She finished, tossing him the healing pill. She knew first hand how useful this pill could be, and at the very least it would keep him from passing out.* - Thu Oct  1 07:45:04 2015

She was trying to put missions under her belt so that she could gain notieraity and accses to better Wind jutsu. She had learned everything she could learn on her own for now. She half hugged Erebus and then stepped back. 

"When can I take another B rank mission? OR even an A rank if I get some help?" 

She asked, it was clear a fire was burning in her belly. She longed to be strong enough to make a diffrence.* - Thu Oct  1 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blushed at the forwardness of Erebus. He was always like that and she had come to take it in stride. She stepped back and giggled lightly. Shaking her head to clear it of distractions she kept at her goal of imporvement. 

"Then I'd Like a B or A rank mission Please."

She finally managed to mumble out. She turned and smiled, waving at Suitengu, Though she was not sure why, she held a fondness for him already. Nothing Romantic, more of a sisterly fondness or that of a close friend if anything. * - Thu Oct  1 20:13:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Tempted to test that myself, but laziness is a hell of a drug. - Thu Oct  1 21:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) walks forward, stopping right on the hidden trap. 

"Sorry about the wait, we can begin when you are ready."* - Thu Oct  1 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) noticed this happening rather quickly. She jumped backwards, hindered by the mud, and swung her fan as fast and as hard as she could. Her intention was to fire off her Wind bullet technique into the mud and at the beast's as they formed. It was highly unlikely she would escape all damage, but she might be able to dispurse one or two of the creatues, unless she was fast enough to hit all of them.* - Thu Oct  1 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Didn't waste any time. Her mind was working on overtime as she smiled softly. She would swing her fan two more times, This time aimed at the ground and then forward. The result would create a whirlwind cyclone around her to defend her as a second cyclone would rush forward, Aiming to disperese the mud as well as cut up the direct attacking hound on it's way towards Suitengu.* - Thu Oct  1 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was actually enjoying herself now. She would inhaled deeply and swing her fan down towards the ground once more, Sending a burst of wind to her feet to send her flying upwards, and away from the persistent canine creations. She was at a loss for how to defeat this jutsu, so she would avoid it it for the time being. If able that is. 

Should this all go off without a hitch, she would cimb into the air, looking around the battle field and coming up with a new battle plan.* - Thu Oct  1 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was airborn and wracking her mind for a way to go on the offensive and finally came up with a way. She flew up and then rolled from atop her fan, Throwing two Kunai with Exploding tags attached down toward her opponent, and then bangan swinging her fan three times. Each swing would send a burst of chakra filled wind down with the Kunai, Hopefully speeding them up past a dodgeable limit, but she was unsure, she had only recently came up with this tactic and it was her first implimentation of it. The wind jutsu was great breakthrough, Meant to pound into her opponent, dazeing them and leaveing them open for another attack, if she were lucky.* - Thu Oct  1 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: brb - Thu Oct  1 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Was rapidly ensnared by the unique jutsu. She didn't have a defense for this kind of attack. Her body froze, much to her own distain. She struggled to break free of the jutsu, exerting all of her chakra and will power if only to get back on her fan in time to glide to a safe landing instead of crashing to her death!* - Thu Oct  1 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) snapped into action the moment her body was hers to control again! She did not throw herself onto her fan, instead she swung it, hard, toward the ground, She was going to make one last attempt at saving herself AND damageing Suitengu. She was not normally this eager to prove herself to anyone, but something about this abnormally strong seven year old demanded she did only her best. The wall of bladed wind would do two things. 

One. Provide an Air coushin, Slowing her dencent and allowing her to land safely, reletive to the potentioal of the bed of sutures waiting for her.

Two. Injure and cut up her opponent a little more! She was not really holding back anymore, something she hoped was part of Suitengu's plan. 

She was relaying on her natural toughness and relfexes to weather the jarring landing that came with chooseing to land on her feet rather then to land safly with her fan! Would this ploy work? Only time would tell!* - Thu Oct  1 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) would like to say she landed gracefully, and quckly swung her fan to combate the canines as they came for her. That was not the case however, She landed upon the ground with a thud, lightly dazed from the drop and was quickly brought to the ground by the three way dog attack. She felt their jaws sink into her wrists, Biting back a scream of pain. She prayed this was blunt damaged and not lasting laceration damage. If she couldn't swing her fan anymore, her days as a shinobi were done. She made no move to fight off the dogs, her fear for her wrists to great. She would have to admit defeat here, as the pressure of the third dog reminded her she had lost.* - Thu Oct  1 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) got up slowly and rubbed her wrists, She quickly ate a healing pill and used some of her loose fabric to make makeshift banadges before walking over to Suitengu and offering him a new change of clothes. 

"I hope these fit. . "* - Thu Oct  1 23:00:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sat cross legged on the ground. An open scroll on Fire Style in her lap. She was reading up on the technique of Chakra flow. She knew the only way to imporve was to diversify her knowladge base. She had the look of a very focused indavidual.* - Fri Oct  2 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) yawned lightly. She was clearly worn out, as if she had been useing alot of chakra and staying up very late training and reading. She cracked her neck and stretched lightly as she continued to read.* - Fri Oct  2 12:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) heard the ninja approach, He was not masking his steps after all. She had turned to look upon him when the smell of alchohal hit her like a truck. She looked upon him and blinked sleep from her eyes. She rolled the scroll up and stood, Placeing it in her bag next to the other jutsu scrolls she had stored their. Her gaze fell back upon Erebus and she sighed. 

"Pressure finally getting to you? I've never seen you drink so much my friend."

She said softly, Having hoped his desire for her verginity had waned, though clearly it had not. She gave a friendly smile, completley at ease with the man now, her trust in him apsolute.* - Fri Oct  2 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sighed and shrugged. She was still not in the right mindset to give in to Erebus. She wanted to be able to stand on at least the same level as Suitengu before she gave herself to anyone, A girl had to have a goal in life afterall.She laughed softly and nodded. She made no attempt to stop Erebus from getting a handfull of her backside, she never had before and found no reason to start now.

"Sure, We can go into the Office."

She spoke softly, Turning to look at Shin as he approached from the south. She would wave slightly to him and then return her gaze to Erebus.* - Fri Oct  2 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: . . .  - Fri Oct  2 13:02:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) followed with a soft sigh and went to sit next to Erebus. She yawned soflty.* - Fri Oct  2 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shivered happily and reminded herself to be stern. She was not one to give up on her own ideals, Still Erebus seemed to have a fixation on her and he needed to relieve stress as much as the next ninja. She sighed and then began to speak. 

"I am slowly imporveing in my wind style, and I have even began to pick up some fire style jutsu, Though I lack the training to utilize it as of yet. I am hoping to take more missions, So I can imporve my Rank and standing." 

She said simply.* - Fri Oct  2 13:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sighed and shifted so that he could have his feel of her inner leg, but she place her hands defensivly on the upper points of her thighs. She was not going to let him get to far. She wasn't trying to be a tease or anything, She just wasn't ready to give up her V card, and not in a secret room in the Hokage's mansion. She had hopes for how it would happen. She spoke once more.

"I don't want you to give me Unique treatment. . " 

She almost whimpered. * - Fri Oct  2 13:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sighed, but kept her hands firm in their placement. She would not stop him from fondleing her breasts. She couldn't stop him without risking him gaining accses to her nether regions. She would smile happily. 

"I am happy to hear that. How long does it usually take to become a Chuinin Er- Erebus."

She asked, a slight catch in her breath coming from the new sensation of his hands upon parts of her body never before touched. She was thankful for the fabric that was secured with leather straps that kept her modesty intact.* - Fri Oct  2 13:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) half moaned half growled at Erebus. She recoiled slightly as she looked upon him. She had not been expecting the feeling of skin on skin and it made her suddenly nervous, like this was far more real then she was ready to admit. She looked slightly worried and suddenly nervous infront of Erebus for the first time in a great many months. 

"Well let me K. . Know what I have to do to show that. . "* - Fri Oct  2 13:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) pulled away once more, This time fuly as she brought her knees together and her arms up to cross her own chest. She had a look of hurt in her eyes as she stood. 

"I. . I think I am going to go to bed Erebus. . I still have that escort mission I have to do. . I need to rest up."* - Fri Oct  2 14:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) she sighed and sat on another coushin. She was confused, and tired. She looked up at Erebus and smiled to him, talking in a soft pleasent voice.

"What is it Erebus?"* - Fri Oct  2 14:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) paused and reclined back agasint the wall, her head resting agasint the cold plaster. She sighed softly and stretched, righting her clothing. 

"I am curious. . What attracts you to me so? Surely you must realize how homely and inferior I am to most of the other women in this village." 

* - Fri Oct  2 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) cocked her head and nodded as if she understood what he was saying, but the tone he was useing was making her more nervous then his earlier actions, but he was her friend, and she trusted him, so the nervousness quickly vanished.

"I am sorry. . I had not thought of it that way. Your right of course. Thank you for answering." 

She said with her usual tone and smile.* - Fri Oct  2 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) looked Erebus over then made a snap choice. 

"I'll give myself to you, in every way you want, once I have become a ninja who can fight on par with Suitengu, or become a proper Chunin. . Whice ever comes first."* - Fri Oct  2 14:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I don't wanna endanger the mansion or trees - Fri Oct  2 20:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled and stood with her fan already opened up to it's fullest extent. Three Uchiha creasts decorated it's surface, replaceing the usual moons. She smiled and bowed her head.

"You may begin when you are ready Miss Pink. I am Marrisa by the by." * - Fri Oct  2 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled softly and did something she normally never did to open up a fight, She performed a series of five handsigns, Then should would watch her opponent for their first attack. She was not going to be the first attack, or had she already started? Did she know Genjutsu perhaps?!* - Fri Oct  2 20:31:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) suddenly moved in a brisk fashion, heading in the direction she was floating away towards while avoiding the incoming paper, she held her open fan in one hand, and with her other threw a single Kunai towards her opponent, aimed for her chest, she was constently aware of her surroundings.* - Fri Oct  2 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kenkai(Gokuflash) says: Huh..A fight aye? - Fri Oct  2 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) let the chakram slam into her chest, taking a blunt blow as she erupted into smoke and then landed behind where the girl now floated. She had utilized the basic ninja technique of substatuion. Her suit of blue leather armor rested where she had been standing a few moments before. This complete Marrisa would swing her fan with a pointed focus of the floating mass of paper before her. A cyclone of bladed wind would form around her, aiming to tear apart the paper that Marrisa figured was the source of this jutsu. Unaware of how the manipulator worked, she fought without holding back, as she had been doing with Suitengu.* - Fri Oct  2 20:45:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the girl turn into a stream of papers, only helping Marrisa in the long run. She would swing her fan again, renewing the cyclone. She would smile, wondering how the girl would get out of being trapped in the ongoing cyclone. She was happy about her expanded chakra pool and advanced control. It was her real strength when fighting! * - Fri Oct  2 21:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) wasn't sure why she was trying to form anything out of her paper, but shrugged and swung her fan rapidly, banking on her reflexes and attack speed to be quicker then the formation of whatever Reisen was trying to make. Once more she would renew the cyclone, then provided this worked, wuld swing again, causeing a second burst of wind to speed up the cyclone, hoping to disoriente the manipulator inside.* - Fri Oct  2 21:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched his own jutsu clash with itself. What a shame, the girl was suddenly freed. She would throw herself into a side jump, avoiding the "Her" That was now a chakram, and swung her fan as she came out of the roll. Aiming to send another cyclone around the girl and her paper. She would be more careful this time, as it didn't serve a purpose to let her out. It was clear Marrisa was at an advantage here, or so she figured. She would keep on her toes, trusting in her trained reflexes and advanced eyesight to keep her up to date on Reisen's trickery.* - Fri Oct  2 21:57:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) wasn't sure how this girl thought she was auto getting around her body, but yea, that wasn't happening. She watched the paper move quickly towards her, but alas, her own reflexes, sight, and speed were better then the other Genin's. She would swing her fan down even as the attempt was made, sending a massive wall of wind outwards in all directions, easily blowing away the paper and propelling Marissa high into the air. With another swing, thanking her training for rapid swinging, she would propell herself backwards and away, while sending another wall of wind towards the mass of paper. These jutsu would noticably lack any blades, and be pure concussive force, pushing the papers away without injuring anyone. She would, should all go according to plan, land next to Erebus with a nod and place her fan on her back while responding to Erebus. 

"Yes sir."
