<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) nonchalantly looked upon Mizora, having seen her name and desrcripton in her bingo book she knew what to do. In what would only be descriped as a full intent to kill, Marrisa's eyes would blossom red behind her tinted goggles. Her hands would fly through three handsigns, and she would expell a massive number of marble sized blasts of air, all aimed to slam into, and then tear apart, the chest arms and legs of Mizora. A good cloud of them would be around her too. This jutsu didn't leave much room to dodge. Some may stray towards Yan, but she had not seen the caravan in time to warn him of her attempt upon the rouge!* - Sat Nov  7 08:17:55 2015

Her intention was to overpower the Rotation. A massice wall of wind would surge forward, simmiler to her SIckle weasle, but greating in power! Her focus reamined soley on Mizora. * - Sat Nov  7 08:36:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the girl survive her hit. Well that was mildly impressive. She would continue with with her inital plan. Whice simply put was attack. As the girl made handsigns, so did she. Three to be exact. Once more, She would fire off a series of bullets, Aimed to intercept her, aimed for her Chest, Torso, arms and finally legs. This would be in response of course, to her forming a water clone, not her clone forming handsigns. Her intention is to destory both the clone and injure her in the same motion.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) each bullet was stronger then the sickle weasle that had torn through the earlier Rotation, so the first bullet would do it's job on this one. The rest would continue on course. Aiming to slam into her person. THe altered location would mean the shots would not hurt a whole fucking lot, but if she was taken to a medic fast enough, she would live, if she were hit. 

IF she managed to avoid this barrage of pain, Marrisa would not remain stationary. Her body would move backwards, and her fan would once more be swung. Once more the chakra would surge through her body into her fan, but instead of bladed wind, a blunt cannon ball like source of wind would be produced, aimed to throw this bitch back away from her, not intending to let ger get close.* - Sat Nov  7 09:12:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) rolled her shoulders as she looked upon her leader, and at this point role model. She would smile. Her mind was focused on the task at hand as she prepared for the jutsu. She looked upon the hot desert sand and flexxed her arms. That finished she would throw herself forward onto her hands! 

She would land upon the sand with her hands holding her up with a soft earthy thud. Her body held alof with her feet sticking up into the air. Her body sagged down upon her arms, though by now she was well used to the weight of her own body. The fan upon her back weighed her down a little as well. She would smile even brighter as she felt good about today! 

Her body would begin to warm up as she ran through her usual steps to the jutsu! She mentally checked off each step before actually going through them for the finale practce. "Handstand, check. . Chakra. . Next. . Force. . Then. . " she went over in a mental movement. Her body was ready, and now so was her mind. She would intake a deep breath of the warm suna air and begin her process. 

She would call upon her chakra in one fell swoop. Her body filling to the brim alsmot instatly with chakra. She held that feeling for a moment before she expelled it all out in a rush. This would form the halo around her body as it usually did when she managed to make step one work without flaw. Then she would move onto the next step.

She would cast off her chakra just as quick as she had brought it on in the first place. Now she would once more call upon her chakra. This time her chakra would also meet with her natural wind element. The gathered chakra began to shake within her body, making her feel almost weightless. Now she was prepared to go onto the next step! 

Sweat was already forming upon her brow as she readied herself to go onto the next step. She calmed her breathing and steadied her body. Her focus was now one hundred percent upon herself. She had to hope she could trust in her leader watching her back if anything wonky happened. She was ready to go into the last sterp!

She pushed out her wind chakra all at once, letting it explode around her in a carona of wind. The rocks and dirt immidietly around her were pushed away in a show of the winds force. She always loved this feeling and the way it made her feel. Her body began to float a mere inch off the ground. She would then will herself hire, to show off her completed step. 

She would float upon the air, the wind surrouding her as she did so. She could feel her body adjusting to the jutsu now. Accepting it as part of something it could handle and perform. Her body was really taking to the jutsu in leaps and bounds. She would smile at her teacher. 

Now her body would flip around, making use of the air that surrounded her to manuver. She floated right side up and triumphently faced her teacher. Her arms slowly came to her sides. Her neck cracked as she shifted her body and tested a few movements. Her body shifted from side to side, moving with the speed afforded by the jutsu! 

She would come to float a few feet of the ground, as her soul soared with the joy of sucsess. She would push herself toward Hassan with a whoop of joy and happiness. 

"Lord Hassan! I have done it! Look!" 

She would do a few more laps before her body shook with the extended usage of her first go with the jutsu. She would bring herself to stop as she looked upon her KAzekage. With a satiisfied grin, she would land upon the dirt before him. A happy and positive aura surrounding her!* - Mon Nov  9 06:09:55 2015
