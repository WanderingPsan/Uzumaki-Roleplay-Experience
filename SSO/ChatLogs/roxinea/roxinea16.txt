<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And those are? - Wed Nov  4 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Katsune is way more skilled than I am, except in one area - Wed Nov  4 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Genjutsu. - Wed Nov  4 05:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I'm simply saying - Wed Nov  4 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: That I'll need time - Wed Nov  4 05:31:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: And my only request is - Wed Nov  4 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: That I can become a shinobi of this village - Wed Nov  4 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That's for Hassan to decide. He is to accept this operation either way. I think it's reasonablel. - Wed Nov  4 05:34:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Why is Marrisa here? - Wed Nov  4 05:38:46 2015
