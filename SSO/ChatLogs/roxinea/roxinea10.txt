Hew own anger at Saeza having been raped was leaking through the jutsu. Saeza could feel that Marrisa still cared for her, even though she had cpatured her. She was doing her duty as a shinobi. She mantained her connection still.

She would allow Fujitora to destory her and remake her, but would keep the ability to slowly give her back her skills as she became ready for them in her new life.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) looked upon the island, shaking her head in awe. She could not help but be amazed at the local. she would loosen her muscles softly and then look to the purple sky, she had always loved the color purple. She would then return her gaze to Fuji and wait for instruction.* - Sun Oct 25 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shruggd and walked slowly forward. Looking over the island with a small smile as she watched her teacher vanish into the island proper. She would adjust her fan and advance forward, looking over Iza and then over Nina. 

"Let go finishe this test huh?"* - Sun Oct 25 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) walked just behind the two. She was nervous, and unsure of what she was going to be doing on this ilsand. Izanami seemed to have some small idea of a direction to begin in, and so she would mantain the forward momentum, lagging only just sligtly behind her friends. * - Sun Oct 25 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) looked around noting the leaves and wild animals, She had continued walking forward, and without even meaning too, had seperated from the party of people walking with her. She looked around, moved to call out then stopped. Fuji had told her the best way to do the labyrinth would be alone. She continued to walk forward looking around and trying to find her way toward the center.* - Mon Oct 26 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) walking through the forest, she would not even that her path had been reversed. She would walk right into Nina? She was sure that her path had been clear a moment before! * - Mon Oct 26 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) walks a few feet forward. She had somehow lost the group already. She shrugged and continue walking forward. Her internal compass was all out of wack!* - Mon Oct 26 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) slid down the pit and was spit out like a rag doll into the air. She was no stranger to wind however. Her body snapping into action quickly. She was well trained for snap coices such as this. She would, withouth a moment notice as the massive falcons surrounded her. Fire would erupt around her body as she fell. 

Hoping that the fire caused the falcons to reconsder their actions, and why wouldn't it with the amount fo damage one would suffer if they tried to grasp upon her. (37) She would land upon her fan, quickly removed from her back, and would the launch herself higher into the air. Her goal? To make it back to solid ground and into the forest.* - Mon Oct 26 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) would hopfully have made it to the sold ground. She would then, without disspiating her Fire shroud, swing her fan, throwing a wave of vaccume pocketed air filled with blades. 

"GET AWAY!" 

She didn't like the thopught of dieing to birds.* - Mon Oct 26 01:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt the Falcon try to grasp her from behind. A burst of flame would concentrait upon that spot, Flames would shoot out from her aura and cover the Falcon. Then she would apperntly be granted a moment of peace. She would then throw her fan in a savage swing to produce a blunt savage gust of wind to throw any other wanna be falcons away from her. She would then fling herself into the water, Keeping the aura on long enough to produce a cloud of steam to mask her self, then would try to swim the FUCK away.* - Mon Oct 26 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was in the water with an irritating as FUCK falcon. She would take a kunai out of her pouch and flow her wind AND fire nature chakra through it and plunge that shit stright into it's flesh while she was dragged by the currents. Thankfull of her fan being on her holster. She would, hopefully, kill this thing while she floated along, taking whatever damage the bird can give.* - Mon Oct 26 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) clapped. thats right, she fucking clapped for the falcon. Sending a burst of highly powered wind right into it's feathery face! She ditched the fucking Kunai. She didn't care about it. She had one more. * - Mon Oct 26 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) rested for a small while.she floated along, allowing her chakra to restore.* - Mon Oct 26 02:05:00 2015

But only those born with this ember will glow just as bright.. - Mon Oct 26 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) pulled herself from the water and began her path back into the forest, rolling suddenly as she was knockec over. She would quickly raise from the ground.  She was unsure where she was but damn it she had a test to complete. Her body was sore but recovered. She was thankful for her durable frame. She felt the wounds that covered her body, minor as they were, they were numorus. 

She would shift her vison after pauseing to look for the source of the explosion. She could only hope to find her way towards the center as she spoke aloud.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) continued advancing forward, fan in hand. She would try diplomacy, after making it closer. * - Mon Oct 26 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm sure..... - Mon Oct 26 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) walked up slowly, then watched as the tribe cheered and surged forward, welcoming Marrisa like an old friend. She smiled softly, though she remained tense. She would let her fan rest back upon her back and advance forward, let by the tribe. She didn't let anyone touch her though. She would be respectful, but tense. She would bow to the man who looked like the leader.

"Greetings. . I am Ryuujin Marrisa. . An honor ro meet you."* - Mon Oct 26 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) looks over at the mountain. She was in a bad mood, after being attack, but her heroic nature took hold of her. She nodded to the chief. 

"Of course. I will. I will be happy to help. Can you give me all relevent information on this task? Then I will be on my way."

She said, her foul mood vanishing as she let her usual postive aura bleed into the area around her.* - Mon Oct 26 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) nodded and thanked the man, eating a small packed bowl of ramen, then she woudl rush forward, launching herself into the air with her fan and flying toward the mountain and it's amulet. She had no diesire to steal from the tribal people. She only wanted to prove her loyality to her Fuji. * - Mon Oct 26 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shivered as she once more activated the Fire Shroud technque. She would increase the output as she flew through the storm. Once she landed upon the frozen land. She would form a string of handsigns and then intook a breath of air then expell it forward. She would allow several bullets of fire to shoot forward, only to be followed by a swing of her fan, letting forth a burst of gale force winds to empower the fire technique and blow away any wolfs that might be getting. . *snicker* frosty* - Mon Oct 26 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: It seems we are doing good now. - Mon Oct 26 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was working overtime. Her body shivered, despite the flames of her shroud. She would redouble her fire, and dodge as she moved forward, bobbing between the incoming spikes of ice. She would form a series of handsigns before she would expell another breeze of flames, in a flamethorwer. She would then rapidly swing her fan once more, boosting the flames once more. She was not going to give up! She hoped this would be enough to get to the tablet, and hopefully destory it. She was determined to rid the poor villagers of this curse and do her teacher proud! * - Mon Oct 26 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) rushed forward, picking up the tablet, then swivled around, useing the shrouds fire as ammo for her next attack. She would swing with all her might, willing the fire around her body forward in a wave, to be captured by her fan's wind. Her intentions? To send a wave of fire forward to throw all the wolfs near her away. should this go without a hitch, she would try to take back to the air, to return to the village to let them know she had removed the dark tablet.* - Mon Oct 26 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt the maggots suddenly crawling upon her skin. She could feel their bites. She was about to lose her shit, when she realised what the voice had said. Their was a reason she had been training. She wanted to be the very best, like no one ever was. To surpass the last generation her test, to protect her village her cause. 

She would take a deep calming breath before she exacuted the Genjutsu Kai Technique. A burst of chakra travaled through her body at a rapid pace. She was attempting to break the Illusion by her force of mind alone.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) wasted no time. igniteing her self up in the fire shroud once more! This done she would swing her fan upwards, unleashing a burst of wind filled with blades. She was in NO fucking mood for more bugs. * - Mon Oct 26 04:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) goraned internally. She rushed forward and, still cloaked in her Fire Shroud, would clap her hands, aiming to send a jutsu stright at the falcon holding the villager. She had to save him. It would turn into a fireball that would light up the sky like a firework stright from it's mother land of Aisa! Her body shivered in fear. She would, if the blow was sucessfull she would catch the vilager, making sure the fires were willed to not hurt him, going so far as to turn them off if need be. Should this all go without fail, It was time to book it. She would run like a made women away from the angry Falcons, whice she just not decided was her least favortie bird ever!. * - Mon Oct 26 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt the wind grow, letting it blossom her Fire shroud, impowering it. She formed a series of handsigns. She took advantage of the owls increased area of vison and the newly lit up area around her. She would finish her signs. If all things went well? The owl would find itself below a huge ball of fire, so hot it's intensity could be felt from the sky way above their postion! The ball moved closer slowly , falling from the sky toward the huge ass owl. 

Marrisa would pull a Kunai from her pouch and waited to see what the outcome of her jutsu would create.* - Mon Oct 26 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) rushed forward, flowing wind through her kunai. The cutting power of the blade was now greatly increased! She would, if able, implae the owl right in it's owl face. Her Kunai likely also catching fire, seeing as how she was in shroud mode.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was on fire! She accepted their thanks verbaly. Not allowing anyone to touch her. not out of mistrust, but because ths forest got her all kinds of on edge. She would, reluctently, create a shadow clone to help the villagers on their way home, a waste of precious chakra, but one she had to do. She had a sense of heroism that just wouldn't quit!

This done, she would finally relax her shroud state as she walked where the tablet let her. weary and on edge the whole way!* - Mon Oct 26 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was overjoyed to see Nina! She would hug the smaller girl. Her body covered in various minor cuts and brusies. She would smile and ruffle the girls hair, before making camp for them all that night. She would rest for the night, treating all her own Wounds with the held of her Kage bunshin and her minor healing jutsu! this would be recirpcated to Iza and Nina before bed. * - Mon Oct 26 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) woke early, it seems nothing had pestered them throughout the night. This was a very bad sign. nothing was ever easy in this he- Forest. She would break camp around Iza and Nina, Leaveing their tent for them. She had done this alone so far, she was not sure she wanted to risk the dangers of whatever followed her due to her possesion of her tablet, on the others. So off she trotted, leaveing fresh supplies, aquired from the tribals with nina and Iza while they slept, and made her way toward the base, or cetner of the island alone. 

It was not our of greed of selfishness that she did this, but out of selflessness. * - Mon Oct 26 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Continues her walking. Tense and ready. She surveyed her surroundings like the kunoichi she was. Her path of self sacrafice. * - Mon Oct 26 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) looked upon the beast and took in a deep breath. She cracked her neck and allowed her fan off her back as she was envloped in the flames of her Fire shroud. She could not hope to best the beast with wind. . So her best bet would be to out burn the damn thing, if at all fucking possible. She would swing her fan, allowing the scikle weasle technique to take form, and become envloped in the flames of her shroud, then rush forward at amazinf speeds to crash into the monster. She did this with her primairy opening attack, testing the waters before she made her next play.* - Mon Oct 26 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) moved at a sudden and brake neack speed. Hopefully dodging the incoming wave of fire. She would. if able, form the Ram heandsign, and summon up. . a small army of clones! Five Marrisa's all at once would rush at the demon, trying to close the distance between them and it. The real Marrisa would continue moveing east ward.

Marrisa one through five would all run ahead like good little meatbags.* - Mon Oct 26 06:59:24 2015

Clones three four and five all dunked down then swung their fans at close range, each cloaked in fire from their Fire shrouds, they would all peform the sam technicuqe. A fire empowered scikle weasle technique aimed for his arms and legs! The clones would erupt after the jutsu was cast, sending smoke into the air everywhere.

AFTER the attack

The real Marrisa would form a series of handsigns. Casting another jutsu. altering this one's trigger to be smoke, as if from one of the clones explodeing, right in it's field of vison. If all went well. The Ifrit would find itself seeing it's worst fear, The Volcano off in the distance being suddenly extinquished by a massive orb of water, that would continue it's way towards their current location!* - Mon Oct 26 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) groans ineternally as the dazed beast threw another AOE of flame. Luckily it was away from herself, towards the clones that no longer existed. She would rush forward towards the dazed beast, aiming to get underneath it's massive frame. Her body still cloaked in the Fire shroud technique. She would hope this new plan would work better. 

She would swin her fan, provided she made it beneath the monster. right at it's unprotected underbelly. What would be produced would be a Sickle wealse impowered by the Fire shroud she wore. The beast wasn't frozen, so she had to assume it had not fallen victim to her Genjutsu.This was going to be a bad day for her. If she could not manage to land some kind of damage upon it soon, she was going to run out of tricks.* - Mon Oct 26 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) stayed quite as she threw three explodeing tages up at it's stomach. Then rushed out from underneath the beast. She would, once more, swung her fan. This time aiming her jutsu at it's side. Once more empowered by the fire shroud. Once she would swing the fan she would quickly form the Ram sign, igniteing the tags on it's soft underbody.* - Mon Oct 26 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) saw the beast gathering energy and instead of allowing it to blind her, she would close her eyes, hold her breath, and swing her fan down wards. Throwing up a wall of Ash into the air. This would lessen the impact of the Flash and possibly provide cover for the doomed Kunoichi. She would remain behind the beast. waiting for the brightness to fade before she opened her eyes, and threw another tag at the beast, attachted to a Kunai. She would clap moments after sending the kunai forth, aiming to empower the kunai several times in speed and damage capability.* - Mon Oct 26 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Rushed backwards, forming the ram sign to summon up two clones tthat would swing their fan's down towards the ground, throwing up another fresh wall of ash and causing a large updraft, and jumped onto her fan as the beast powered up it's sword. She would fly high into the air, useing the updraft to launch her even higher, getting clear of the AoE and giving her a bit of breathing room. She would take the Amulet into her hand and speak aloud, hopefully soft enough to prevent the beast from hearing her.

"What is it you wish to tell me. . I must acmplish my goal. . For my teacher's hopes ride upon me!"* - Mon Oct 26 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Mon Oct 26 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) it was time to bank it all on this! She trusted the amulet and what it said. She would focous this new burt of power into her wind element and dived down rapidly. She would begin to gather her chakra into her fan, though she did not use anything just yet. She was going to make this coming attack the greatest she had ever used before in her life. She would wait for it's attack, to make this truley god tier anime level* - Mon Oct 26 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt time slow for herself as she fell toward the beam. Her mind falling into a deep moment of Zen. She accept this moment as her possiable last. Her breath eased and her mind focused on the task at hand. Her body floated off the fan, letting it fall a few feet ahead of her. She would grasp the fan and feel the spirtual power running through it as she felt her whole being charged for the attack.

The fan fluttered into it's new temporary form and shape. The fan rippled and shifted. It's usual three purple moons shifting to the Uchiha clan crest. The usual tan background now pure black. The edges of the fan now Vibrent gold as it shone with spirtual splendor. The girl smiled and spoke aloud. " Awaken! oh fan of splendor! Cast down my enemies and show them my might!"

She would then focus upon her chakra, and with hope, activate the jutsu long dormant within her body.If the moment was right, her normally black irises would fade to blood red as however many tome she currently had accses to would blossom to life, if not, they would remain black. That settled she woulnd swing her fan, empowered by the spirtual bonus. Her body shook as she actually shouted out her attacks name. "Wind Style! Sickle weasle!" Then unleashed the super powered jutsu at the beam of fire coming forth at her. The intention, to consume the incoing fire and use it to empower her jutsu, to send the fire beast back to his own personal hell!

"FOR THE RYU!"* - Mon Oct 26 20:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) landed upon the ground with a thump, collapseing to her knees with a groan of pain as the fan flickered back to it's normal appernace and form.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) looked upon the door, She would place the fan up agasint the door and smile softly. She thought back to all of the trails of the island, and of all the words she had heard this accursed amulet had whispered to her. Only one word seemed to fit it all. She threw open her arms, looking upon the grand door, and then spoke aloud the word that resonated within her soul.

"Ambiance!"* - Mon Oct 26 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) almost laughed out loud as she plced her hands upon the door and said aloud.

"Ten Tickles, and look at it in a mirrior"* - Mon Oct 26 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) this one legitly stumped her. She would grasp the amulet, still attached to her fan, and see if it provided any clues before she tried to answer.* - Mon Oct 26 21:34:56 2015

"I . I made it. . Sensei. ."

She muttered. Then looked around.

"Got a bath?"* - Mon Oct 26 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) took off her fan, leaving it with her Sensei, before going in to take a bath.

She would slowly pulll off her clothing, dumping it into a basin of water and soap to stew for a little while as she diped her now naked body into the warm welcome water. She let it's heat consume her body and relax her tired and sore muscles. Her mind falling back into her place of zen. Acceptance of her life and all that came and went within it. She was in bliss. After loungeing in the water she would clean her long black hair with watermelon scented shampoo and conditioner, before she went to work on the clothing. She would was her cloithing and repairing any damages the clothing had suffered with her spare fabirc and tailoring prowess. Once this was all done she would dry her clothes and redress, rejoining Fuji refreshed.* - Mon Oct 26 22:08:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Sir! - Tue Oct 27 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was calm as she watched the Kazekage perpare himself for his jutsu. She was not the type to slouch when it came to self improvement. She was careful in her mindset, not missing a beat. She wait untill after he performed the jutsu to begin herself. She would take up a netural stance and call upon her chakra, allowing it to infuse her whole being before she abrutbly turned to face the rock!

This acomplished, she would form the proper handsigns. and begin to kned her chakra before trying to expell the Chakra forward forward. What came out was nothing short of a failure. She would refuse to look upon her leader as she shrunched up her shoulders and prepared to try once more.

Her body would shake as she once more summoned up the proper amount of chakra from within her body. Holding onto it within her lungs as she looked back ar her target. The rock from before.  She would pull her upper body backwards, then form the three handsigns she knew to be the trigger for the jutsu. Once more she would blow air out and nothing else.

Her failures would not be her undoing! She would try once more  to move into the jutsu in questrion. She would inhale deeply,kneeding her chakra and letting it uild within her body before looking back out towards the rocks. This was much harder without having the jutsu explained, or some knowladge to go off of first. She would once more form her handsigns and throw her self forward. This time only small weak bullets of wind would be produced.* - Tue Oct 27 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) continued to work on the jutsu! She would intake air first this time, Letting her lungs fill and then would form the handsigns, then allow her chakra to mix with it all. The combonation would fail, and Then would feel her usual demenor falter.

She quickly shook off her feelings of self doubt and would intake another breath of air as her chakra began to flow within her lungs and inter mingleing  with one another before she would form the handsigns once more, thinking of the jutsu and tried expelling the stored up chakra. Once more weak bullets of air were produced. She would grin, at least it was progress!

She would inhale deeply once more as she began kneeding her chakra first  and letting it build within her self. This was much harder but more gratifyig then she had origannly thought it would be.. She would once more form her handsigns and throw her self forward. This time slightly bigger, but still weak bullets of wind would be produced.

She was begining to get excited! her work was imporveing in leaps and bounds. She was growing bolder. Her body posture altering and her normal happy aura returning. She would once more intake air, gather chakra, and move to form the handsigns, only shit time she would flub up the signs in her excitement. When she relaised what she had done she would release the pent up air and get ready to begin again. 

Her mistake noted she would gather up more chakra in her lungs. Letting it build within their as her chakra ghathered, mixxing together and forming into one force as she formed her handsigns and once more tried to produce the jutsu within her then push out her jutsu, only to produce baseball sized balls of air that splatted agasint the cactus. 

She would once more intake her air, wipeing sweat from her brow, as she gathered her chakra and let it build in her chest. She would look out at the cactus now and formed her handsigns and expell the jutsu forward. This lacked forced just as much as the last had. 

She would shift uncomfterbaly untill she was at an easier posture to handle then once more gather her chakra into her body, then air. Letting both gether into her lungs comfterably untill she formed the handsigns and let lose the jutsu, This time several small marble shaped bullets were produced, but they still lacked any force what so ever. 

She would once more intake her as she gathered her chakra and let it build in her chest. She would look out at the rock now  with a renewed look of determination and formed her handsigns. She would throw herbody forward and blow out several baseball sized bullets of highly compressed wind, each rockecting suddenly forward with renewed forced and destrctive nature. They would all collide with what's left of the rock and demolish it completley!* - Tue Oct 27 04:12:35 2015
