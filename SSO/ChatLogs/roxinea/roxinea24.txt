<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) was already in a foul mood. She would remain in the doorway. 

"I need you both to leave the room for the time being. I will not be hurting her. I have to do what I have to do to prove her innocnce. . If you impeed me, your only going to hurt Kiyoko and make her look guilty. Just leave for a moment so I can finishe my investigation, then bury ANOTHER of my students."

She said simply, and evenly.* - Tue Nov 17 07:52:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) has already had it up to her eyeballs with all of this Drama. Like how everyone thought she was some kind of serial killer when she had -NEVER- done anyting close to such a thing as murder, aside from when the ROUGE ninja Mazora had been marked for death, and even then, she had not killed anyone. She now bore and aura of utter distaste for how she, a Jounin and private, was being treated by Aza and Bryson. 

"Please. . Just sit out in the damned hallway for a few minutes. . I need to do this. . I am TRYING to be nice and civil about all of this. I just want this to be over as fast as possible.. Your only making this more difficult by treating me like some kind of Villan!"* - Tue Nov 17 08:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) sighed softly and adcanced forward, pulling over a baisn of water. 

"disrobe, Clean up, I have some spare clothing for you."

She said simply, placeing a clean white outfit nearby before turning, so the girl could mantain some modesty* - Tue Nov 17 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) turned around and looked upon Kiyoko. 

"This is hard, I know. . but I have examined the body, and it all adds up to self defense. I just need to perform the interrogation jutsu upon you and ask a few questions to solidfy it. Once done, I can close this case. Are you okay with that?"* - Tue Nov 17 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) sighed softly and formed the required handsigns, then placed her hand upon the girls head. She would find herself falling into a deep sleep, that ended with her and Marrisa floating in a large room filled with various fileing cabnits that contained knowladge. 

"Alright. . no pain if you don't lie, pretty simple. I'll be breif. Did you attack and kill, Nina for any reason other then Self defense."* - Tue Nov 17 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) nodded  and spoke for a moment

"I know. . Kinda surreal huh?"

and asked one more question. 

"Was there any history of animosity between you and Nina prior to this event?"* - Tue Nov 17 08:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) nodded slightly but understood.

"Are you aware of the fact that Lera and Violet had adopted Nina?"* - Tue Nov 17 08:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled softly, Marrisa was at her heart a nice person. She just had some shitty rumors floating around about her. 

"I judge you innocent. This was an act of self defense, and will be treated as such. Thank you for your couaparation."

With that, the jutsu was broken, and Kiyoko was free to return to the waking world. Marrisa would wait for her to be back at one hundred percent before speaking.

"Anything you'd like to ask or declare?"* - Tue Nov 17 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You are not to blame . .  - Tue Nov 17 08:59:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled as she watched the girl begin to walk away. Her body was already feeling better. Hassan had been right, just need to walk it off after all! she would intake a deep breath before she walked towards the center of the arena. She had been slouching for far to long, and it was time to get back into training mode! 

She would allow her chakra to surge through her body, utilizeing the Earth technique lighter rock. She would begin to flooat a few feet off the ground! She was happy she was getting the hang of this jutsu! She would roll her shoulders and concentrait on her next intended jutsu. Takeing a moment to ready herself

She would form several handsigns, then inhale, before spewing mud out from within her body. It would coat the ground of the arena with some intensity, covering a wide range as she smiled. She had enjoyed learning Earth style in the end. It had a lot of versitility, whice enabled her to expand her fighting style!

She would then form a new series of handsigns, focusing on the mud. It would begin to quiver and then in a sudden rush of motion, would form a large muddy dragon's head and neck. The dragon wasted no time in fireing off a large volly of earth bullets into the side of the mountain, whice in turn would knock large and small chunks of earth onto the field and into the mud. 

She would then form her handsigns once more, again after a breif brake, to cause the stones in the area to shudder then raise from the mud, and shoot off towards the wall once more. This jutsu also had a good range of usefullness to it. It made her happy to have such a technique. 

She would then, still floating and after her rest, bite into her thumb. She would smear the blood upon her fan and swing it, completeing the contract she had formed with the sickle weasles, and summon her ally. He would nod to her as he rushed off with the wind, blowing mud and sind and rocks all over the fiels, cutting them into pieces as he went! He would vanish as quickly as he came once the jutsu had ended.

This completed, she would land upon the ground and exhale, before forming a series of handsigns, and then bringing her hands down upon the ground. This would cause a smaller weasle to pop into existince and nod to Marrisa, running up her leg to perch on her shoulder!* - Wed Nov 18 10:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) was breathing softly, as if she had recently exerted herself. A weasle sat upon her shoulder as she turned to look upon Akira. She smiled to him before sitting down. The weasle would nuzzle her cheek before jumping from her shoulder and vanishing into a plume of smoke!

"Hello Akira. . Why did Hassan aplogise to me about you?"* - Wed Nov 18 11:01:20 2015
