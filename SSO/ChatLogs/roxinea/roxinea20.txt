<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mind if I come along? - Tue Nov 10 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I haven't got much else to do. - Tue Nov 10 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: of course. . The more the merrier - Tue Nov 10 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) twists and turn, then rushes to Ortho, attempting to tackle hug him!* - Tue Nov 10 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) smiles and kisses Ortho deeply!

"Wanna come watch us train! I got a whole week off!"

She annouced with a happy smile! It was clear she missed him!* - Tue Nov 10 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: I didn't know they were a thing. - Tue Nov 10 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) smiles and backs away, looking to Ziare.

"Let's go. . It's time to train Ziare."* - Tue Nov 10 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki Shakaku(Dazzer) says: Hey there. - Tue Nov 10 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Right.. - Tue Nov 10 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hey new guy. - Tue Nov 10 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: It's Daiki. - Tue Nov 10 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hey Daiki. - Tue Nov 10 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I'm new around here. - Tue Nov 10 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Hello. .  - Tue Nov 10 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Fancy showin' me the ropes? - Tue Nov 10 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am Marrisa. . I don't live here.  - Tue Nov 10 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Come along with us. . Ziare and I are about to spar. - Tue Nov 10 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Wonder if you guys can teach me anything. - Tue Nov 10 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Probably not. - Tue Nov 10 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Alright. .  - Tue Nov 10 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) got into a ready postion! She would look to Ziare and nod. It was time for her to show him why she would never stop trying to train him!

"Whenever you are ready my pint sized friend!"* - Tue Nov 10 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: #.. - Tue Nov 10 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: So, either of you guys watching any good? - Tue Nov 10 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) siled and formed a strange handseal! One that was normally only used by the Nara clan! Her own ilongated shadow would shoot out from it's place and chase after the boy at shocking speeds! It's intention to latch onto the boy's shadow and freeze him in place!

"No running now!"

She called out with a happy tone!* - Tue Nov 10 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) felt him try to clash wth her shadow, and smiled. The plan had worked like a charm! She would surge her chakra forward to overpower the younger ninja's shadow technique! She would, should it all go as planned, capture his shadow and grin. Letting lose the handseal, she would walk towards Ziare, forceing him to walk towards her. * - Tue Nov 10 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) stood a few feet away from Ziare with a smile as she turned to face the crowd, foceing Ziare to do so as well! She would then. . begin to dance! She put her left foot in, she put her left foot out, she put her left foor in and she shook it all about!* - Tue Nov 10 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) Stopped the dance and turned to face Ziare once more. She would let the connection to the jutsu end as she moved forward in sudden blur. Her body surgeing forward to throw a strong left hook aimed for his chest! She would put enough power behind the punch to knock him backwards, and across the dirt, but not enough to deal major damage. Holding back enough of her power to prevent anything more then a bruse from being his received damage!* - Tue Nov 10 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: I've...never...Felt like this before... - Tue Nov 10 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) felt the shift in his demenor! She had mamanged it! She had broken through his cloud of indiffrence. She was seeing real determination upon his face. This brought great amounts of joy to her heart! She watched him prepare another attack, the kunai being drawn. She would grin and clap for him, one single sharp clap! 

However, what was produced was a ball of wind that would nock the kunai away from her at amazing speeds, aimed to blow the kunai off, past the gate, and somewhere into the grove of trees between here and the kages mansion!* - Tue Nov 10 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) has a moment of thought. She could let him land this blow, take it as if he had suprised her. She quickly thought agasint it as it would only insult him! She would lean backwards, reaching back and grasping and swinging her fan up in the same motion! The result would be a dodge of the incoming kick and a burst of none leathal wind intended to knock the boy backwards into the field! * - Tue Nov 10 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) grinned and nodded. She would form three quick handsigns. Her chakra flowing out fo her and into the ground. In a flash of movement and speed, four spikes of earth would shoot out of the ground! Normally, they would be tipped with deadly pointed ends, but for the purpose of the spar, They were all blunted. They aimed to pin the young Genin in place!* - Tue Nov 10 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: An earth jutsu...I should ask her to teach me some stuff... - Tue Nov 10 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Wonder if anyone here could help a new genin out and teach me the ropes.. introduce me to people and perhaps teach me some cool stuff. - Tue Nov 10 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) formed a string of three handsigns. Focusing upon the boy now entraped in the confines of her earth jutsu! A ring of fire would erupt around him, then fade. Marrisa herself would now be moving towards him slowly! It was time for one of her lessons to come to fruit here! * - Tue Nov 10 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm. Can't seem to find anyone. - Tue Nov 10 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: No one's around. - Tue Nov 10 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) saw him go limp and nodded. She dismissed all her jutsu. In a flash of movement, his friends were gone, the earth was reeceding as Marrisa walked forward. 

"That is why you need to Master the Kai Technique. . So you will never have to relive whatever it was that jutsu forced you to watch!"

Her posture was diffrent now, more stern, and mature. Her usual aura of pleasentness was still there, but it was edged with the harsh truth she had imparted upon him. * - Tue Nov 10 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: A..Akira wasn't it? - Tue Nov 10 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm? - Tue Nov 10 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah. - Tue Nov 10 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Was wonderin' if you could introduce me to all the key people of our village.. - Tue Nov 10 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Perhaps even teach me some things I should know. - Tue Nov 10 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Ok well. - Tue Nov 10 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Look around. - Tue Nov 10 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Thats all the key people. - Tue Nov 10 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Besides Marrisa. - Tue Nov 10 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Besides that lady* - Tue Nov 10 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: As for things to teach, I got nothing. - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Ah. So.. Who's the high ups? - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: We have no higher ups. - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Everyone is a genin. - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Don't we have a kage? - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No, He died a week or so ago. - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: DAIKI FOR KAGE - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) was shocked to see him jump up and throw shuriken at her! She slipped into a whole new level of fighting! Her body moved in a blur, tapping into her full speed and reflexes. Her body shifting to the left then rushing forward in one full on rush movement! Her fist flew forward, aimed for his left arm! Though, at the last moment, she would pull her punch as much as she could! This punch would likely leave a very healthy bruse and leave him with a "Dead Arm" For a small while after if it hit!* - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hmm.. That sucks. - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Man. I need a sensei.. - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So do I. - Tue Nov 10 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Heh. Both in the same boat I suppose. - Tue Nov 10 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah, Might ask that lady after her spar. - Tue Nov 10 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: She seems to know a thing or two. - Tue Nov 10 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hmm. That does seem like a good idea. - Tue Nov 10 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I'll let you have her though, no point slumping two of us onto her. - Tue Nov 10 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Judging by that hip movement. I'm guessing this is the village bike. - Tue Nov 10 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: They're still going at it..? - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Atta boy, Ziare.. - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I knew you showed potential. - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) was in fact momentairly stopped, whice only fed the new sense of adrenealine that was running through her. She would surge her chakra through her body and struggle to break free and away from the ingiuitive genin! 

Outcome 1: 

She broke free of the jutsu almost as quickly as she was entraped, due to the differnce in power and skill between the two combatents, and aimed to make distance backwards between the two of them with a mix of astonishment and pride upon her face!

Outcome 2.

She remained stuck in place as her body tried to break free of the sudden binding!* - Tue Nov 10 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) felt her body move agasint her will. She was really proud of Ziare, so proud she almost let him have this win, just for the amount of effort he put into the spar. Once again, she would opt agasint it. It felt wrong to just give up like that. She felt like he was not the one to take a fake win well, and besides that, she was not going to give up on her student without a fight! Her eyes would suddenly blaze red from behind her tinted goggles and an aura of flame would erupt around her body! 

In this new moment she would attempt to once more break free from the jutsu's that binded her. She assumed the earlier binding would be replaced by the imitation jutsu he had used to force her to move. The kunai would remain in place around her neck, though she was now attempting to overpower the jutsu enough to release her hold upon it!* - Tue Nov 10 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) continued to fight agasint his intentions. She may not be able to break out of the jutsu, but she could continue to fight agasint it. She would smile behind her Aura of flame! 

"I am not one to give up. . and besides. . I doub't you have the power to make me cut my own skin. . I am supriseingly durable!"* - Tue Nov 10 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Way to go Z! - Tue Nov 10 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) grinned and steps back, her usage of chakra relaxing, first on her sharingan then on her aura of flame. It would vanish as fast as it had came. 

"You did well. . I almost had you there. . Heh. . I'll have to start wearing my headband around my neck. . Now. . Will you stop holding back and let me train you?"

She asked, looking upon Ziare with a full blown smile.* - Tue Nov 10 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm not holding back. - Tue Nov 10 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And why would I want to be trained? - Tue Nov 10 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Oi. - Tue Nov 10 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't think this is quite done. It's been a while since I've went a round with you, Marrisa. - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I must've fallen behind in my training, but I'm sure I can entertain you well. - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What do you say? - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: ....he's going to fight her? - Tue Nov 10 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) turned to look at Ortho. She knew would not have to hold back agasint Ortho. She smiled and nodded as she first tossed several tools to Ziare, to replace the ones he had used or lost in the spar as well as some money to go and get him and his friends some new equipment, then looked to Ortho. She walked back to her starting postion.

"Yea, I am game. . but. . I won't hold back! You might get really hurt my love! You sure you want to Tango with me?"* - Tue Nov 10 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Love? Are they close or together? - Tue Nov 10 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Hm... - Tue Nov 10 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Don't think I've been noticed yet, ooOoo I'm invisible.~ - Tue Nov 10 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Sure whats on your mind hun? - Tue Nov 10 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well uh...I was just wondering if you wanted to go to that tea shop any time soon..? - Tue Nov 10 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled at her boyfriend and entered her ready postion. Her eyes flared with chakra, the sharingan blooming to life upon their surface, with two black tome upon their surface, the only evidince of her normal black eye color. She would inhale and then think to herself.

"I guess it's time to put the new stye into practice. I hope you are proud of me Lord Hassan. I will do my best to impress! It's time I become the next wind goddes!"

Her body would seem to fill with chakra, the Sensory ninja's of the group would see it before it actually took form. In one fluid motion her body would erupt in wind, sending her a few feet off the ground as she hovered in place. This acomplished, she would suddenly shoot forward at nearly untraceable speeds with her fist cocked backwards, aimed to slam into her lovers chest! The wind itself would also cut up anywhere it made contact on someone's person!* - Tue Nov 10 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Hmm, thats cool... I wonder what she is doing? And are there traces of chakra in her eyes? And why am I asking so many questions ? I really dont care.... - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Hmm.. So he knows fire style? - Tue Nov 10 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: I'm guessing I better speak to him soonish.. - Tue Nov 10 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) was no fool, and had spotted his formation of seals even as he made them, She knew those handseals as a jutsu she herself possesed. She would alter he plan of action. Her movements were no longer tied to her feet! She would shift suddenly and completely! The armor she wore gave her a limited ability to fly afteral! Her body rocked suddenly east ward as he completed the formation of his seals. Likeky causeing him to alter when he released his fireball! Hopeing she had managed to avoid a turn one TKO she would take a gamble!

Her left hand would shoot outwards, four fingers entended as chakra began to gather thier! She would rush forward suddenly once more, thrusting her hand, and the newly formed blade of wind, right for his right shoulderblade!* - Tue Nov 10 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) once more, pushed herself forward, She was going to try and cut through the jutsu, banking on her manipulation of her element, and continue on with her intention to implace ortho on the shoulder! She had thought she would be able to end this quickly with her newfound speed, but alas, nothing ever goes as planned with Marrisa!* - Tue Nov 10 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ..... - Tue Nov 10 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Did I just get blown off because of where I'm from? - Tue Nov 10 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) had cut through the fireball! Whice only led her to a new problom of a sudden gathering of fire chakra upon Ortho's feet! She pulled out all the stops on this one, litteraly. She would attempt to throw herself into a sudden reverse, banking on her reflexes and speed to allow her to save herself from becomeing a Marria's shaped bomb! 

Should this work, she would dive bomb Ortho once more, Sending a massive kick toward his chest!

Should it not? Well. . Boom goes the fire cracker my firneds. She would be thrown backwards by the winds that encased her body taking up the fire provided. She woudl land upon the ground with a loud thump! Her body smokeing! * - Tue Nov 10 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm waiting for a friend at the moment. - Tue Nov 10 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm. - Tue Nov 10 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Owari. Would you like a spar? - Tue Nov 10 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) cursed internally! She had to push herself now. It was time to ger serious! She would find her kick stopped, and herself rapidly captured within the well placed dome! She would fly to one end, then summon up her earlier hand blade throwing herself full forced at Ortho's postion. Thankfull for her sharingan and imporved eyesight! She would cleave through the wall before her, pushing her speed to maxximum as she tried one last sudden thrust for Ortho's left arm! * - Tue Nov 10 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the fireballs come forth! She dove down! Banking on the wind armors ability to allow her to manuver on a moment's notice with her useage of the air currents! She would trie to get under the jutsu, banking on her speed to allow her to get under the fireball before it was completley formed! 

Should this go without fail she would shift her attack to another kick! Shifting her body in a span of a single moment. She was already feeling the strain of the wind armor! She would not be able to continue fighting like this! * - Tue Nov 10 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Fuck.. - Tue Nov 10 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Can't make the kid get hurt... - Tue Nov 10 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Why the fuck he decide to stand behind me..? - Tue Nov 10 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) did something crazy! She shut off the wind armor! The winds would vanish as quickly as they had come! She took the fire damage! Allowing it to burn her as she endevoured to land her iniatal kick! She did not let up on her attack! * - Tue Nov 10 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ..... - Tue Nov 10 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) had been hoping he would make a ploy like this! The snakes erupted forward, and so did her chakra! In one fluid motion she pushed her chakra out in one huge burst! The wind armor would erupt once more aournd her person as the snakes aimed to grasp her! She prayed her jutsu would erupt to life before she could be bit, She had seen this jutsu from Hideki, and it caused her great amounts of fear! The sucess of this plan really coming down to how fast her timeing acted based on how fast his snakes wrapped around her.

If she suceeded, she would attemot to slam a fist into the right shoulder blade of ORtho.

If not, well, it was unlikely she managed to fully form the Wind armor, considering the paralyzeing venom!* - Tue Nov 10 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Excuse me. Miss with the read hair. Fancy a spar? - Tue Nov 10 07:41:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) let the wind armor fade. The numbness was already spreading throughout her body. She would fall forward into hisgrasp, burying her face in his chest. She buryed every feeling of pity and sorrow over her loss. She had not even managed to land a single hit upon the love of her life, and to top it all off, he had once more toled her he would not be with her right now. She was broken in every sense of the word, but when she tried to stand to look upon him, her face was a picture of happiness! 

"Thanks love. . I am sorry I wasn't able to land a hit on you. . I'll try and at least do that much next time. Okay?"

She lowered her voice to a whisper only he could hear.

"I refuse to let go of my feelings. . You can leave me behind all you want, but my heart wont change."* - Tue Nov 10 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Why would I need luck? - Tue Nov 10 07:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll check over her. - Tue Nov 10 08:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) leaned back agasint the fence. She was doing well hdieing her dissapointment. 

"So. .Rias. . Ziare. . I think today we will work on a low level jutsu. . IT's called the wire trap technique. . IT can come in handy. ."

She said, and formed a single handsign, summoning up a shadow clone. She would then form a string of handsigns, allowing a length of wire to shoot out from her sleeves to ensnare the clone, and with a single act of brutality, would pull the wires taunt, cutting into it's flesh. It bled for a moment before vanishing into a puff of smoke!  She would then toss a new spool of wire to both her would be students!
* - Tue Nov 10 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Right. . So the process behind this jutsu is deceptivly simple - Tue Nov 10 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You keep the spool hidden in your sleeve or on your belt, or where ever. Then you gather up chakra and form your handsigns, flowing it into the hidden wire. With that don, you use your chakra to direct where you want the wire to go. It can be amazingly helpful in combat, or in a suprise attack.  - Tue Nov 10 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well its not so much of a surprise to the two people behind us - Tue Nov 10 08:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I can believe we could never take him in real fight - Tue Nov 10 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) thinks: some defender of the weak. . I couldn't even keep up with Ortho. .  - Tue Nov 10 08:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) claps for Ziare and stands shakily. Her Vacation was likely going to have to take an abrubt end. She needed to get home, but she would try to find Ortho one last time.

"I am Private Marrisa, Jounin of the sand. I am here on leave, and have been teaching Ziare and his friends a few new jutsu and battle tactics. . "

She would make sure nothing would be left for Ziare to do while she was within the village, and wuld feed herel. She smiled thankfully to Ziare. 

"I am honored you would allow me to stay. . My thanks."* - Tue Nov 10 10:13:32 2015

"This jutsu is utilized, buy focsueing your chakra into the dirt and rocks within the ground. Once enough of your chakra had been amassed. . You Force it to erupt forth. Make sure you focuse enough chakra to make four pillers."

She would form three handsigns in a minor blue of speed and threw her hands forward, allowing wires to shoot forward and wrap around the beserker, aiming to pin his arms and legs together!.

She would not be allowing the laws to be shirked again.* - Tue Nov 10 23:57:52 2015
