Well, it was really a undersuit for fighting, but it was cut like a bathing suit, with a top and bottom half, so she went with it and then dived into the water. Her own body held its share of stories, several scars could be seen around her ankles, wirsts, and covering her abdomen and a large part of her back.

"Tell me about your tattoo"

"Lord Kazekage. I am Marrisa. . I was taken from this village by Erebus during it's time without a leader. I was hoping to return home, now that we have a leader."

She asked this humbly, and without arogance. Her voice respectful and her stance netural. She would also be presenting her new Kazekage scrolls for the villages Archive, if he so wanted them.* - Tue Oct 13 05:31:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) took a deep breath and pulled her fan off her back, and then held it open before her, throwing her fire nature chakra effortlessly forward into her fan. It's edges would rapidly alight in a burning line. The fan would mantain it's fire without hindrince or without any faces from Marrisa. It was clear she had not only picked up Fire training, she had also mastered the jutsu she now used.

(for the sake of not having to post more then one RP)

After a few moments she would move into her next jutsu. Swinging the now burning fan she would push her wind nature chakra into it's surface. Excuteing a mastered Divine wind jutsu through her fan, useing the fire upon her tool of choice, to create it's fire tsunami version, crawling across the sand before dissapiting as she did not continue to feed it chakra.* - Tue Oct 13 06:06:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) put the fan back upon her back nestled into it's holster. She held an obvious blush, not one of girlish fancy but of modesty and suprise. She was not used to getting complimented for her hard work, and it brought her a sense of peace she had not known since the passing of her adopted brother. Her muscles seemed to losen up and her eyes softened. Though a deep burning emotion still lingered within them. She would look upon Fujitora with an air of pride as she spoke.

"I used to want revenge. .  and to be honest I still do. I can feel the need for Vengence thrumming within my body just beneath my skin like an ever beating drum. I however have begun focusing my efforts on self imporvement, and the gathering of knowladge. I had to do something more productive then sit beating myself agasint the wall of my rage."

She said and the paused to take a deep breath before she realised she had not actually answered the question properly then added.

"My goals are Self imporvment. For the betterment of myself and the world around me. So I can avenge my brother and honor his memory by doing my best to prevent that kind of bloodshed from ever happening again."* - Tue Oct 13 06:28:16 2015

She would not risk endering herself quite yet, only aiming to make one clone, though this task would prove harder then first anticpaited.

She called upon it one last time, throwing chakra throughout her body as she began to form a picture in her mind, of a second her, standing beside her. She would continue to stimulate her chakra in this manner, letting it build within her as she finally pushed her chakra formward and formed the handsign, Causeing a plume of white smoke to envolpe the area before her, and produce a single clone.* - Wed Oct 14 02:21:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) grinned at the coming beast, flipping her fan off her back and waited only a moment for the shuriken to be launched then then suddenly swung her fan. Her eyesight was not marksmen like but it was able to pick out small details. She followed the launch with a boost of concussive wind, The shurikin being super sped within the gale storm. Her mind was already working on ways to defeat this thing. Her form shitfed into one that could botl at a moment's notice and shouted out. 

"If you can time it to work, throw just after if closes it's mouth after a lightning jutsu is used, you'll need to time it perfectly" 

She called out to Izanami. She trusted that her wind would at least cause this bug brain a bit of annoyance. Considering wind was strong agasint lighting, this would play into her advantage. * - Wed Oct 14 04:56:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked at the new orders and threw herself backwards, trusting in her unusually well trained speed for a fan user. She couldn't really even explain it, she had always been really good at running! She kept her fan in hand, prepared to do any damage she could. She didn't enjoy the fact they were being ordered to run from the best but she was going to follow orders. 

Her fan was swung at a rapid, fluid, well trained paced as the beast came close and was deflected by the roation. The kunoichi focused a large amount of chakra into the incoming attack, createing a small wall of wind bullets all aimed for the beast's massive eyes. She knew she was no marksmen, but fuck those were large targets, so maybe she'd get lucky, with the beast so close.* - Wed Oct 14 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Mhmm..I could probably lift her up there but..If its capable to do..-that- thing it did before...she'll be dead. - Wed Oct 14 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: If its that fast..maybe I can get it..I can't catch them in the attack..I'll probably take dammage, though its not fast enough..my last defense shall hold it.. - Wed Oct 14 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) grinned and allowed her chakra to rush into her fan, as she seemed freed of the intended grasp of pain, she wasn't ready to give up no yams to no gaint ass fly. She fell back toward the ground but swung her fan regardless, allowing a powerfull burst of wind to erupt forward, sending the normal sized rotation into overdrive. 

The result would be spectacular, she hoped, only that left her on the ground, so if she could managed, she would dodge that things massive pointed ass, to the best of her ability. She was known for her rapid movements when training, so she hoped this would be enough. * - Wed Oct 14 06:07:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the inomcing fire meteor, and decided to do something strupid. She threw herself into the air, Letting the stinger stab into her stromach with no movements to stop it and launch her off into the, the sound of blood and flesh being shifted would be notable. The girl grimmiced as she flew over the incoming meteor, and swung her fan with all the strength left in her body. Sending a plume of high powered wind behind the incoming Iza's. What would already be a strong attack, would now be doubled in power through the use of the wind style on fire style. The Kunoichi grinned as she now fell, collideing into the sand, and rolling to a tumbled stop, bleeding heavily.* - Wed Oct 14 06:27:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was in fact a bloody mess. Her stomach laied open like a freash can of suna brand salted jerky. Blood poured easily from the wound. It would look savage. She would look up at the medic and grimly smile. 

"D. . Did we win?"

She asked, choughing for effect, letting blood drape upon her clothing. She was fadeing fast, or so it seemed.

"I. . I need. . " 

She choughed again, really hamming it up before she spoke one last time.

"Naw, I am kidding, Dibs on the stinger though"

She called out before her whole body exploded into a plume of white smoke, scented of wild cherries, as the clone that had left suna with the group evaporated into nothing, the chakra used in keeping it together esxpired. Back in suna the real Marrisa smiled and looked over to Fujitora and nodded. 

"Mission completed."

Then proceeded to tell him all that happened, making Izanami, Koji and Tetsuijin out to be the real MVP's but still including her own actions without making them sound impressive.* - Wed Oct 14 07:00:16 2015
