<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the other shinobi with a small smile, closeing her eyes, letting her chakrta flow into her head once more. She would activate her hidden dojutsu. Opening her eyes they would not be red, with two black tome upon their surface. Though no one would be able to see that past her tinted goggles. 

She would suddenly rush forward, putting on a sudden burst of speed as she aimed to close the distance between them in a flash of movement. Fire erupted around her body in the same movement. She would aim to slam her fist into the same spot as before, this time without the debuff of being a clone!* - Fri Oct 30 12:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Too expensive. - Fri Oct 30 12:58:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) punched right through that wall, thoug it stopped there. She would smile at Sanoke and step back. 

"He wanted full force. . "* - Fri Oct 30 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. That was some pretty neat shit. . . Not gonna lie. - Fri Oct 30 13:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) dismissed her fire, stepping back to dust herself off as she began to sink into the grround.

"Round three?"* - Fri Oct 30 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You guys should stop. - Fri Oct 30 13:04:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) remained hidden underground for a moment, before suddenly shooting up out of the ground in a blaze of glory and power! The ground around Fukushu would be maliable at best!* - Fri Oct 30 13:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I mean, Would be interesting to see what -he- can do. - Fri Oct 30 13:07:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) realised she had forgotten to metion she was aiming to sock that bitch in the jaw. She would land and shut off the jutsu she had been useing, after pulling him free from it's clutches. She would then toss him into the air, clapping her hands as she did so. This would send a burst of wind chakra barraleing towards Fukushu at amazing speeds. * - Fri Oct 30 13:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I wish to take part in this spar - Fri Oct 30 13:20:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . . - Fri Oct 30 13:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) moved forward, forming a string of handsigns as the other shinobi fell. She would wait untill the boy was within a safe distance before casting forrth a series of small huricans. This would create a pocket of air for Angetsu to fall through, slowing their decsent considerably. Mixxed with the maliable ground and mud, he would be in apsolutly NO threat of damage.* - Fri Oct 30 13:40:28 2015
