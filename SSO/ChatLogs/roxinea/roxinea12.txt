<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) closed her eyes from behind her newly aquired tinted goggles. The len's made so that you could see out, but no one could see in. She would crack her neck as she inhaled deeply and called upon her chakra, letting it fill her being and then rush to her head. In a moment the normally black of her eyes faded from exstince, to be replaced wirth red, two black tome spinning to life upon it's surface as she opened her eyes. She would unclasp her fan and slip it into the containment scroll that she had gotten from Trill.

She declared, getting into a basic stance. * - Thu Oct 29 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked and then was suddenly moving forward at an almost blur! Her speed was in secret one of her greatest gifts. She would close the distance between the two of them as fast as she could with the intent to land the first blow of the spar! She was not really holding back, she trusted Ortho to keep up with her. Both of them were Ninjutsu fighters, so that made her assume they were on the same level Taijutsu wise. Should she managed to close the distane she would throw a strong punh for his lower abdomen.* - Thu Oct 29 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched in wonder as she saw what Ortho was planning just a fraction of a moment before he did it, quickly redistrubuting her strength. She would suddenly stop short and shoot up her hand and throw the incoming foot away from her in a split second counter. Her mind working in ways she had never done before. These eyes of hers were amazing! 

Should the counter go ahead as planned, she would prepare herself to move into the next attack! if not, she would likely fall right into the taijutsu technique Ortho was trying to perform!* - Thu Oct 29 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) suddenly jumps backwards,instead of trying to press her advantage, and thus ignoreing the incoming attack with a sudden burst of movement as she had spotted Baen.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shook her head, though she kept her field of vison low. She was now eternally greatful for her new goggles. Baen made her nervous, she had heard a great many things about the man. She would close her eyes, cutting off the flow of chakra to them, in case someone tried to remove her goggles.

"Let it out. . It's alrigjht, I understand."

She spoke softly, her ususal aura of postive energy flowing off of her in a constent. She would do her best to comfort Takedea.* - Thu Oct 29 06:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) allowed Takeda this moment of emotion. She would likely pat his shoulders while she looked to Fuji with a small nod. 

"I see. . I am sorry you have suffered such loss Takeda. . But I am still our friend. . I am still here"* - Thu Oct 29 06:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) nodded and continued patting Takeda's back, encourageing him to let it all out. She was a kind soul at her center. Though trurth be told, She was more then upset at the thought of him useing a kage's mansion as his own personal funeral pyre.* - Thu Oct 29 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) moved abrubtly. Pulling back and looking at him hard from behind her tinted goggles. She would bring her hand up and. . 

*WACK*

Her right hand would find purchess on his cheek. Given the fact they were in such close proximity, and her recent training in Taijutsu. This would likely sting quite abit as she spoke aloud.

"You are a shinobi! Your reason to life, is a simple one! Protect the weak and defensless of this world! Bring honor to your village! And MOST OF ALL, you have the memeories of those who have died! Do not pretend to insult Suitengu by saying you have nothing left to live for!"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched him walk away with a shrug. She had done whatever she could. If he chose to stain the memeories of those who fell before him, that was his own buiisness. She would sit cross legged upon the ground now and watch him go.* - Thu Oct 29 07:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) takes a new stance, shifting her shoulders as she summoned forth her Fire shroud. She would take up a defensive stance and watch her Kaze closely. 

"I am ready! Show me your armor and hell stab once more my lord! Let me see if I have imporved!"* - Thu Oct 29 07:45:55 2015

"I'd not have it any other way, Lord Kazekage! If I can not last a few blows with you, what hope do I have for the Gezo Exam?!"

She annouced with some small amount of pride.* - Thu Oct 29 07:51:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Felt the massive blow of wind upon her suddenly, luckily she was ready for just anout anything, allowing her to weather the sudden influx of wind. Her fire shroud armor took the fule and burned brighter. As this was raw wind from the activation of his technique. She would quickly form four handsigns, begining the spar off with a bang.

Four pillers of stone would erupt suddenly and silently from within the ground at amazing speeds. Though it was a long shot, she hoped that the Earth jutsu would be able to pierce the wind armor and do at least a little bit of damage. Her body remained tense throughout this whole endevour, ready for any counter the kazekage might have for her.* - Thu Oct 29 08:05:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) quivered in obvious fear now, Her body was sweating as she watched the man called the Kazekage float above her in a whirlwhind of death with a sword of air in his grasp. She tried to shake the fear from her body and moved back a bit, trying to distance herself from her leader as she struggled in vain to try and come up with a way to counteract his immense speed and Jutsu prowess. She would form five handsigns in this time, if allowed the time to do so. * - Thu Oct 29 08:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) thought she was going to do well in this spar, she truley believed she had a chance agasint her lord kazekage, at least for a few rounfs. She had came into the fight thinking she had even the slightest chance.of fighting the Kazekage. She even had a little image in her mind of the kazekage congraduatling her.

She was wrong. . Oh gods was she wrong. She had blinked, that's all it had been. In that span of a moment he was upon her and she could do nothing to stop him. She felt his jutsu implae her flesh, though it's damage was in facr deminised by the sharoud she wore, amd her natural durability, it still caused her massive pain that racked her whole body.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) advances forward from her postion under the tree. Her own body languaage had hardly changed since they left Suna. She felt betrayed that a member of the Gezo would threten her, for speaking her opinon no less. She would look upon Ortho, litterally the only man left other then Fuji who cared for her more then what was between her legs. She would smile softly at him. Her heart skipping a beat as she saw the damage to his hand. Her demenor would soften as she sped up, stopping beside him as she cupped his wounded hand with her own two. A soft green glow would form between them as she looked him in the eyes.

"I am sorry about all the Drama Love. . I will refrain from speaking my mine in public from here on out though. . "

She said softly, as if a small part of her was broken. She seemed to slump slightly as she healed his hand, slowly.* - Fri Oct 30 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) grinned as she kept up the healing chakra, blushing from the show of affection. The words he spoke reonayed within her body. She would smile brightly, enjoying the softer side of Ortho for a momet. She would then speak softly. Her body calming as she worked to heal the other Ryu's wounds.

"Truth be told. . I was slightly in the wrong. . I told Katsune, as a previous Hokage who claims to hate killing, she could have held back and not kill whomever is was she was talking about having killed. She took offense, threatened me, and I got defensive. Then Index threatened me. . "

She finished. She wanted to make sure she shared her equal part of the blame. Katsune was infact in the wronf, but Marrisa was partly responsiable. That was untill a bit of what Byron had said finally clicked, and the overly intelegent shinobi pieced together who was killed.

"OH. . OH MY GODS.. . .SHE KILLED SAEZA!"* - Fri Oct 30 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shivered with rage, her body shivering as she thought of all the effort she had put into saveing Saeza. All the love and affection she had for the girl was suddenly boiling into rage. A contained rage of utter hatred for The women known as Katsune. Saeza was the only girl who ever got sick around Bryson, and thus was the only logical option for having been the one that KAtsune had confessed to killing. She would look at Ortho, her eyes absonced from view by her Sharingan, and nodded weakly.

"I. . I will do my best."

She responded through short, and deep breahs.  She was letting her old rage run rampent in her mind, her sharingan blareing to life behind tinted goggles.* - Fri Oct 30 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt her anger boilign within her. She wanted to deny Ortho but sighed and shook her had.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) slumped down to the ground. Her body shivered, with rage and saddness. She had lost her star pupil and friend. Her mind was struggling with trying to comprehend who would kill Saeza. The new Saeza had not even been evil! She was a good girl, who only wante to make friends. * - Fri Oct 30 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) fell into Ortho's hug and cried deeply.into his chest. Though her nature was to forgive and foret. She knew this anger would not pass. She looked up at him and shook her head. 

"I am angry. . So very very angry. . I can feel it consumeing me. . "* - Fri Oct 30 01:40:16 2015
