<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked as she heard the kunai bounce off her wall, landing into the sand somewhere else all togerther. The wall itself did in fact not change. Her own chakra would rebuke his efforts. She would simle waiting.

HEr voice rang out from below.

"OH AKIRA! I KNOW YOU MISS YOUR DARLING RIAS! IF YOU WANT ME TO SHUT UP MAKE ME!"

She would exhale slowly, mulling over everything before coming to a clear solution. She would place a soft hand upon the girls shoulder and speak just as softly.

"Nina was alway prone to bursts of aggression and recklessness. I am deeply saddened that you were infact forced to kill her, but I accept you made a mistake. If this was an act of self defense, that you will not be in any trouble. However, I am going to take you to my home, you will get washed up, and then Lyan is going to look at your wounds, if you have any. Then you and I are going to have a very personal conversation."

She said this all with a level voice and a clear smile upon her face. She however lacked any of the positive aura she once had. It had been stripped from her because of her time with the Gezo and the various pitfalls that had befallen her as life had taken it's toll. * - Tue Nov 17 06:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) turned cold almost instantly. She turned and looked upon Sanoke, but said nothing. She returned to Kiyoko and fell to her knees. The cold aura fadeing just as fast as it came. She would thow open her arms and hug the girl, careful of her gash.

She would check for the girls sharingan being inactive or active as well.* - Tue Nov 17 07:17:20 2015
