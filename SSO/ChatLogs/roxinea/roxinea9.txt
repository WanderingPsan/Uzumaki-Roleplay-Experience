"Dear Marrisa, I'm so terribly sorry. I have no home, though. Sunagakure was never my home...The closest thing I felt to home was when I was with you. You were the one there for me when no one else was...And the reason I must leave. I could not bear the thought of losing you. I will not say goodbye; for saying "bye" is never good.

Being hurt inevitably breeds feelings of hatred towards your attacker. But when we hurt others, we have to deal with their hatred for us, and our own feelings of guilt. Knowing what it feels like to be hurt is exactly why we try to be kind to others. That’s what makes us humans. That is why I must live in solitude... 

I have loved you for some time....Bye, Marrisa."* - Thu Oct 22 05:53:42 2015

She wept openly as she led him up the hill to where his body would rest for some time following. 
Once they had arrived she would watch somberly as he was fastened to the dead tree. Every fiber of her being wanted to save him, to break every oath she had made. She couldn't though, He had made his play, and now he had to pay. Her hand tentatively touched the Dairy that she had yet to read.  She would never forget this ninja, not as long as she lived. 
She watched as Mokutsu made his finale words. She felt her soul breaking, and then all at once she let it all go. Though tears fell down her cheeks she was back on her island, back at peace from the pain of the world. This too was a lesson to learn. She would sigh softly and smile to Mokutsu, and approached him, hoping Tetsumi would allow her this favor. She would kiss Mokutsu, Right upon the lips before whispering to him.
"I love you too. I'll never let you be forgotten"
She quickly stepped back and stood, letting peace and calmness dictate how she portrayed herself in his last moments seeing her. Her face was a picture of happiness for him. Her smile worn with genuine joy and the pleasant feeling she usually gave off in full force as the setting sun stood behind her, giving the best image a man could get for a last one. She would hold this look and salute him as the iron sand fell across his face. She never stopped weeping. As soon as it was done she would fall to her knees, letting her emotions run their course and crying as she let them go.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) held onto her usual attidude, though now it was tinged with pain. She stood beside Izanami while she waited for who knows what. It was at this moment she would hear the voice of her newest apprentice. She would turn around and look upon Nyoko with a pleasent smile.

"Hello Nyoko, Yes, I am home now, so I would be happy to give you some hands on pointers. Lert's head to the training field. We can work on our training there without endangering anyone."

She finished before making a brisk pace for the training field. Once all was settled within the courtyard.* - Thu Oct 22 20:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Good luck. - Thu Oct 22 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled and formed three handsigns, the Ram, tiger, then snake. She would feel her chakra broil within her chest, She would then bring her armsa together, her palms palced faceing one another and cupped out like the turtle hermit wave, and would then thrust her hands forward.

"Wind Style: Great breakthrough"

She thought to herself, before pushing her hands forward and letting her chakra expode forward in a sold wave of pressure. It would burst forward and cut a line through the sand before her. A powerful wind that would dissapaite before slamming into the rock of the mountains at the south of the field.* - Thu Oct 22 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled brightly and clapped for her student. She knew the girl had a great  potentioal as a wind ninja.* - Thu Oct 22 21:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) flipped around and, without any hesitation, rushed forward and tried to tackle Ortho into a hug.

"I am sorry! I kind of cheated on you!"

She said, knowing they were not a couple, but still feeling quitly about trying to ease Mokutsu's passing.* - Sat Oct 24 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) clinged to Ortho, tears already forming as she began to explain in detail what happened to Mokutsu. She told of her teaching him, and never actually loving him, or even enjoying his compnay past him being a student of hers. She then went on to tell him of the moment he almsot let his inner demon take control, her saving him, and his growing crush on her. She then told him of how Mokutsu had went rouge, and caused herself and Tetsumi to hunt him down and exacute him. 

"And. .Then I kissed him and told him I loved him back. . to ease his passing! Please. . Don't be mad . . I. . I just coulden't let him die alone. . not when I was the one who captured him!"* - Sat Oct 24 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) took a step back and looked upon Orotho with a wounded expression. She knew she had hurt Ortho, but she had hoped he would understand and forgive her. She could tell from the sound of his voice, that was not the case. She knew better then to expect anything in this world. She would at least try to salvage things, She didn't want to lose Ortho.

"Please. . .Forgive me. . I. . I care very deeply about you. . I only said what I said, Did what I did, because of the guilt I had for sending him to his death. . I. . I don't wanna lose you Ortho!"* - Sat Oct 24 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt her eyes fall as she tried to grasp his cloak. She was hurting herself, though there was something else within her eyes, a sensation she had taken to living her life by. A calmness that was accepting the pain even as it came, loveing life for what it was and not letting her mind be consumed by the pain. 

"Ortho . . I won't as you to forgive me right away. I just want you to try. . IF you can. . I care very deeply about you. . but I wont force you to stay. . If you feel as though we can not recover from this. . I will accept that. . as much as it hurts me."* - Sat Oct 24 04:51:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) quickly threw off her clothing and fan and jumped into the water in nothing but her underwear. She was comfterable enough with Ortho at this point, that such an action would not cause her to much discomfort.* - Sat Oct 24 05:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Pulled herself out of the water and turned and brought both her hands back and summoned up her chakra, standing dripping wet at the shore, then clapped with all her might, sending a ball of chakra barrleing forward, shooting across the water. 

"Wind style: Gale Palm!" 

She said aloud. Then pulled a scroll from her pile of clothing and tossed it to him. It was, as always, super detailed and highly helpful.* - Sat Oct 24 06:04:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched as Nina launched a jutsu at her in a sudden, and shockingly aggresive fashion. The Kunoichi was shocked, to say the least, and would respond in kind. She would wuickly clap her hands together, infuseing her chakra into the clap. The result would be a blast of wind several times stronger and faster then Nina's own tornado as it formed, aiming to shatter the jutsu.

Her own body moved in a sudden and rapid fashion, moving almost at a blur as she shot away from the now charging Kunoichi. What was supposed to be a normal demonstration had quickly turned into a spar without her agreement. * - Sat Oct 24 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked and shrugged as she looked around, noticeing Lera and Violet. What were members of the mist doing here in the sand? She shook her head, mantaining her smile and easy aloof attidude. 

"Sorry Nina, I didn't realise you wanted to spar. . I don't have time to fight right now. . but I promise to give you a no holds barred spar to truely test your might soon. " 

That said she would try to dismiss the look upon Nina's face. She had done nothing wrong, and was quite frankly getting tired of everyone quilt tripping her all the time. She would return to Ortho's side. Looking over at NAlenth.
