<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sat in the dirt now, fighting back the urge to give into the saddness at loseing her first and closest friend. Sure, Erebus had been alot of things to alot of people, but he had been the one person to give her purpose and reason to strive forward again. She shivered and looked around before she brought her hands together and prayed in silance.

"Oh Janshin. . I am not a loyal follower, or anything of the sort. . but I pray to you now. . In hopes that though my prayers Erebus will receive all the more praise even now in death, as he sits at your right hand. He was a true and loyal follower. He was my first friend. . and my goal in life. . "

She whimpered softly, unable to hold in her emotions for long. She allowed tears to fall down her cheeks, staining her white collar as her herbal smoke tumbled from her lips, landing upon the grass and sputtering out. She was in pain, and it was unlikely that in the group she was in, any would care.* - Mon Oct  5 01:12:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shuddered and all at once collapsed to the ground. The sound coming from within her bossom was not human. Her already cracking emotional mask suddenly and completley broken. Tears ran down her cheeks in a sudden and steady torrent. 

"N.. NO!"

She screamed as loud and as hard as she could, louder then she had ever screamed before in her life. Her body shook with uncontrolled rage and sorrow. Though she may not have known Suitengu very long, she had come to care for him as family, even if he had always been distant to her. She felt his lose deep in her soul, resonateing with the loss of the man she had secretly loved, Erebus.  Her whole world had been made up of those two, and now it was gone. Stripped from her by an unknown force never to grace her life again.* - Thu Oct  8 06:47:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) rose to her feet suddenly sillent after the brutes harsh and sudden declration. He was right, though tears still freely fell from her eyes and cascaded down her cheeks. She stalked forward, pushing past the slightly irritated indavidual. She was shaking, clearly barley able to hold back her earlier outbursts. She had a new look in her eyes, one that had never graced her form before. 

Her face showed anger, in its truest and rawest form. Rage unlike any she had ever felt before in her twenty odd years alive.

She locked eyes on the brute known as Maloth. She spoke, her voice barley a whisper as she formed the sentences in her mind. She would make sure he heard her, so that her intetions would not go amiss. Her mind snapping in ways she would likely never come back from. She wanted nothing more then to remove the source of her newfound pain and anquish from this mortal world, but it was not the brute of a man that this new found rage was directed at, but the nameless figure of the indavidual who had murdered the only person since her long missing brother she had dared to think of as family.

"Revenge. . Tell me . . Tell me who killed Suitengu. . Point me at them so I may rend their flesh from their bones, So I may paint the ground with their blood. . So I may make them PAY for their crime against me!"* - Thu Oct  8 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt none of her anger drain from within her, in fact she felt it only grow stronger. The brute did not know who had killed Suitengu, but he had hinted someone else in this village would. Her first impulse was to walk off and find them, that was, untill the brute spoke an interesting question. Was she strong enough? Indeed, a question she now had to ponder. She was strong, it was true, perhaps the strongest fan user of her generation, but Suitengu had been able to best her in each and every spar they ever had. Truthfully she had no idea if she were even close to strong enough. She put her hand upon her fan that rested upon her back, looking to the gaint of a man before she responded.

"I accept your challange!"

Her gaze fell upon the brute as she quickly assesed his readyness and without any hesitation swung the fan in a quick in a quick and brutal way, while jumping into the air. This did two things very quickly. 

First it sent a massive wall of wind, made up of a series of vaccum spaces made up of razor sharp wind, towards the brute of a man. This wall was massive, made up of her chakra and fuled by her rage and hurt. 

Second, It sent the young kunoichi flying backwards, allowing her to put distance between her and the brute. She could, if needed, fall about her fan and escape into the air from this postion, but for the time being allowed the burst of air to throw her backwards toward the cliff wall behind her.* - Thu Oct  8 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) didn't waste time trying to land upon her fan, instead she took a page right from the very brute she was fighting. She landed upon the ground with light thud and immidietly jumped backwards once more.She would carry on with her attack, in an almost relentless kind of way. She swung her fan, in a shockingly fast display of compentency with her weapon of choice, twice. She sent forth not a new wall of wind, as was her usual ploy in an attempt to knock her oppnnets back. This would prove pointless in this situation, as the man would clearly take something extra to knock off his feet. However the Kunoichi was undetered. 

The jutsu that flew forth was a barrage of cannon ball sized bullets of wind, roughly four per swing, all produced nearly at the same time and moving at shocking speeds. Each bullet seemed like a cannon ball, but on impact would cut like a knife thrown with a great amount of stregnth. All save three were thrown right into the charging brutes path, leaveing one on otherside of the brutes exit paths and one above, incase he choose to try and jump out of the way. 

With that done, and the swing bringing her fan back towards her she would, if fate allowed and she was able to time it, slip the fan underneath her body and mount it like a surf board, taking to the skies and hopefuly taking her out of the path of the brute and his meneceing hammer and brutal strength.* - Thu Oct  8 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) felt her anger bubbleing in her body, urgeing her forward. Her rage was like a drug she had never tasted before, and likely would never live without again. She felt the shift in the air as the man, nay the animal, missed her fan by mear inches and fell to the earth with a Titanic crash. This, though, was the moment she had been waiting for. She had flown up, and the moment the man crash had stopped her ascent to flip off her fan. She called upon her second chakra nature, though untrained in its use she was versed enough to utilize it at a great cose to her chakra. Red flames arose across the fan, embeleishing it with the fire of her once great and long forgotten clan, though she herself knew nothing of that ancent history. 

With a flick of her wirst, and a savaged scream of unbrideled fury, rage, sorrow and maybe, just a little bit of intoxicated joy at the battle lust she had thrown herself willingly into, she swung her fan twice, Sending forth two blade of wind, each themselfs long enough to cut down a chunk of forest, and wide enough to several man at once, foward, only to have the flames upon the fan ignite them into a huge burning X in the sky, rocketing down towards the cratered behemoth. 

This done she would catch herelf with a practeced snap of her wirst and float, just within the brutes range of jumping, to see if she had infact landed a winning blow.* - Thu Oct  8 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the man get up again, this monster was testing the last of her of already worn nerves, however, his jump would most deffiently put him in contact with her fan. She had made the mistake of not gaining proper distance from her opponent, and thus he was able to grasp onto her fan's edges. However, the resourcefull kunoichi was not without a plan of recourse. Her rage and anger bubbled within her as she did something incrediably stupid. 

The brute would already be tipping her fan, and so she flipped backwards, grasping the handhold of the fan and let the fan's new momentum carry it into a swing, and all the while threw her chakra into the weapon. What this would produce would be a wall of wind, much more powerful in it's concussive force then anything before, and all of it would be aimed for the hulk like man, right in it's path. 

The goal was a simple one, A huge man, no matter how durable, would feel some measure of pain from an unplanned impact, and she fully intended to make him get intimate with the terra firma below. Her mind focused on the name of her jutsu within her head. "Wind style: Great breakthrough"* - Thu Oct  8 09:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the gaint go flying, and with it her fan. The herculine man-beast flung her fan as he fell beneath the onslaught of her jutsu. She had to make a snap choice and made it. Her rage consumed mind refuseing to let her let up on this spar to prove her worth, though it was rapidly becomeing appernt to the girl, it was well past the time that she needed to begin training her body as well as her ninjutsu. Her hand flew into a pouch and withdrew from within it a kunai, an explodeing tag attached to it, and threw it toward the crator as she fell, before she as well tumbled to the ground. Her impact was less. . well impacting then the man-beasts, her natural reaction to the landing was to tuck into a ball and roll out of it. 

She shot up, likely faster then the brute did, and formed five handsigns as she rushed forward. Seemingly ready to engage in combat. Though in fact chakra now ran throughout her clothing, the full outfit she wore at all times. Though it looked to be functional battle armor from afar, it was infact nothing more then padded cloth, dismal in any real combat, but perfect for the jutsu she was now employing. * - Thu Oct  8 10:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the behemoth close in rapidly. She had seen this technique once before, almsot ten years prior. She knew now she would be in for alot of ouch if that man-beast manaaged to connect with her. Luckily, the earlier thrown kunai has been put into play for just that reason. As the beheamoth rushed forward, the kunai imbedded in the ground went off, nothing major, only changeing the landscape as the behemoth came near her. It would not buy her much time, but just enough to finish the handsigns she had been attempting.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Misa Misharna is able to summon snake(s) from within her clothes or person.  These small snakes carry small amounts of medical chakra inside them.  The snakes are then able to bite once, releasing a mixture of said medical chakra and small traces of non-potent venom into their target to act as a strong numbing agent as well as a pain killer.  If more than than three bites occur on a single target, they can suffer some health problems.

[Three Handseals.]
[Amount of Snakes = Mastery Level]

***
Chakra Drain: 79.1016 / Skill Rank: Mastered / Jutsu Rank: C / Element: Elementless 

Misa would have used the Jutsu to throw the girl across the room. The bites would sure cause deep wounds causing her to bleed. Misa began to huff and puff, trying to regulate her breathing after witnessing what she believed to be an assassination by the girl. "Heiwa...please....check to see if the Kage is breathing...he...he can't be gone." she stated making her way towards the previously attacked girl. She formed three handseals before allowing four snakes to coil out of her sleeve appearing almost like an alien-like hand over her own. The snakes themselves were white in nature, with beady black eyes. Without hesitating, the four snakes would fly out towards the girl in an attempt to bite onto her body, their fangs being able to break through simple clothing.

If successful, she would surely fall into a comatose state seeing as how the medical chakra and venom inside each snake would cause an adverse reaction within the girl causing her to painlessly fallinto this state. *We...We can deal with you...later.* she thought turning back to the boy and her lord.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shuddered as more water was put before her, the seal upon her body forceing her to drink, even agasint her consent. She would swallow the water, before returning to her usual state, though her breathing would begin to strengthen. She was faintly aware that she was not dead, floating somewhere within the deep recesses of her mind. She was in massive pain, she knew more then anything she would hate herself when she awoke. This did not make the propect a happy one. She wondered vaugly if she could just let the pain consume her.

It was then the other primairy feeling within her mind began to flare. Anger, deep and bright. She was filled with rage, the rage of loseing all that she had held dear to her. She knew she had to fight, that to die without any attempt to twarts it's ever steady scythe would be an insult to those she had sworn to gain vengence for. Erebus, Suitengu, and now even the Raikage, Niza. She would struggle to awaken, mentally walking toward the wall of pain the signled the waking world and what she knew would be an almost unbearable amount of pain. * - Fri Oct  9 06:46:11 2015

As soon as she was done drinking she awoke, and screamed like a banshee. Her whole body burned as if she were on fire. The various drugs, chakra, and what not in her system doing whatever they were intended to do. She could barley fathom the amount of pain she was in currently. The scream, however, was short lived, as it went from a scream to a steady series of painful grunts. She was trying hard to maintain her dignity, though truth be told, she likely didn't have much of that at the present moment.* - Fri Oct  9 07:03:15 2015

"I am. . Marrisa. If it is my life that I owe you. . . . Grah. . Then I vow to never forget that debt. . T..T...Tell My Att...Att.. Attacker I'm sorry. . "

She finally managed, then flopped back onto the bed, hoping intensely that the pain in her body would begin to die down soon. She made another vow, a silent vow, to get stronger, so this would never happen again. She had to be stronger, so she could avenge Suitengu, Erebus, and now even Niza.* - Fri Oct  9 07:30:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) turned her head to look upon the man who had thusly challanged her. She twitched and in one swift movement, removed the fan from her back. She knew better then to treat these kinds of challanges lightly. She would stand, fan raised but not yet swung, and speak.

"What do I win, If I live, other then my life of course?"

She asked, already calling upon her chakra, pushing it slowly into her fan but not yet unleashing it.* - Mon Oct 12 17:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked and let fire creep onto her fan. It blazed red like the fury that spurned her to get stronger. She would nod to him and then sigh.

"If you feel as though we must do this, then I accept. . Though I'll donate the money to Kumo's restoration funds."

She said as she waited to see if the now flameing fan would do anything to cause her opponent to move into action.* - Mon Oct 12 17:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) had some reservations about attacking first, She didn't like to think he was just some kid with a death wish, however this was an offical duel and she would not insult her opponet any longer. She would suddnely swing her fan, sending forth a wall of fire, utilizeing the flames upon the fan and her own Fuuton techique. The production would be a tornado of fire aimed for the gargoyle and it's master.* - Mon Oct 12 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the boy rush forward, a pretty dumb thing to do. She would run backwards as she shruged and swings her fan, Her training with it making this as simple as swinging her arm. The fire upon her fan would flicker out as she would inact her most used jutsu. The sickle weasel Technique. The coming gale would produce a cyclone to catch the opponent in and lift him into the air, cutting his body through the blades produced from the jutsu. Her eyes never left him, always ready to change her plans, if the situation called for it.* - Mon Oct 12 18:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) stopped her motions at this point. She couldn't kill someone who was so obviously defensless, even if he had tried to kill her. She would cut her chakra flow to her jutsu and let him land where he would. If he lived he lived, if the fall killed him, he got what he obviously wanted. She felt bad enough as it was over the whole ordeal. She would watch for the outcome.

"Why does eveyone try to kill me lately?" 

She asked aloud, mostly to Maloth. * - Mon Oct 12 18:14:24 2015
