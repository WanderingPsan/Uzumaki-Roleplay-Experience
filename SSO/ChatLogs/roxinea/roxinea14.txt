<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) inhales softly and reaches up, pulling her goggles off of her head. Her black eyes now visable for the first time since her return from the island. She would regard both of them neturally. The normally warm feeling the eminated from her was still there, but it was tinged by something else. She would exhale and allow her chakra to flow into her eyes, turning them from black to red with two black tome upon their surface.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched them both and slowly slipped her goggles back upon her face, obsureing the dojutsu from sight. She would inhale once more then exhale. Looking over both she would begin to speak.

"My eyes awoke while I was in the labaryinth. While I was fighting for my life, I came to a point where I was pretty sure I was going to die. So I accpeted it. Just as I had been making myself accept all that was wrong with the world. . The good and the bad, and my place in it all. . They came to me then. . Assisting in my defeat of my foe. .

She finished, allowing the flow of chakra to be cut and the sharingan to fad back into obscurity

"I need you both to swear to tell no one about them. . or how I achived this. . I have chosen only to share with the both of you.. Not even Fuji Sensei knows the full spacfics of how I came to attain my new occular prowess. . "* - Sat Oct 31 05:04:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) stood still as she watched the ongoing spar. She would smile and form a single handsign, whice was the boar. She would let her chakra fill her body before rushing out of her into the ground. After a few moments a mud Marrisa would raise from nothingness. 

The clone would form it's own handsigns, causeing the dirt infront of it to shift suddenly as a wall of earth shot up out of the ground, forming a barrier of earth to stop no attack in paticular. The clone was clearly utlizeing a move on behalf of it's castor!

Marrisa would form a series of handsigns, createing the earth near the wall erected by the clone to shift suddenly. After a few moments, the earth would erupt forward and create a small carvern. This jutsu would likely be utilized in real battle through the use of trying to detain an enemy! With this all said and done, she would relax her chakra, allowing it to return the earth to it's normal postion and the clone to fade.* - Sat Oct 31 06:50:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) formed the bird sign, then thruts her hands forward, createing several tornadoes of air that would race across the ground towards Hassan.* - Sat Oct 31 08:49:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) pulled her fan off her back and held it before her. She would close her eyes for a moment before pushing her chakra into it, alighting it with fire. She would pause for a moment and then swing her fan with a fair amount of strength! She was glad neither of these jutsu required handsigns, and thus enabled her to do such an action without alot of training. She would unlease the great breakthough technique, allowing it to mingle with the flames coming off of her fan to become a small wave of fire that rushed into the air then dissapaited.* - Sat Oct 31 08:55:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) nodded and backed up a few steps as she viewed her surroundings. She would close her eyes and form four fingers forward, wrapping her thumb back as she extended her hand slightly forward. Her body pitched slightly forward. 

She would then lunge forward in a sudden burst of movement, lungeing with all her body and stabbing her arm forward. The aim to impale an inviable target with her four fingers. She might have thought this looked silly for anyone else, but she knew Hassan had his reason's for everything he did.* - Sat Oct 31 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: No, your arm was wide. - Sat Oct 31 10:01:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You can't hit anything with your eyes closed. - Sat Oct 31 10:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) Opened her eyes, allowing her chakra to flow into them. She would be thankful for the tinted goggles she wore. No one would know unless they could sense the pin-point blossom of chakra she had the Dojutsu. She would relax and once more get into the earlier postion.

She would bring her arm in close, reforming the earlier postioning with her fingers. Once more her thumb wrapped around her fingers. She would shift her weight as she thusted her hand forward, her hips swiveling as she did. Aiming to once more impale an opponenet she could not see. She was eager to impress the Kazekage. * - Sat Oct 31 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) intook a breath as she returned to the netural starting postion for the jutsu. She woudl refine her stance a bit more, aiming to fully perfect the stance as he sought. She was a bit of a perfection nut her self. She was one who did not slough on her elemental training, espessicly when it came to wind training! She had a goal, and it would be met!

She would begin to focus as much chakra onto her hand as possible. Allowiing it to gather there in a lump sum. She was a tense but fluid as she felt the rush of power gorw. Once she felt she had amassed anough chakra she would push it into the next level.

The chakra would begin to vibrate agasint itself, growing sharper and sharper with each passing moment. The girl would level her breathing as her body began to relax with the feeling of chakra in her hand. She would look to Hassan for instruction of if she was doing good or bad, or for further instructions.* - Sat Oct 31 10:16:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I leave when I get good relations with both sages. - Sat Oct 31 10:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Right now, I can only summon only one of them. - Sat Oct 31 10:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Right. - Sat Oct 31 10:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Well do whatever you have to do. - Sat Oct 31 10:23:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: What's up. - Sat Oct 31 10:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Take care of Kilm, Chappie. - Sat Oct 31 10:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) listened intently to what Hassan told her of what she should be doing. She would nod and let the chakra go and begin once more, as he had earlier instructed. She woudl have to make this work! She was determined to be a member of sunagakure that impressed her leader! She would steady her body and return to a netural postion before she readyed herself for another go.

She would alowly shift her body into the the correcy base starting postion for the jutsu. Her body already gorwing accustom to it's useage. She would bring her arm in close and look ahead at the dead tree, pictureing her goal. She would have to do it this time. 

Now she would begin to gather the chakra that would be needed for the jutsu. She would call upon the chakra within her body, allowing it to flow up from her center of gravity into her lungs where it would mix with her wind element to become the wind element chakra she would be needing to properly utilize the jutsu.

The next step would be pooling it into her hand. This porcess would take quite a bit longer, as it was something she had never done before. The chakra would gather slowly at first, gathering on her fingers before begining to expand slowly into a lengthy albiet soft edged blade of wind chakra.

The previous step acomplished, she would begin to gather up her focus, her mind wanting to move towards Kilm, and his impressice Racoon summoning. She could not afford to be distracted here however. This was far to impotant to her and her desire to be the greatest wind ninja alive. She would surpass them all, even Hassan.

Her focus would now be one hundred percent focused on the task at hand. Her mind once more retrearting to her inner place of peace, all here brain power focused on the blade of wind in her hand. The blade whice was now rapidly begining to expand, the sound of wind grinding on wind could be heard to those sensitve enough to hear it.

Now She would be locked onto the tree infront of her, and her focus would be the punching of a hole in it's bark. She woudl begin to move forward, one step at a time at first. Her mind and body getting used to the feeling of the chakra in her hands. The way it fought agasint her as wind nature elements tended to do. She would then nod and take a few steps back. Returning to her start postion. Ready to give it a go. 

Her sharingan empowered eyes would now begin to plot her course carefully and comepltely. She would take into account each rock and twig in her way all the while maintaing her focus on the blade of wind chakra she was still forming in her hands.

 It was at this moment that a flare of doubt entered her head. Causeing the blade to falter and then return to it's normal gathering of dull wind chakra. She would look upon it and sigh, returning to the starting postion, letting the wind chakra go completlety. She had fucked up, and thus she woudl need to start over once more, as Hassan has insructed her.

She would then start the process over once more, as she had been shown from earlier, though her resolve could be seen in her each and every moment. Her desire to improve radiating off of her in waves. She was ready to show she could do this!

She would once more shift into the now perfected stance, her arm coming in tight as she focused her eyes forward on the dead tree that was to be her target. She would once more go into the chakra gathering portion of her routine. This time it came much faster. forming into her hand with out much complaint or effort. 

She woudl then call upon the natural wind chakra from within her, allwoing it to mingle with the chakra she had gathered too her hand. IT would once more begin to sharpen and grow lengthend in her hand. Quickly takeing the shape of a sharpened sword that sprung from the four out stretched fingers of her palm. 

She would move now, brutally and suddenly, rushing forward towards the tree, to stop short fifteen feet from her target, letting the full lunge finally snap into motion, as she thrust her hand forward into the air, sending the blade of wind straight through the tree, punching a hold through it with ease. 

This acomplsihed she woudl finally let go of the gathered chakra and turn to regard Kilm and the new Raccoon Chappie. She woudl bow deeply to the Raccon. She woudl show an obvious respect to the sage, and to it's summoner.

"An honor to meet you, Sir Chappie of the Racoon tribe, I am honored to be before you. Oh grand one."* - Sat Oct 31 10:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled sotly and took the offered cup of tea as she looked at the Racoon. she would cock her head softly as she spoke once more.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sat down upon the ground, relaxing the chakra in her eyes so they could revert. She would look upon the hole she had created with a sense of pride and admiration. She was happy she had managed at least this much. She was well on her way, to suceeding Hassan as the Master of wind. She would sip from the cup of tea slowly, enjoying the flavor. She would then turn to look upon Kilm and Chooper.

"I am honored you enjoy being within Sunagakure, good Racoon. I thank you for the tea kind Chooper."* - Sat Oct 31 11:28:38 2015

She was, without a doubt, filled with hatred for the women, but none that anyone could outwardly see. Her aura of postive nature still radiated from her, she still obeyed the villages laws to the letter, as she always had.

"He is right. . Your father sounds like a nobel example of the Raccoon species."* - Sat Oct 31 14:32:06 2015

She would look pleadeingly to the sage for more. Anything to prevent her from haveing to speak on the subject of Katsune. Her face would also be notiably flush red. She was unused to Ortho being so public about his affection. It brought her great joy to see him as such.* - Sat Oct 31 15:32:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) looked up and cleared her throat.

"I won't be a part of this group if Katsune Joins it. I understand her claimed side of the altercation with Saeza that led to the death of my apprentice. I, however, do not believe a shinobi who once claimed the title of Hokage unable to defeat a mere Genin without killing her. Not to mention her continued attempt to goad me into open conflict in the square. I will not harm Katsune unless it becomes an order from my lord Kazekage, on that you have my word, and if you know anything about me, you know this to mean it shall not be broken.
