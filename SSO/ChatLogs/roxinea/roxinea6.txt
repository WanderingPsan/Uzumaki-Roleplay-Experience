<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) cursed lightly and did something stupid. Her body moved on it's own as she ripped a portion of her robes off. She would, if able to get past the chakra cloak, pull the Kunai from within his flesh. Her mind working on over drive. 

"Mokutsu! Damn it! get ahold of yourelf! I came like I promised! Be strong! Whatever this is, contain it! Yourr stronger then this!"

She called out, while trying to wrap the cloath around the wound, showing him he had at least her as a friend.* - Fri Oct 16 07:21:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) tumbled into her teachers arms, only to quickly recover, not in a mood to piss of Zenkai. She would place the passed out shinobi upon the ground and lightly move his hair away from his face while she spoke aloud. 

"I knew you could do it. . I am proud of you." 

She would then show his wound to Lyan, then stand and walk back to Saeza.

"Sorry about all this. . He said he needed to talk to me. . "* - Fri Oct 16 07:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) took off her fan. setting it into the dirt. free of the weight for the first time in quite a while, she gave a wide smile. She pulled on a pair of black gloves, being a tailor, she had made herself some taijutsu gloves along time ago. She would roll her shoulders then drop into a basic taijutsu stance. Though she had no real training in the type of combat, it was clear from her stance she had the basics down pat.* - Fri Oct 16 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked and didi something she had never done before. She rushed forward, trying to intercept the girl as she came at her, throwing a few well broad punches for the girls shoulders. Nothing major, just a one two punch combo to start things off.* - Fri Oct 16 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was countered quite thusly, her fist's colideing with the other girls. A brief look of shock flashed across her own face. She had rarely seen anyone able to attack to rapidly. This did not disuade her however. Suitengu's words flowing through her mind. 

"You won't imporve if you give up. . Fight it out. . one one lesson in victory, but a dozen in loss."

She redoubled her effoerts now. Putting on speed and relaying on her relfexes as she let herself go the urge to fight. Not out of anger but out of a moment of Zen, of letting go of concerns and stress and fear. She wanted to improve. Her body would seem to jump backwards, as if to gain distance between them, but quickly rushed forward once more, aiming to send in several punches, aimed for her arms and chest. She didn't have the same speed in her attacks as Saeza, but she had much better reflexes and natural speed at her disposal, so she hoped to land one or two weak hits on the other girls fram.* - Fri Oct 16 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was overjoyed that she had managed to land a hit, but then took a sudden blow to her jaw, causeing her to stumble backwards, before she was suddenly tripped and set tumbling the sand. Though she didn't stay there long, she would roll to the left and dash forward suddenly, throwing a faint towards her right shoulder, before bobing to the left and throwing a haymaker towards her chest.* - Fri Oct 16 08:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) was kicked in the chest and rapidly pinned. She woud actually be smieling, as she prepared a counter. She smile and whisper to Saeza. 

"Never forget the legs!"

With that said, she would buck her hips hard, hopfully sending the much smaller and lighter girl up as her left foot slew up to try and kick her solidly in the back, a trick she had seen a kick boxer do once, though it was up to fate on weather or not that worked out for her.* - Fri Oct 16 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) couldn't help but laugh, this girl was resourcful! She would utilize her own mometum started witht he kick and the momentum gained from MArissa's bucking to propell the kunoichi into the air. She would roll her body, laughing like an idiot as she did a small flip and landed in a heap upon the ground a short distance away, thankful for the sand being loosely packed as it was. She would quickly try to jump up and recover! * - Fri Oct 16 08:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) wobbles, but is less dizzy, She had practice moving around at high speeds, That shuinsin though. She smiled and sat down after retrieveing her fan. 

"Alright, now you both come here! I am going to teach you a few jutsu! Or rather, give you what you need to learn them!"* - Fri Oct 16 08:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Huh? Like what? - Fri Oct 16 08:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) pulled out several scrolls. Each was increidably detailed, but had precise step by step instructions how to do what was sealed within in deep black ink. It was clear from the writeings that Marissa had Mastered each jutsu and taken the time to sit down and transcirbe them to scrolls. 

"The first I am giveing you is Genjutsu:Kai! This jutsu will enable you to break free of enemy Genjutsu, provided you've a strong ernough mind to become aware you are within on. It can save your life." 

She intoned, 

"The second is a basic level Genjutsu, D rank, nothing hard, called Mist servant jutsu. It can create multiple copies of you, that are just illusions, and if used at night, or in a hevily wooded area agasint someone who dosn't have a Dojutsu, You can exaust your enemy by having them atttack the fakes!" * - Fri Oct 16 09:01:26 2015

"I will do you proud Sensei!"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sits down and starts to read both scrolls slowly, side by side, then looks up at Reguel.

"I'll let you read them when I am done. . Got anything you can share?"

She asked with a bright and happy smile. She exuded that feeling, though nothing perk related, she was just a happy girl!* - Fri Oct 16 10:12:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Alright, cool. - Fri Oct 16 10:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sat cross legged upon the ground and smiled, hands going through handsigns then pauseing for a moment. She seemed to be practiceing the Demonic illusion jutsu she had just learned, though without putting it into practical application. Her head seemed to bob to a tune only she could hear.* - Fri Oct 16 10:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: so. . You missed some excitement today. . Turns out we have another Biju host among us. .  - Fri Oct 16 10:48:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) continues to form the handsigns while sitting cross legged upon the ground. Then stopped, smacking her forehead, and formed the Ram handsign. In a flash of motion and white smoke there were now four Marrisa's sitting beside the origanle. Each of them would begin to form the handsigns as well, commiting the technique to memory.* - Fri Oct 16 11:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled, as she was raidly becomeing acustom to the jutsu. She loved the feeling of acomplsment she got from mastering jutsu, creeping herself slowly toward becomeing a shinobi worth being talked about in the future. She and her four clones would continue to practice the jutsu, Their hands moving slowly through the process of how the jutsu would be performed.* - Fri Oct 16 11:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) waves at Mira from her lazy postion on the ground, ot at least one of the five of her did. Whice caused each of the other five Marrisa's to turn and smile and wave at her as well. 

"Hello Mira! Wanna join us? Were just practicing jutsu! I'll even teach you a few genjutsu, if you promise to teach me something new in return!"

She called out.* - Fri Oct 16 11:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) giggles and nods as her clones continue to form handsigns. Each one stood up one by one then walked off, Each facing south, then would suddenly breath out a combined collection of green gast. The main Marissa would suddenly pick up a rockl, Focusing her fire nature chakra into it, before flinging it into the gas, Causeing it to explode , tearing the clones appart in the process. 

"Yes, It's my main form of attack, but I am picking up everything I can. . Relaying soley on my fan will get me killed." 

She said simply, but in a respectful way. It was clear this meant nothing offensive in how she talked, she seemed to OOZE happiness, though it was not perk related, she was just a happy person, and it was kind of infectious.* - Fri Oct 16 11:29:04 2015

"Hold on. . Someone is talking to one of my clones. . Please excuse me for a moment?" 

She said as she tried to focus her chakra from such a long distance, So she could find out what was needed of her in the mist.* - Fri Oct 16 11:36:44 2015

"I recall your fellow shinobi holding back knowladge from you. . So I brought you some of your own scrols."* - Fri Oct 16 11:44:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) pulls her fan off her back and walks forward, carefully scanning the ground for anything that might seem red or out of place. She was in a unique mood, having been poisened before, this mission sent her on edge in rapid manner. She would try to keep pace with the misson lead Katsune.* - Fri Oct 16 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Wyn - Fri Oct 16 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: why* - Fri Oct 16 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sat cross legged and formed the ram sign, Katsune had the right idea. Clones were the right way to go! She would summon forth a shadow clone who took off at impresive speeds toward the dome. Her use of Sumion was evident as she scaled the dome with ease and grace. Upon reaching the top she would look around for any escapes, then shurgged. 

She watched the otherr kunoichi do her mud thing. She smiled and began to exude an aura od happiness, like she usuaally did. She just enjoyed seeing her allies do well is all. She did not have a perk to support this action, but it was there none the less, but easily ignored. Her hands grassped her fan from her back and prepared herself, coating the fan in fire as she pulled it back for a massive swing. 

The next movement was one of a well practiced sort. She weung her fan while channleing her fuuton chakra into it's surface. In a blur of wind and fire a tornado of fire decended into the dome that Katsune had made. It's intent? To pop those suckers lile the arachnids they were. This would cause the Kunoichi to step back for a moment, her fan already coming back to be swung again. 

The sounds of scorpions screaming and poping from the wind and heat could be heard, before the kunoichi swung her fan once more. A new technique was sent into the dome. A cyclone of wind, createing pockets of air within it's that would suck up any straggler within the dome and reduce them to finely diced scropion chunks. * - Fri Oct 16 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) grinned and pulled her fan back once more. She servayed the domes insides and nodded at the eradication of the the scropions within she would then turn her attention to the ground. 

Quickly jumping into the air, she would ride her fan a little ways, untill she found another group of scropions. She would then roll off her fan in mid air and swing it with all her might. 

The resulting wind jutsu would slam all the scropions in the area down flat, easily crushing their bodies with the pressure and power of the wind. The sounds of scropions poping like popcorn could be heard throughout the battlefield. This would likely cause several more Susumus's.

The clone would land upon the ground and survay everything around it. Everything was handled and so, with a deep bow as if saying goodbye to a crowed, it would explode into a plume of white smoke. 

The real marrisa watched from her seated spot in safety, a deep sigh escapeing from within her lungs. Susumu had used a jutsu that would have, in normal situations, caused great pains to an AoE shinobi like herself. If she had harmed him she might even have been a bit miffed.* - Fri Oct 16 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) grinned as she watched the chaos unfold on the battlefield. It was kind of unfortunnate really. She would stand slowly make her way forward through the crowed of dead scropion bodies and the like. She would have her fan in her hands ready to attack when the moment called for it. She was sure they were about done here. 

She would spot a small group of still living Scropions, scuttling around confused at the loss of the Susumu they had been attacking. She would swing her fan in one rapid snap like motion. Her fuuton element being molded once more to cause several bullets of wind to fly forward. Each would punch through a scropion like they were made of paper mache.

That done she would continue forward, looking toward Katsune with a goofy smile and a happy look on her face. She loved being useful to her village, and enjoyed the feeling of sucesess even more now that she was doing so in a group. She would stand next to the real Katsune, waiting for more orders. * - Fri Oct 16 22:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) pulled her fan off her back and held it open in front of her. Her whole demenor changeing in an instant. Her fal would erupt in flames as she did so. She would not attack right away, but kept a close eye on the boy before her. He used paper like that one girl, so Marrisa wanted to see what his first move would be compared to the others. She had senselessly turned her body to paper to combat a fan user, it would be ineresting to see what Ai did diffrently.* - Fri Oct 16 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) swung her fan suddenly and completely. She held no notions of holding back on this ninja. Without much concern a wall of wind, tinged with fire, erupted forward. IT would suddenly ignite into a full blown typhoon of swirling fire and wind as it smashed it's way forward. The goal? Incerneate the paper or at the very least knock it back towards it's creator. The attack was on a huge scale, made to hit alot of ground and cause massive damage when able! * - Fri Oct 16 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked, lookined over the girl, wondering why she had not tried to dodge or even use her papers to defend herself. Perhaps she had gone to hard afterall? She would extingush the flames on her fan and hold it open and aloft, watching for Ai's movements. She wasn't going to attack the othe other shinobi why they might be on the ground. Of course, if they had mangaed to keep standing, another swing of fan would produce a series of three small tornadoes aimed at Ai, meant to further press her into defense and use up chakra to defend herself, provided Ai didn't end the spar, if she did, the swing would never come.* - Sat Oct 17 00:17:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Good! Start us off then!~ - Sat Oct 17 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sheugged and took off her fan. Nina usually wanted to spar with their fists. She would roll her shoulders then suddenly rush forward, Aiming to send a rapid set of kicks toward the girl, one up high, that was meant as a faint, and a second that came even faster towards her chest/stomach area. These kicks would hurt and wind, but they lacked much power beyond that.* - Sat Oct 17 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) hopped back a few steps, she knew for a fact her kicks lacked any real stregnth behind them. The most damage Nina would have received was a light bruse on her arms and some minor pain. Marissa was not experinced in taijutsu, nor the jutsu she had just used. So it only made sense to actually put effort into it when her opponenet actually knew a form of hand to hand combat.* - Sat Oct 17 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched Nina rush forward. This was an intreresting move. seems the girl wasn't going to give up without a fight. Marrisa was happy to oblige. She didn't around however, she would rush forward to meet nina's charge, altering her intentions no doubt, as she used her superiour speed and reflexes to her advantage. She would abrubtly stop and throw a faint punch for the girls chest, then drop into a low spin kick, aimed to knock the girl off her fett. 

Marrisa was not going to hold back in this paticular spar. An important lesson for every shinobi is to know your limitations, and Nina seemed to be over zealous in her attidude, at least that's how Marrisa saw it as of late. She wanted to help the younger girl blossom into a fine and strong Kunoichi.* - Sat Oct 17 02:22:30 2015
