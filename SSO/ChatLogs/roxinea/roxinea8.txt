<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You're free to watch if you like - Tue Oct 20 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the shinonbi leader throw shuriken. She was not a sensory ninja, and so could nod have known he was channleing wind nature chakra intro the weapons, but this would not have changed her intentions either way. She would quickly clap her hands together as she chalnnled her chakra. Should this work without any issue, it would produce a large shot of wind that shot forward, hopefully knocking the Shuriken out of the air, as it barrled it's way toward Hassan. 

Should this prove wrong, She would likely be in for a world of hurt as each of the bladed weapons found their mark. * - Tue Oct 20 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) tried her best to follow the superieor Shinobi. She had trained her eyesight for this very reason, to contend with shinobi who moved faster then the normal eye could see. She would wait for the right moment to inact her next response. She would quicly shift her body, as the impalement came, and clap once more, at close range. Her intention was to shift her leg just enough that the forward momentum from the incoming attack would force him to at least continue a forward movement, or even stumble. Her chakra once more molded into the response. Her goal with the jutsu to cause minor bruseing and maybe even wind the Kazekage.* - Tue Oct 20 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) stared openly at her leader. A look of utter joy mixed with jealousy crossing her face. She suddenly tensed and jumped back, while simutainously bringing her fan out, flipping it open and swinging it with all her might in one fluid motion. She  would someday ask Hassan to teach her that jutsu, even if she knew he would likely tell her no. It was not a dream to have it herself. 

The fan, if it had sucsessfully managed to complete it's swing and cast it's jutsu, would produce a gale force wind, filled with pockets of vaccume space vfilled with cutting razor like wind. She would not be able to hold back agasint the man who called himself the Kazekage.* - Tue Oct 20 19:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched the kage move with impressive speeds and manuvriability. He was not a leader for nothing she supposed. Not to mention that blade he had conjured looked painful as fuck, should it be visable, and if not, she would continue with her actions regardles. She would jump back once more, moving toward's the back wall. Gaining distance between her and the kazekage.She would focus her fire chakra onto her Fan, allowing it to become covered with the nature element. She would then focus her her whole attention on the kage. She was not sure if he could merge his new speed wiith the Shunshin jutsu, but she had to be preapred. She would mantain the flames, but not yet use any thing aggresive towards him, mostly from the lack of ability to do so  without  putting her into a obvious attack area. * - Tue Oct 20 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm.. - Tue Oct 20 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked and he was gone. Her whole world seemed to slow down once more as a great many things moved through her mind. However the only prominet thought was a bright happy feeling that filled her with joy. She was sparring her Kazekage, and she had not lost in a single move with him at sixty percent. This would forever be a triumph for her. 

Then the blast of air hit her like a cannonshot. Sending her frame tumbling across the sand, where she would end up face down in the dirt, Dazed and confused at how he had mamahed such explosive wind force. unless he had aimed to slam her into the wall, in whice was the sound of flesh meeting rock would ring throughout the training field, as her body would colide with the rock face then fall, passed out, to land with a thud into the sand.* - Tue Oct 20 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) had been trying to stand when Hassan had invited her to end the spar. She opened her mouth, as if to answer, but then closed it for a moment. Her head was spinning. She would shake her head, as if to answer no. She could still continue, though it may be an obvious mistake. Then she sighed and spoke.

"Yes, I give up. Thank you for the spar Lord Kazekage."* - Tue Oct 20 20:29:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: So, To train yourself in Wind training. .We will start with something simple. - Tue Oct 20 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) pulls out a small handfull of leaves, They were green and healthy, she would offer them to Index. 

"We will start by getting you familure with working your chakra into the wind element. Focus your chakra into the leaf with the intent to cut it down the middle, as I shall demonstrait."

With that said she would hold up a leaf and show him it was whole. Then she would focus her chakra into the leaf and channle her wind chakra, causeing the leaf to split down the middle.

"Once you are able to do that, I will begin teaching you a few wind Jutsu, untill you can activly manipulate the wind nature."* - Tue Oct 20 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) nodded to him with a smile and sat cross legged upon the ground, offering him a small sip of her water. 

"Very good Index! Now, I will show you a D rank Wind jutsu, it is called Divine wind, and then I will give you a scroll on the jutsu to study. Once you feel like you understand it, I'll give you anotrher." 

She said simply before forming a single handsign and molding her wind chakra into her palms and thusting them forward, createing a decent rush of pressured wind that flew rapidly across the sand, leaveing a small trench. The jutsu drained little from her, having mastered it quite a while ago in her life. 

With the demonstration done she would pass the aformentioned scroll to him from a pouch she kept at her waist. It was marked "Divine Wind" And contained the detailed information of the jutsu. Little helpful notes were added where ever the scholerly like kunoichi could fit them. * - Wed Oct 21 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You are doing great Index! You are getting ahold of this very quickly. I only have C rank jutsu to teach from here on. . So it's going to be a little tougher. - Wed Oct 21 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's fine I have time. - Wed Oct 21 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Well let me know when you are ready to move on. - Wed Oct 21 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I am, if you are. - Wed Oct 21 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: alright - Wed Oct 21 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) pulls out another scroll. This was one of her current favorites. She would speak aloud from memory a passage within the scroll.

"Wind styke: Gale palm. C rank, A simple technique that when the user's hands are clapped together, Wind is compressed and transformed into a powerful gale. This jutsu is one of my favorites, and is very versitile. It can rebound enemy attacks and send them right back, should they come in the form of a thrown weapon."

She would then toss him the scroll before summoning up her Wind Chakra from within her body and then clapping, Sending a new burst of wind out into the desert. This one held much more force and carved a much deeper trench in the sand then the one before it. It was easy to see how useful a jutsu you only had to clap to activate would be.* - Wed Oct 21 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) clapped for Index and then seemed to mull a few things over. He was learning at a suprisingly fast rate, She decided to simply sit back and watch him blossom as she now pulled out several more scrolls. She was not sure how much Chakra he had avliable to him, but she figured he would be alright for learning the basics of each ability.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) nodded as she stood, dusting herself off as she did so. She would smile to Index. He was certinely a hard worker. She would stretch lightly as she spoke to him.

"You are doing fantastic Index. . Show me your progress once you have it all down." 

She said simply* - Wed Oct 21 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shrugged and opened her arms. She held as always a pleasnt aura around her. 

"Go for it"* - Wed Oct 21 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled warmly and hugged Index back. Freely giving him a hg and trying to share with him some of the happy emotions she lived her life around. After the hug was finished, she would allow him to scurry if he so chose. * - Wed Oct 21 01:11:40 2015

"The Shunshin No Jutsu, A technique wherein the user exerts chara into their body, increaseing a metabolic rate, that allows them to cover a certain distance in a short period of time."

"The prize one pays for this ability is that that tend to become dizzy after. . Unless they put a great deal into mastering the jutsu. (Ex. Getting flicker Fighter Perk )

"I want it back when you are done with it."* - Wed Oct 21 03:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled and pulls out several freshly cut leaves. The sun of sunagakure already doing it's work and starting to dry them out. She would hand three to each shinobi before holding on up herself. 

"What you are going to be doing. . Is calling upon the wind chakra, located in your lungs, and useing it to cut your leafs."

She spoke aloud before demonstraiting with her own chakra. Eaisly cutting the leaf.

"Once you have that down, I'll put you both to work on getting jutsu down."* - Wed Oct 21 04:56:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mmm, right. - Wed Oct 21 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) tosses Iza a scroll. It was a detailed how to guide on the art of flowing Wind into a tool. She would grin and offer Saeza a leaf. 

"Same thing for you now Sae-Chan. . but You need to focus on lighting the leaf on fire with your chakra. The fire chakra is located in your stomach."* - Wed Oct 21 05:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Of course. I'll probably live long after you've died and I'll definitely remember you. - Wed Oct 21 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I'm sure you will be. - Wed Oct 21 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiles softly. A look of trouble passing her face before it too is gone. She would hand Hiroshi a scroll on Divine wind. Just as detailed as amutjomg else she would normally produce. Small helpfull notes in the margins were even included. She clearly had a flair for teaching and helping others imporve.* - Wed Oct 21 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) claps. She was very happy to see her students advanceing so quickly. Truely suna was blessed with a strong upcoming generation and vampires! She would turn to Izanami first and nod..

"Good! Here is another. . Work on it now. . Right now I am trying to get your mind wrapped around working with the element. The more you try, the more accustomed to the chakra nature you will become. This one is called Gale palm, I bet you'll like it." 

She said as she passed another scroll over to the young super star Kunoichi. It was just as detailed as before, only this one was more so. Little notes were added here and there that showed Marrisa was already quite fond of it. then she turned to Saeza. Suna's littlest Vampire.

"That's fantastic Saeza! I knew you'd be able to get the hang of this! Here is another one. This one is Chakra Flow: Fire. Again, I'll have you start here because you know what you are doing already, albiet in another element. "

Once more, a detailed scroll is provided. A warm and happy smile sat upon Marrisa's face. She was enjoying herself immensely right at this moment. Her mind falling back into her usual zen place. She was rapidly becoming one who could find relaxaztion easily. * - Wed Oct 21 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Alright.  .onto a harder one Hideo - Wed Oct 21 05:42:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: This one is called Wind style rotating shuriken - Wed Oct 21 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) she smiled and fished around her bag for another scroll. This one was bassicly brand new, written only recently but still as detailed as all the others. * - Wed Oct 21 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Happy to do it. .  - Wed Oct 21 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) grinned and clapped once more. 

"Fantastic! now we will mvoe onto another Jutsu! This one is a basic fire technique. IT is called Flame thrower."

She said before passing over yet another scroll. * - Wed Oct 21 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled and cracked her neck, forming four quick handsigns then extending her hands forward, cupped like the Kamhameha, and threw out a huge wall of wind that tore the sand apart like a collage freshman tearing open a virgin's legs at her first keger. She would grin and nod. 

"That is next. . It is called great breakthrough." 

And,you guessed it, she would hand him another scroll!* - Wed Oct 21 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) laughs and claps some more. She was on a roll tonight, and Saeza was on. . .snicker. . Fire! She would do a little jump before tossing her another scroll.

"Nect step! Fire ball! Same concept, only bigger!" * - Wed Oct 21 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: M'kay. - Wed Oct 21 06:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Yeah....I'd have to sire you...Then you'd have to kill me or break my control... - Wed Oct 21 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am pretty strong willed. . but uh. .  - Wed Oct 21 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I'd rather not join the Fang association just yet. .  - Wed Oct 21 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: No offense intended. . but I can't see myself sucking blood. - Wed Oct 21 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Let's get harder 'Risa! I know you have some powerful techniques hidden up your sleeve! - Wed Oct 21 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiles and looked at both the indiivudals present. She wanted to teach them both one of her best jutsu, but she couldn't. Not without Fuji's permission. She smiled and shook her head.

"Sorry Saeza..  You'll have to stick with C ranks. . I don't have very many B ranks. . and the ones I do have. . I have made an oath not to give out without permission. I hope you can understand and forgive me"

She said before tossing the scroll for wind bullets to Hideo. It was just like the last ones, super detailed. She would grin, form her handsigns, then quickly blow out four bullets, aimed at a cactus, and blow holes clean through it. 

"That one is for you Hideo."

She said before turning to Saeza and pulling out one of her new favortie fire jutsu. It was called Misty flames Jutsu. She would chuck her the scroll before forming a handsign, taking a deep breath and allowing her chakra to mix with the air she now had stored then let it all out in one large burst of green gas. Once it had all exited her lungs she would form another jutsu, snapping her fingers to create a spark and summon forth a ball of fire from her hands and throwing it into the cloud, causeing it to explode nicely.

"Fire Style: Misty flames. . This one is good. . and I'll teach you the one I used to light it once you get the hang of this one! Be careful though. . Don't breath in the gas once you have expelled it. . could get messy if any is in your lungs the next time you try to form a fire jutsu."* - Wed Oct 21 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) tosses another scroll to both of them with an even wider smile.

"I have never been so proud. . You both are doing amazing!"* - Wed Oct 21 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: It's all thanks to our wonderful teacher.~ - Wed Oct 21 07:06:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) thinks back to the fight at the village gates. The man who had solved agression though peace. She fealt a smile grow on her face. She would nod, but not before forming a handsign and summoning forward a shadow clone. It would sit where she normally would. This would allow those who needed her to still have accses to her, in some minor way. * - Wed Oct 21 08:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiles softly. 

"I could use a quite place for a little while. . I am thankful you came back for me, many have missed you. Though Iza grows at an amazing pace. She will be a Wind ninja to rivle me soon."* - Wed Oct 21 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sat corss legged and began to hum a soft tune, clearing her head as she had done a dozen or so times now. She often enjoyed her alone time with her Master. One of the few men she did not feel the need to be on defense around or nervous of. He had never given her reason to be. She woud sigh contently and speak alould to her master, but softly enough to be within reason within the temple.

"Thank you for picking me up Master. It has been a stress filled couple of days. It will be nice to relax. What are you reading on? Is it one of the nets for our fishing trip? How goes our preperation for that anyway?"* - Wed Oct 21 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) noded her head. Her focus split between a stray leaf and her Master. Shewould grin up at him and nod. 

"I am working on getting my Focus on advanceing my chakra pools and Mastry of the Wind element. This way I can start createing new and more powerful wind jutsu. Like a Variation of the Lord Kazekage's wind armor. .Though. . I am also working on a method to amplify my jutsu strength. . "

She finished, though he words were soft and clam as she embraced the natural softness of the enviroment around her.* - Wed Oct 21 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sat in her usual calm postion. Her mind was aloof as she listened to him speak to her, only barley registering where his hand had gone. She didn't see it for what he had done. In her mind she could trust Fuji with her life. She knew he woud never do anything to ender the trust that had grown between them. Her usual aura of pleasentness kicked in now as she spoke. 

"Nina left for the mist, but I think that may be for the best Master.. Though I myself has asked for teaching, I have alwats given it freely as well. So I think I understand what you mean."* - Wed Oct 21 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shook her head with a smile. She felt comfterable. Her body relaxing, letting the stress of a hard couple of days begin to seep out of her slowly. The air was doing wonders for her. Her mind would go over the various other people who had been prerssing her Master for Jutsu and sighed. She still had to teach Kilm about wind to get his help with Fire Style. She would shrug as his inquiry and finally speak once more.

"Do you think I have reason to do anything? You are my Master. . You would not do anything to destory the bond of trust we have built with one another. I have utter and complete faith in you."* - Wed Oct 21 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shurgged as she looked upon Fujitora with her light black, almost shoot black, irisis. She grinned and and nudged him softly. Her trust in him not even shaken. Though she was, now at least, a little worried about Zenkai. She knew she could likely defeat her in ranged combat, but something didn't sit well with Marrisa about fighting her. She would regard her master for a moment longer before finally responding. 

"I will continue to put my faith in you Master Fuji. I shall warn you if you ever stray into terretory best left for Zenkai. This conversation shall remain between you and I."* - Wed Oct 21 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) woke up with a yawn, pulling herself off the soft grass and stretchiing. She would wave to her teacher before returning to her Meditation mat. Her mind was abuz with a great many things, but she began to quite them down. Slowlwy her mind began to calm. Within her head she found her little island of Zen. All around her, the oceans of her mind were turbulent. She would wave her mental hand, causeing each section of the ocean to calm before she herself was sitting cross legged upon a sandy beach in the cetner of a large ocean.

Next she began to let go of a great many things that always seemed to try to gnaw at her soul. Her residual pain from the loss of Erebus. The anger, loss and hate she had for the loss of Suitengu. The fear of not being good enough. The supressed feelings of worthlessness and self doubt that had come from being soundly beaten by a medic in kumo when she was fasley accused of being Niza's murderer, and finally the newest stress of being a teacher. Though this was a happy stress, it was still something she had to try and push out of her mind. 

Now she let the good flow through her mind, not grabbing hold of any one memory but rather having them float through the ocean to give her peace. The meeting of Erebus, and his words of stern imporvement. The meeting of Suitengu and his amazing skills. The meeting of Fujitora, and the fact he saved her life. The meeting of Izaname, Saeza and even Hideo. Her new friends that she now watched progress so quickly. Each of them were now her students, and through them she found she was better herself. 

This brought upon the goal she was looking for, one she had replicated before. She fell into a moment of Zen. A calm moment where she simply basked in the pleasentness of life, and didn't let the other more negitive bits get to her. and in that she found something she had not previously found. She found acceptnce in her world. She had managed to life long enough to become a mentor and a powerful shinobi in her own right, and this caused her great calm. She was utterly at peace with herself, her life, and everything in it. A moment of the truest bliss.

She would hold herself in this manner. Simply allowing for herself to be swallowed up in this feeling.* - Wed Oct 21 18:56:38 2015

I'll go ahead and give you a scroll to study while I am out of town, This body having limited chakra, I can't afford to use it up in case someone needs me. Once you have managed to get the hang of the jutsu, go ahead and nudge me, and I'll help you with the next."
