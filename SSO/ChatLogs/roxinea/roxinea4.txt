<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: alright. .  - Wed Oct 14 12:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I'll try and fight hand to hand only then. .  - Wed Oct 14 12:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I need to train myself anyway! - Wed Oct 14 12:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Okay! Ortho starts since he didn't get any drawbacks!~ - Wed Oct 14 12:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..I'm not the Taijutsu person.. - Wed Oct 14 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Always time to learn Ortho my friend. Heh - Wed Oct 14 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Good, you get training for that too.~ - Wed Oct 14 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) wasn't about to take a cop out from ortho. She dipped low and threw a sudden punch for the man's gut. Though she lacked any real power to her punches, she was at least compatent in the use of basic Taijutsu, enough to dodge and react compatently. She would be throwing a right jab for the center of his abs, while calling out.

"No holding back! Kunoichi are ninja too!" 

She called out almost teasingly.* - Wed Oct 14 12:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shifted her body, weighed down by her fan she could not avoid the full blow, but she attempted to at least lessen the impact. She would take the blow, having lessened some of the force with her movement, then stumble back, looking to Ortho with a worried expression.

"Are you okay?!" 

She asked, cringing besides herself, She was decently strong in ninjutsu, but damn it she needed to learn to take a punch!* - Wed Oct 14 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shrugged and then looked around, noticing that Nina was gone. She would relax and smile. 

"So, What kind of training did you want to do Ortho?"* - Wed Oct 14 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Honestly..? I did a bit of training before I went to the village square. - Wed Oct 14 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Was going to just sit by myself and think. - Wed Oct 14 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: let me guess. .  - Wed Oct 14 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You wanna go out on a date? - Wed Oct 14 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I.. wasn't thinking that, but it doesn't sound bad. - Wed Oct 14 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: To me that is.. - Wed Oct 14 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I'd love some Ramen and Juice? - Wed Oct 14 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Consider it done. - Wed Oct 14 13:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) offered him her arm with a soft smile* - Wed Oct 14 13:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Lead the way. .  - Wed Oct 14 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: A gentlmen always escorts a lady - Wed Oct 14 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Wow. . You. . You must really like the Ramen here huh? - Wed Oct 14 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Better than Suna's. - Wed Oct 14 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I see. .  - Wed Oct 14 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I still think the flavor their ramen with sand. - Wed Oct 14 13:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) giggles soflty and takes a seat at once of thei tables.* - Wed Oct 14 13:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) smiled and made her order with the Chef, then turned her gaze back to Ortho.

"So. . You know all about me. . You questioned me throughly enough. . Tell me about you,"* - Wed Oct 14 13:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) nodded her head slightly as she listened to him speak. She shivered at the mention of Sake. She didn't drink it anymore, and woulden't untill she had avanaged Erebus in some manner. Her smile never faltered, and even as Orthos spoke she slipped into the recent center of peace that had come from a stable home, a talented master and a bright future. She bore a content and happy smile as she listened to the man speak of his past. 

"You have done well. . I'd like to someday pick up that skill of yours. Heh. .I am sure it would be useful. I adore your sister. She reminds me of a young. . Well. . Me. . hehe, I am sure she is going to grow up to be very strong, You can be proud of her."* - Wed Oct 14 13:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) watched his face as he spoke, her mind a small island in the middle of a clam ocean. She was truly relaxed for the first time since Erebus has taken her out. This somehow felt diffrent though. She was not on guard for sexual advances, or worried that one of Erebus's many friends or allies would whisk him away. It was just two friends chatting. She enjoyed it immenslely. So much so that she let even the ever present anger begin to slip from her mind, then vanish all togerther, chooseing just for the moment to enjoy this clam state of mind. 

"I will pass this message along to my Master. . And Nina. . As I have no place to question you choice. I would suggjest you talk this over with Master Fuji and Nina, at the same time before making a finale call. Younger siblings often don't know what they want untill it's too late to truely have them." 

She said as the Chef brought their orders to them to eat. She happily drank a large portion of her juice, a quilty pleasure.* - Wed Oct 14 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) giggled softly, though she knew a small part of that statment was sad. The death of family was just so painlessly common in their world these days. She sighed softly and thought back to the young girl briefly. She felt her smile grow once more upon her face. Her body language showed that she was enjoying this time with Orthos, and perhaps more? Chakra would be sent to her brain, on impulse, attempting to activate her dormant dojutsu. Weather or not it would work, she would not even be aware of it. Her body moved as if on auto pilot, enjoying the food provided.

"I see. . Well, I won't fight you if that's your choice. I remeber when I lost my parents. . My brother told me very bluntly what had happened. Then he just, , Vainshed one day. . I've not be able to find him, nor find out if he is alive or dead." 

She finished.* - Wed Oct 14 13:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blushed deeply as she looked over Ortho. She honestly had no way of responding to that. Then it hit her. Erebus had always made fun of her for being to rigid. She smiled suddenly as she closed her eyes. Her mind was now fully at peace as she whispered two words. Not to Ortho, but to the man she was clinging to who would never return. 

"Good bye"

The words were for him, and in a way for Suitengu. She could not persue the anger that consumed her anymore, she could not turn some future meeting in a sudden battle of life or death over the past. So in that moment she simply let it all go and then opened her eyes at Orthos. 

"Thanks. .  I'll admit, Your growing on me as well. .  but I don't know how fast and in what way yet. . but I know I want you near. .for the time being as my best friend. .then maybe down the line something more?"* - Wed Oct 14 14:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) beamed back at him before yawning suddenly then blushing. 

"Can we head back? I am getting really sleepy."* - Wed Oct 14 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) takes his hand thankfully, falling asleep on the ride back to Suna* - Wed Oct 14 14:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sleeps peacefully on the bech, near Ortho* - Wed Oct 14 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Should I stay or follow? - Wed Oct 14 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If I do follow . . . Ain't going to stay long anyway. - Wed Oct 14 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have to sleep soon. - Wed Oct 14 20:43:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: So! What are today's plans Ortho? Shall we continue training? - Wed Oct 14 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Good monring Hideki - Wed Oct 14 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: -- - Wed Oct 14 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Good morning, Marrisa. - Wed Oct 14 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: How did you rest? - Wed Oct 14 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Good. Good. You? - Wed Oct 14 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: BEtter then I have in a very long time - Wed Oct 14 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: That's good. - Wed Oct 14 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I was wondering. . Could you show me another Fire jutsu? or help me with Genjutsu? - Wed Oct 14 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I have one I could possibly teach you. - Wed Oct 14 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It's classified as a C rank. - Wed Oct 14 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Oh? - Wed Oct 14 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mhm. - Wed Oct 14 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: what is it called? - Wed Oct 14 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Fire Style: Misty Flames Dance Jutsu. - Wed Oct 14 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I'd be honored to learn sir. - Wed Oct 14 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Then come with me. - Wed Oct 14 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: coming. - Wed Oct 14 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Wed Oct 14 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked and nodded before she inhaled a deep breath. She would form the handsigns with a bit to overzealous movement of her hands. She messed up the last handsign, and ended up expelling the lungful of air she had amassed. It was clear this technique had a large amount of use to the fan user. A whole field of explodable gas to fight ones enemies? That could not be passed up on. She would smile softly at Hideki, a notable lack of the anger that normally boiled behind would be noticed. 

"I'll get it next time sorry"* - Wed Oct 14 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Take your time. Focus. - Wed Oct 14 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) nodded and relaxed her body as she slowly manuvered her arms into the netural starting postion, hands casped together. Her chakra slowly began to gather from the the core of her begin, mixxing with the fire element in her stomach and moving toward her lungs. The kunoichi would then inhale a deep breath, provideing the jutsu with a large source of air to mix with the growing chakra. She then formed the handsigns quickly but carefully and precicesly. In a flurry of motion, she would breath out the gas in a cloud before her. She would step back and then toss a lit match into the production, whice exploded as it was supposed to.* - Wed Oct 14 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) puts a 10 ryo bounty on Hideki* - Wed Oct 14 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hey Marrisa you feeling better i see. - Wed Oct 14 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) sat cross legged and form the handsigns she eas taught earlier, produceing a small amount of flamable gas and lightly it with a lit match. She was clearly training this new jutsu! As was her habit. She smiled at Trilliam innocently.

"Yea.. Sorry about not telling anyone. . but it was awsome right?"* - Wed Oct 14 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: indeed! I am ever greatful! Master Fuji will even try and improve my fan with the stinger we salvaged!  - Wed Oct 14 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Good thing I was there to retrieve said stinger I guess... - Wed Oct 14 22:05:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) orders Ramen for everyone then sits next to Ortho. She would smile up at her Master. The anger that was usually in her eyes was gone as she spoke. 

"Master. . I have let go of my desire to do harm to those who have harmed me."* - Thu Oct 15 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) she smiled then seemed to lean ever slightly agasint Ortho

"My friend Ortho helped me remember who I was. . Or rather. . Reminded me of the me I had always strived to be. He has helped me return to the path of one who would defend the weak, and strive to prevent bloodshed not cause it. I shall take my revenge by becoming stronger, and helping to create a world where violance dosen't need to be the answer to anything. I will become the shield that defends the weak. .

I care little for shinobi now..My resolve is around my clan and those dear.. - Thu Oct 15 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked at Ortho's comment. She had been called a great many things in her life, but never light before. She smiled softly.* - Thu Oct 15 04:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) listened to the story, inthralled by it. Her eyes went wide as she realised that the current Kazekage had outlived another. It was always a sad thing to have a loved one pass. She nodded to Fuji. 

"I am sorry for your loss Master. . "* - Thu Oct 15 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) blinked and thought back to it. Her youth was not so long ago, but it felt like ages, she had seen alot in her twenty years of life. She would nod and begin to speak.

"I lived in Suna my whole life. . I think I recall Katsya. . At least a little. . My youth is a little bit of a haze. I had a mother and a father, and a brother. My parents passed in a mission, and my brother was left to raise me. He told me of their deaths, made me toughen up. Then he vanished sometime later."

She spoke softly, Revisting the past once more for her master's benefit was an easy task, this pain was long since dealt with. She thought about it some more now. 

"I lived in feat most of my life. . Making clothing to make ends meet. .Never really doing much to better myself. "

(I lost Net for a while)

"Then one day, A man named Erebus found me in suna. . And whisked me off to Konoha. . From their I began my path to becoming the women you see before you. . Met my adoptive brother Suitengu. . And then had to deal with the pain of loseing both of them, one after another. . and now I am here"* - Thu Oct 15 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxinea) shook her head and spoke.

"No, I've only memories in Konoha now. . I'd like to keep it that way. The only thing that had kept me there was Hideki, as you told me to seek his training. When he refused to teach me, I returned home. I am happier for it. I am eager to see my future. . With Ortho. . And with you Master."* - Thu Oct 15 05:49:52 2015
