<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Alright.
<br><font color=yellow>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) turns and leaves the Hokage's building.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) grunts in anger as he summons his mech from its scroll. Seithin gets inside of the machine and turns to the Mizukage's mansion. He would surge is chakra in it, this would cause the mech to activate to its full power. The boy then causes it to hold up its gun and aim at the Mizukage's mansion. 

"I hope you all burn in hell." He says as he pulls the trigger. The gun would fire about 500 senbon at the building. They would rip through it and tear through the place, damaging and destroying just about everything inside. 

As Seithin's gun begins to overheat, he stops firing and deactivates the mech. He leaps out and reseals it to its scroll. "Rose...If you have any respect for yourself or your village...You'll leave with me, right now." He says as he begins to run from the village.*

<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (hmm...Its hard to say lol...But I'd say Edo Madara)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Its tough indeed, I would say Naruto is getting there quick)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (If he truly has mastered 9 tails now, hes supposed to surpass the SOT6P)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (If his body keeps evolving at this rate, he will look like a copy of the Sage himself)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Dont you think?)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (hmm...yeh that will happen)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Slap a rinnegan on him and youll think he is the Sage Reincarnated or something)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (xD)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Lol. Kyuubi gonna mutate into Juubi XD)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (He might be destined to combine the Tailed beasts)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Tbh)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (he already is)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Its something thats seem to be hinted)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (oh)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Kyuubi has some of 8 tails/7tails/6tails/5tails/4tails/3Tails/2tails chakra)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Its only missing shukaku
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (When did Hachibi give him power?)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He took it from hachibi)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (When hachibi was showing naruto what to do to get kyuubi's chakra
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (kyuubi ripped off one of the tentacles and absorbed the chakra in it
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Wow I cant believe I didnt pay enough attention)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Well if Naruto can convince Kyubi, he can convince any of the tailed beasts to help him)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (If it was up to Gaara, he wouldnt hesitate)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (ik
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (and theres this contraversy with the masked madara)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (some people argue whether he is really madara, but he has to be. Who else could he be)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (When he talked about his past, we seem him as a young Madara(
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He is someone from Madara's past)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Old enough to know who he is.)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He isn't Madara)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (If he was, Madara couldn't have been resurrected)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Why not? Perhaps he changed bodies like Orochimaru)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (or some kind of DNA clone)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Cause his soul would have to reside in the pure world...aka dead
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (unless hes a clone)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He is not the "Real" Madara)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Clone isn't the real one either.)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (However, Clone isn't too far-fetched)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (He called himself a shell of his former self)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (With Zetsu subsitute ability)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He used that to intimidate the kages)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Only Madara could have the EMS)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (its not easy to obtain you know)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (He also seemed to possess the rinnegan)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Mysterious man with kg of a dead clan that was presumed, yet never confirmed dead)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (that he claimed to have given to Nagato)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Like I said. He is someone with CLOSE connections to madara)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Imo)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He is just a super Zetsu)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He showed Zetsu traits)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Even if he was Madara's best friend or relative, he couldnt get an EMS without having a brother with a mangekyou sharingan)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Unless he stole Madara's EMS)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Tobi doesn't have ems)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (He doesnt?)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He only has sharingan)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He stole rinnegan from Nagato's dead body)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (He claimed he gave it to him)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Did he lie?)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Its a possibility. )
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (How could he phase through objects without EMS?)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Normal sharingan doesnt have such power)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (and teleport)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He isn't a normal person)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He experiments alot with sharingan)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (He could have made a super sharingan with such an ability)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Which is why, i dnt really like to argue bout tobi)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Really?)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Too many possibilities)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (He is complicated)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (And that)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (So...I say people should just wait until his shiz is revealed)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (So we can all be happy naruto readers)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Yeah its so hard to predict this stuff)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Although I wonder if Sasuke will obtain Rinnegan and Naruto the physical body, and then when they confront the big bad, they merge their powers
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Awakening the full power of the Sage)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Yin/Yang)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Something like that)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (-shrugs- It could happen)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (Maybe they will show Naruto as Hokage in the epilogue)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Lol. I'd hope so. Unless something happens that is a legit reason for him not to be hokage)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (imma bbl...gotta do some HW)
<br><font color=green>*Taishi(SSJ3GOHAN007) says: (good luck)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (lol thnx)
<br><font color=green>*Kazuma(Chidori64) says: (Cya)
