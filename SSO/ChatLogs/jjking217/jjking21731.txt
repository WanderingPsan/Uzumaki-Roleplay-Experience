<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) walks forward, aiming to lift her up in his arms as he'd aim to continue walking while carrying her. He'd glance to Nigen followed by the orange haired male before he continued walking.* - Sun Nov 15 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Right. What is it? - Sun Nov 15 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ended up bringing her to her house, as he entered, his garb and the works were quickly sealed away. She'd probably noticed how clean the male looked, his clothes well pressed, the only difference was that he was a bit older,taller, and his hair was white but his roots were still black. "I hope they've been treating you like a Queen in my abscence."* - Sun Nov 15 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) it was in fact the man known as Index, and he aimed to set her down gently.* - Sun Nov 15 23:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) kneeled before her as he bowed his head at her feet, as he spoke "I went to long without seeing my Beautiful Queen, And my schedule has been freed up greatly...I have a lot to report to you---I assure you I've been doing as much work as possible for you in my abscence to assure that my return wouldn't be without surprises."* - Sun Nov 15 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) shook his head as he spoke "That's not neccessarily true,  But Sunagakure was so easy to re-infiltrate, not only that. I'm apart of the Kazekage's Personal Guard and Black Ops." He smiled warmly as she patted his head, Before he spoke "Before we continue, let's get you more comfortable, Would you like tea or wine?" He asked with a warm smile.* - Sun Nov 15 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) moved to pick her up, before walking over to the couch he'd set her down once again. Before heading into the kitchen, he'd take a bottle of sake, followed by two glasses. Approaching the couch, he'd set all items down, before proceeding to pour a glass for Asterotd one for himself. Looking to her he motioned for her to place her feet atop of his lap. Seems like he had transitioned back into servant mode, as he offered her the glass. 

"It was fairly easy, I've grown a lot.  Matured. But as you may've known, Muhhamed has been expanding Sunagakure's reach."* - Sun Nov 15 23:38:40 2015
