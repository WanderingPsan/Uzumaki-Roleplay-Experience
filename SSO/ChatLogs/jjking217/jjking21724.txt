<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) says: Mhm. - Thu Nov  5 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) had decided to take this time to relax and train, he figured he'd have a lot of time for that since Katsune was on vacation, he'd have to better his skills for both their sakes. He had to get stronger and advance, he needed to be able to protect Katsune no matter what happened so as he relaxed on the ground, he inhaled followed by a soft exhale. As he reached into his back pocket and pulled out a small scroll.

As he sat there he sighed knowing he had a considerable amount of work to do, so he began reading the scroll, and he was great at multi-tasking so as he read the scroll he began to mentally go over his technique his intention was very much that to become adept in the uses of all of his techniques,  as well as learn another one or so.

He smiled warmly as he relaxed on the ground, and smiled. He was making a lot of process and  he was liking it. He was hoping to be further along but where he currently was was fine as well. He had a bit more to go but he didn't seem to fret the small stuff, and simply continued working on, not desiring to fall behind, at the very least he'd  be prepared for whatever came his way. He didn't want to become like Kilm.

He felt like he had a firm grasp on what that technique was so he transitioned to another one which he had in his scroll which was the technique known as Vaccume Sphere, it was a fairly high ranking technique but he felt like he had the ability and potential to do this. So he had to continue to try so he gave it his all. He didn't want to fail.

So he focused on the technique at hand, he had a lot of ability when it came to the wind element and this technique seemed to be on the more powerful side. So he smiled, that excited him almost as learning the technique himself, though he missed Katsune a lot, but he'd keep progressing and keep working towards his ideal goal,he had to afterall.

He loved his own potential, but what he loved even more was the potential of others, he enjoyed human interaction greatly. But he prefered interaction with the Human female, it was a lot more interesting...Exciting, he wanted to continue to strive off of that excitement, from this point on that was his life...His enjoyment came from excitement doing something he knew would kill him it made him happy.

He'd live life and enjoy everything it had to offer, he wanted to be free of his bindings, to live and to die as he chose. With or without the person he chose to live beside. He wasn't sure who he could trust, well the only person he was sure he could trust was himself, and  Katsune. He thought he had friends....A brother....But that wasn't so. He'd quickly betray him if given the chance.* - Thu Nov  5 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) slowly sighed, as he relaxed at the base of a tree, resting his back against the tree, he inhaled followed by a gentle exhale. His legs were crossed, and slowly he decided it was time for his meditation once again, it helped him clear his mind and think about the next move he needed to make, he needed to make a decision for himself not anyone else. What type of world did he want to live in? He hadn't quite decided.

He understood this world, was horrible. It was broken, and so were it's people. Everyone around him was destined to betray at some point or another. But if he could acknowledge their flaws, he could accept this world, and work towards making it better.  He knew his own limitation, was only his mind, if he expected nothing of the world, he couldn't expect anything from himself. He was a product of his world.

He knew his world was crying, that it was broken...But in this sadness, he found it...Beautiful...extroadinarily so it's impurity made it sparkle like a diamond in the rough. He considered a Human's imperfection to be their perfection, everyone was flawed. He was as well, but he loved this world. Enough that he desired to protect it, and see it shining. He valued everything on this planet. He was on Iselia...He was an Iseliaian, and this was his world. 

He needed the strength to protect them.* - Thu Nov  5 13:27:40 2015

"Tell Muhhamed, he should contact me some time. If he really wants answers."

He asked, he seemed to be in an actually good mood, as he suddenly skipped forward, spinning on a single foot as he spoke:

"There is three days...Until the World Tournament. That's your Deadline, Marissa, and Sunagakure. After the tournament has concluded, You -will- end your hunt. I'd gladly speak with Muhhamed face to face, he seems to be the only one in Sunagakure, who doesn't have their face in some girl's snatch, or their mouths wrapped around some guy's cock."

"Because...If this foolish behavior...Doesn't end during that time...I will be mad Marissa. If a man chose to die, Who are -any- of you, to try and avenge his -suicide-?"* - Thu Nov  5 20:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) raised a hand to his lips, and actually -stopped- breathing for a second, as laughter consumed him. Falling from his perch, he laughed...And laughed....And laughed. As he spoke "Fine Woman."

"He didn't try to flee, he was trying to create distance. Kilm utilized long range Ninjutsu dominantly."

He paused:

"Do you know what he said "If possible, Find a way to revive my sorry ass." If we intended to kill the 'Sage', we would've done so. It wouldn't have been left alive, in such shit condition."

"And in my opinion, You're a girl who needs to get laid. Honestly, I feel like, Zetsumo had some defective sperm, that manifested itself into you, with have a brain."

"And closing out my argument---What fuckup in their right mind, Would waltz into a village armed to the teeth to kill them on sight?--I'm sorry, You may not have considered the dangers of that suggestion. But when your Shinobi attacked me---You're lucky, I didn't slaughter each and every one of them. And I quote, I would've, taken my time, and stabbed them repeatedly, in the throat, until their vocal coords, were as mushy as animal feed. And the only sound they could make, made them sound like they were constipated on a toilet---That's if they survived." 

He then decided to look to Ortho "Before you ask, I am sick to the head---Maybe I'm just a bit bored. I've desired to be confrontational for a while now. Although, I already told you the price for taking your life. It's One Hundred Million And -one- yen."* - Thu Nov  5 20:37:45 2015

Try to be heroic...I saw the blood lust in your eyes...You think you're so different than everyone else...You probably believe you can change the world through good intentions."

He paused, as he spoke "The road to hell, is paved in good intentions." 

He began walking forward, looking at Ortho as he simply stated:

"I'd like to consider you a brother, But if you step in front of me....When I'm prepared to kill someone. I'll consider you an obstacle, Ortho. And I know you'd do the same. We are all, Criminals. We become Shinobi saying we wish to protect what we believe in." He paused.

"But at the end of the day, We all were looking for an excuse to Kill without consequences."* - Thu Nov  5 20:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Okay. - Thu Nov  5 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Go ahead and roll. - Thu Nov  5 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Index was around when I was naked... maybe Ortho doesn't care about him. - Thu Nov  5 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Alright. - Thu Nov  5 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: The roll was pinch my stomach. - Thu Nov  5 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If you don't want to do that, you can take a penalty. - Thu Nov  5 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked, and bit his bottom lip a bit at the pinch. It was definately an odd placed to be pinched as he spoke "I was thinking I'd have you roll again for a Penalty with 1-3 Being Truth and 4-6 Being Dare, Any suggestions though?" He asked, reaching for the dice.* - Thu Nov  5 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Thu Nov  5 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Right, you said that. - Thu Nov  5 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay... what now? - Thu Nov  5 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looks at her as he spoke "This is my roll~." He spoke, before rolling the dice forward, waiting to see what unluckiness would befall them.* - Thu Nov  5 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm... - Thu Nov  5 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Rub your stomach? - Thu Nov  5 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) leaned forward, as he extended his palm, and it'd find the fabric over her stomach, and with a few motions. He'd begin rubbing her stomach, for about five or so seconds, before he leaned back and relaxed. "How would you feel about after five rounds---If we play that long, to make the game a bit more difficult?"* - Thu Nov  5 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: This is strange. - Thu Nov  5 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Um....okay. - Thu Nov  5 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I was honestly hoping for more chances to ask her questions, I feel like she'd be more likely to answer under the rules of a game.. - Thu Nov  5 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) offered her the dice.* - Thu Nov  5 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Kiss my head..? - Thu Nov  5 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) stayed still, appreciating her desire not to kiss him on the lips. But still a faint pinkening of his cheeks may've been detected. But after a moment, he nodded before reaching for the dice.* - Thu Nov  5 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked and by a show of surprise, he was stunned by how soft her lips were against his forehead. But when he rolled the dice, he scratched his cheek. "Lick your foot.." He stated waiting for her to decide if she actually cared or not, and raised her foot unless she expected him to bend down.* - Thu Nov  5 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) reached for her leg, and slowly he'd lift it, he realised that this happened to be one of the parts of the game he disliked, he wasn't going to lick her shoe. He'd much rather lick her foot, but he hadn't been able to make a dare that would require her to take it off or anything---"I'll take a penalty." He stated, rolling his dice forward.* - Fri Nov  6 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Uh... - Fri Nov  6 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You get to dare me to do something. - Fri Nov  6 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You are scared of licking a foot? - Fri Nov  6 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's not so much scared. - Fri Nov  6 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'd do it if you didn't have shoes on. - Fri Nov  6 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Fri Nov  6 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Fri Nov  6 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Just dirt collects on the outside of shoes y'know? - Fri Nov  6 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn...yes. - Fri Nov  6 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know what a dare is. - Fri Nov  6 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's when you basically 'give a command', something the other person has to do., - Fri Nov  6 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Like if you wanted me to lick your shoe, or something. - Fri Nov  6 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then... - Fri Nov  6 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I suppose....I can answer any question you want then. - Fri Nov  6 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That'd be truth. - Fri Nov  6 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Man....She really isn't like other girls is she? - Fri Nov  6 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Why do you want me with Ortho? - Fri Nov  6 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I don't. - Fri Nov  6 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I thought it'd be funny in all honesty. - Fri Nov  6 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Fri Nov  6 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: To see you flustered, as well as him. - Fri Nov  6 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you think you got me flustered? - Fri Nov  6 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I wasn't expecting him to develop any feelings. - Fri Nov  6 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I honestly, doubt it. - Fri Nov  6 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You didn't. - Fri Nov  6 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then this is the perfect time to try. - Fri Nov  6 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: This is round five. - Fri Nov  6 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: How do you make it more difficult? - Fri Nov  6 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Pick Five Body parts this time. - Fri Nov  6 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Parts that. - Fri Nov  6 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Make you feel 'uncomfortable'. - Fri Nov  6 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Or that are untouched. - Fri Nov  6 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: *nod* - Fri Nov  6 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Nevermind... - Fri Nov  6 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll pick five then? - Fri Nov  6 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: O-okay. - Fri Nov  6 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I feel like I'm bad at this game. - Fri Nov  6 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Foot, Leg, Chest....Neck, Butt. And if you roll a Six, You have to remove a piece of clothing. - Fri Nov  6 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Are you fine with that? - Fri Nov  6 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah, the actions are the same. - Fri Nov  6 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So because your first roll was a six. Which corrolated to body parts.. - Fri Nov  6 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Remove a piece of clothing. - Fri Nov  6 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) reaches for the dice.* - Fri Nov  6 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as she removed the belt, but besides that his gaze was averted to the side. Had he been given the dice he'd roll.* - Fri Nov  6 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Chest... - Fri Nov  6 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Rub. - Fri Nov  6 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: How do you know if you are good at this game? - Fri Nov  6 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you...Mind? - Fri Nov  6 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) reached forward, his blush was definately there. He had no clue why she wasn't embarrassed...And it baffled him, his left hand would make contact with her breast, through the fabric. And with a few circular motions, he rubbed her chest, with a single 'grope', for size. He'd retract his hand, with his gaze averted he'd offer her the dice.* - Fri Nov  6 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) scratched his cheek, as his gaze was shifted to the side, he coughed nervously a few times as he spoke "I-It's because it's an odd gesture...M-Maybe...We should stop.." He stated, with a defeated sigh. This was really pushing it, as he turned to face the ground.* - Fri Nov  6 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: N-No.. - Fri Nov  6 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You're doing fine. - Fri Nov  6 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I just don't want to do something wrong. - Fri Nov  6 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And I feel like if we continue, I'd be betraying someone I trust. - Fri Nov  6 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I haven't done anything bad, neither have you... have you? - Fri Nov  6 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: We haven't...But the best way to avoid something bad, is to prevent it. - Fri Nov  6 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And you like Ortho right..? - Fri Nov  6 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You said if we don't want to do something we take a penalty. - Fri Nov  6 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then... - Fri Nov  6 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll take a penalty. - Fri Nov  6 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...but...you already did it? - Fri Nov  6 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It's my turn to roll? - Fri Nov  6 00:31:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Y-Yeah.. - Fri Nov  6 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Something is wrong. - Fri Nov  6 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What's wrong? - Fri Nov  6 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: She tottally roped me into this game. - Fri Nov  6 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Nothing...Let's continue. - Fri Nov  6 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ---. - Fri Nov  6 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Uh... - Fri Nov  6 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I think I'll take another penalty. - Fri Nov  6 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...but..but this is mine? - Fri Nov  6 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You can't take a penalty for me can you? - Fri Nov  6 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ...U-Uh...I suppose you're...Right.. - Fri Nov  6 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What is it? - Fri Nov  6 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Uh...R-Rub butt. - Fri Nov  6 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Why don't you want me to do that? - Fri Nov  6 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's just....Aw-Awkward. - Fri Nov  6 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Why? - Fri Nov  6 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I mean.... - Fri Nov  6 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I suppose...Becuase that's what people have taught...I guess it isn't that weird. - Fri Nov  6 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I mean...I wouldn't have a problem doing it to her...It's sexist if that doesn't extend both ways... - Fri Nov  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Could you do me a favor then..? - Fri Nov  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Hm? - Fri Nov  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Don't tell anyone about this game? - Fri Nov  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Not even Ortho? - Fri Nov  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Why? - Fri Nov  6 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I feel like...He'd hold this over his head. - Fri Nov  6 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And he wouldn't enjoy me playing this with you. - Fri Nov  6 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Over my head* - Fri Nov  6 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Why? - Fri Nov  6 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked away, and it was something about her words "Pre-Fertilization." Which caused his gaze to be averted, and his blush became more pronounced as he spoke "Y-Yeah...You c-could say that...But in places like Kirigakure...This is just a normal game p-played amongst friends.."* - Fri Nov  6 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) leaned back against the wall which didn't do much to make a gap as he spoke "Y-Yeah...It's a pretty...Strange place..."He stated, swallowing hard, her gaze made him nervous--Or rather embarrassed him. This wasn't how he envsioned this going.* - Fri Nov  6 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Aren't you suppose to do these things with Katsune? - Fri Nov  6 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sighed as he relaxed, his gaze found his lap. And his excitement seemed to vanish as he spoke:

"Yeah...But she's gone for a while...It's been almost two weeks...I got a little ahead of myself.. That tends to happen to us guys.." He stated, with a sigh, he was happy this stopped before anything else happened. But he bowed his head to Ume:

"I'm sorry for having you play this with me."* - Fri Nov  6 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I thought it'd be fun...Maybe I'd get to know you... - Fri Nov  6 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But I guess subconciously something else.. - Fri Nov  6 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Something else? - Fri Nov  6 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm truly sorry, Ume. - Fri Nov  6 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And... if you wanted to know me...  you could have just asked. - Fri Nov  6 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ....why are you sorry? - Fri Nov  6 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Because, I did something I shouldn't have...You're probably mad at me. - Fri Nov  6 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And...Would you really have let me learn about you if I asked..? - Fri Nov  6 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...what did you do that you shouldn't have? - Fri Nov  6 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And... of course? - Fri Nov  6 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...maybe...not tell you everything...but you could learn things a friend learns. - Fri Nov  6 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Like what..? - Fri Nov  6 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm.... younger than I look? - Fri Nov  6 00:54:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: As long as you don't me. - Fri Nov  6 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Why did you ask that... it's.... 'rude'. - Fri Nov  6 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ...I-I'm sorry! - Fri Nov  6 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I didn't mean to be rude! - Fri Nov  6 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Maybe that covered my reaction.... - Fri Nov  6 00:58:01 2015
