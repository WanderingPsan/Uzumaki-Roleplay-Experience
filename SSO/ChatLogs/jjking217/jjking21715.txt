<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was enjoying just sitting here with Katsune, and as such he felt more...Comfortable, not to say he wasn't terribly nervous. But he relaxed some, and his hand rested against her stomach as he spoke "I see." But he paused for a second before he asked "Do you intend on taking the knowledge exam or the Physical?" He asked curiously, he figured with enough studying she wouldn't need to risk her life in a fight.* - Tue Oct 27 00:52:03 2015

But he didn't mind, "Sweet Dreams, Kat." Was what he said as he rose to his feet and headed into the kitchen.* - Tue Oct 27 01:20:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: EIther you speak to me here or not at all. - Tue Oct 27 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) approached Xon, as he simply attempted to placed a single hand on the back of his Large Shuriken as he leaned in for a whisper.* - Tue Oct 27 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was going to enjoy this, so the moment Xon backed up, Index stepped forward once again as he spoke "I'm bored, Let's play a game."* - Tue Oct 27 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yo! What's up? - Tue Oct 27 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) skipped forward once again, he didn't seem to have any issues keeping upw ith Xon, But for all intents and purposes he had no weapons.* - Tue Oct 27 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) seriously wondered how he was violating someone's personal space whilst they remained in the air out of his physical reach. He looked towards Xon and shook his head "You keep calling me a servant of some randomn woman, And you won't even uphold your own manners. If you are a man you'll talk to me face to face."* - Tue Oct 27 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) shook his head as he stated "You shouldn't fly outside, You'll hit a bird." He stated lightly, keeping pace with Xon which wasn't an honest concern of his.* - Tue Oct 27 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Hassan? - Tue Oct 27 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) simply follows behind the floating cloud.* - Tue Oct 27 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) simply sighed as he realised how stupid Xon really was, and the moment he saw the smoke comming towards him, his hands moved together. Clapping, as a trully massive gale wind shot towards Xon. Most likely easily repelling the smoke which had come his way, he really needed Xon to attack first, It made his life...So much easier. 

 He didn't hold back one bit, and the intention was to obviously de-thrown the man from his cloud, since Xon had made it so much easier for him, by having walked away he had no concern about holding back. * - Tue Oct 27 02:48:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at Xon as he simply stated "You know, I've realised this world is...A crappy place." He paused as his hands were raised to chest level going through a series of handseals. As he inhaled and exhaled rapidly for a total of six turns, compressed air bullets shooting from his lips, aimed at striking both the male's kneecaps, his arms,  his chest, and finally his skull. Each carried the capacity to break bones as he simply stated:

"But I've come to accept this, this one...In escapable fact, That this is the world we live in, and be extension this is the product of what we've created."

He looked towards Xon as he simply stated "I hope that, in your final moments you can come to accept that." As two fingers were raised up he simply uttered the words:

"May we meet once again in Hell, but until then. May whatever god you worship protect you from it's flames."* - Tue Oct 27 03:11:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) approaches Asteroth with his head bowed as he spoke "I'm sorry, My Queen...I've failed your mission...I over-estimated my opponent."* - Tue Oct 27 03:18:49 2015

"I'm....Sorry My Queen, I'll take any punishment you have to offer to attone for my failure..." He stated.* - Tue Oct 27 03:25:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head as he lifted the body and carried it off to the morgue, as he simply stated "I'll be awaiting my punishment." He stated with a defeated sigh, he did look as if he beat himself up a lot.* - Tue Oct 27 03:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Honestly, I was surprised he was being so stupid. - Tue Oct 27 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: You'd think an Ambassador would have more sense. - Tue Oct 27 19:36:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) offers his hand to her, though he felt as if he knew what her reply would be and as such if she didn't he'd begin walking off.* - Tue Oct 27 20:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) turned on his heel and began walking.* - Tue Oct 27 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at Katsune as she laid upon the couch and casually he first headed into the kitchen making two glasses of tea, which was probably a generic brand. He sweetened them lightly, before returning to the couch, he rested both cups on the table, as  he looked to see if there was space to scoot in behind her, if there wasn't he'd scratch his cheek before asking. 

"Mind, If I?" He stated, looking at her back as she rubbed her face against the pillow. He felt oddly calm, though he planned to ask the generic "You okay?" But he felt like times have gotten stressful for her.* - Tue Oct 27 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) reached for the glass of tea, offering it to her slowly as to not spill a drop, but after having done so, he'd step over her body, to position himself behind her before scooting back with his back against the couch. Giving her space for the most part as he spoke:

"Want to talk about it?" He asked lightly, as he looked  at her.* - Tue Oct 27 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: About what? - Tue Oct 27 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) scooted closer, aiming to put his arm around her, as he spoke "I feel like between me and Kilm, we're stressing you out." He admitted lightly, wondering if maybe he was misreading the situation, but he felt as if, had he been placed in her shoes he'd without a doubt be stressed.* - Tue Oct 27 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Definitely. - Tue Oct 27 20:37:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's way healthier to pretend none of that is happening. - Tue Oct 27 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then...Pretend we shall. - Tue Oct 27 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Should've sent a shadow clone to town today. - Tue Oct 27 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Went in person instead. - Tue Oct 27 20:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You should probably stop calling yourself a spy. - Tue Oct 27 21:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as she began turning in place a bit curious as to what she was doing but he'd get his answer soon enough as her arms wrapped around him, followed by her legs and finally her butt resting upon his lap. He first gasped in surprise, going with her motions before  he was pushed onto his back with her laying on top. His notorious blush, resurfaced. He was speechless for a few moments, he gazed down at her head which rested on his chest.

And slowly his arms moved to wrap around her back as he spoke:

"This is more than enough, Kat." 

She'd without a doubt be able to feel if not hear the accelerated pace of his heartbeat, which moved to a warm yet, fierce symphony. But in this moment, there was no one he'd rather be with than Kat herself.* - Tue Oct 27 21:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked up to her as she looked into his eyes he looked back into hers, not minding the gauntlets that rested on his bellt as he simply stated "If you're asking...If I'm sure he's Dead...That I am. I'm not honestly, afraid of a lynch mob...That situation can be handled, with the death of 'Index'. Though If at all possible I had intended to save this method in case something....Worse happened."* - Tue Oct 27 22:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked "Oh, I feel stupid." He paused for a bit reconsidering his thoughts on the situation as he simply asked "Shin..I feel like, if push comes to shove, I'll be able to deal with it...Probably, but as for a definitive plan, I'm not sure. But they don't actually know who killed Hideki though. Using the same solution, I can either let them get what they're after, or Fight them off. But the latter isn't the smartest idea...What would you do?" He asked her a bit perplexed by what to do.* - Tue Oct 27 22:10:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then, I'd use the interrogation jutsu to see what the truth is. - Tue Oct 27 22:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: A Mountain, in the land of water. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You lied to me about that. There's no way you fought him off openly. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But I'd prefer to face my accusers directly. - Tue Oct 27 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If we found out exactly what was going on, I might kill every single one of your enemies myself. - Tue Oct 27 22:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I appreciate it Kat, But I don't see us finding out their names not anytime soon. - Tue Oct 27 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And on a side note--. - Tue Oct 27 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: At the risk of making this situation....Incredibly awkward, with you...Sitting on my lap and all...I'd like to avoid...A problem... - Tue Oct 27 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) released a low gasp, before he bit his bototm lip as she began swaying to and fro.He felt his heart racing, as he looked at her, but his gaze was averted off to the side as his blush became more pronounced. Even with his eyes off to the side, he could feel Katsune's gaze upon him as he spoke "A-A really b-bad one." He muttered, he felt his blood rushing down below, which would without a doubt result in Katsune's butt getting poked by something that seemed to be getting bigger the more she swayed.* - Tue Oct 27 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as she paused he felt like maybe she'd spare him an awkward conversation after this, but he felt her hands find his chest as she leaned, forward. He stole a glance towards her, his heart was racing. And he felt the bulge that grew beneath her reaching it's point of full growth. But when she started to grind, he once again released a gasp, though it was definately louder than the first. The feeling of friction as she moved against him, was almost overpowering.

"I-I'm n-not sure I-I'll be a-able to focus on t-the conversation." He admitted lightly, through closed eyes, her slow motions, were driving him crazy, so painstackingly slow, but it also added a sense of 'excitement'. Or so he felt.* - Tue Oct 27 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was feeling the sensations of her motions sending warm 'chills' , throughout his body, as his gasping transitioned into a ligt moan. He found himself unconciously, holding grasping onto the cushion of the couch. His lips were held slightly agape, and the subtle twitching of them which accompanied the sounds he made. He was almost in his own world, though his focus was on the sensation of how closely her butt was pressed against him, combined with her motions which was driving him crazy.

Though with her assessment,he could be anywhere from Seven to Ten inches, on estimation. * - Tue Oct 27 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) wasn't expecting the pillow, but he didn't resist when it was placed over his face. Not that he honestly minded, in hindsight,  it was probably for the best. His heart was racing a bit faster, but his gasps, and other sounds were suppressed by that of the pillow. Though he made out Kat's words, he would've commented and said something insanely stupid, so it was probably better that she had covered his face.

Though something about being rubbed of his sight, only made the feeling so much more intense. He found himself slowly being pushed forward due to the arousal, he was every second of it. She may or may not notice, a subtle pulse like sensation from his crotch he was probably nearing his limit.* - Tue Oct 27 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt a light pressure atop the pillow as Katsune searched for his lips, only to have found them, he felt the pillow pushed a bit further in, completing her task of muffling him. He resisted the urge to move, Jashin knows he did. He felt her arms wrapping around his body, and her head atop of his chest. He wasn't sure if he should, but slowly his arms moved to wrap around her back, as she laid atop of him.

Though besides that he remained fairly still, just hugging her for a moment, though he was still almost painfully hard beneath her. His heart continued to race. But for now he was embracing this moment.* - Tue Oct 27 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can move the pillow....if you want. - Tue Oct 27 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) one of his hands move to grasp the pillow which covered his face, upon removing it, she'd probably notice that his cheeks were very much still red. But his breathing seemed to be calming. Along with other parts of his body, he looked to her. He didn't know what to say, he was just...Surprised to say the least. H didn't know what to say, or what to do, so in this moment he calmed down with Katsune atop of him.* - Tue Oct 27 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) slowly his hand trails up and down Katsune's back, gently rubbing it with gentle caresses. As he simply spoke "Hey, Kat." Aiming to grasp her attention if at all was possible.* - Tue Oct 27 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm....? - Tue Oct 27 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I... - Tue Oct 27 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: D...Do you think, we can stay like....This for a bit longer...? - Tue Oct 27 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I....Didn't know what to say...And didn't want it to end up...In awkward silence... - Tue Oct 27 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I probably....Shouldn't have said anything to begin with... - Tue Oct 27 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Why am I so stupid? - Tue Oct 27 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: T-That was weird...wasn't it? - Wed Oct 28 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm....? - Wed Oct 28 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Me raping you? - Wed Oct 28 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: omit - Wed Oct 28 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: M-Me asking i-if we can stay l-like this for a while longer... - Wed Oct 28 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would slowly aim to place a single hand around Katsune's back, as he slowly began to sit up. Maybe with her on his lap still, as he simply asked "Kat, could you look at me for a minute?" He stated. Staring down at her person, his coal black eyes focused on her. * - Wed Oct 28 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a moment as she looked at him, and he looked at her and took a moment and simply stared in awe at how beautiful she was. He leaned forward, attempting to gently rest his forehead against hers, as he looked into her eyes. "An old friend once told me, To find something, worth fighting for, something worth surviving for." He paused as he looked at her once again as he simply uttered:

"You're something, I'm going to fight for, That I'm going to survive for. I'm done...With all this stupid stuff...Infiltrating multiple villages, gathering information. I'm casting that all aside, for you..." He stated lightly, watching her reaction.* - Wed Oct 28 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as she pulled back, followed by her speaking. He didn't expect more than that, he was just happy she responded at all. He looked at her for a bit longer, before. He inhaled followed by a gentle exhale, He understood he wasn't good at leading conversations, but he at least wanted to try as he stated  "All I ask is...That no matter how trivial you think something is, if you want to talk about it. I'll be here here to listen, and give my two cents.---But....I think I'm going to need a drink...." He stated almost subconciously.* - Wed Oct 28 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. . . - Wed Oct 28 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm....? - Wed Oct 28 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not gonna go get sake? - Wed Oct 28 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah, One second. - Wed Oct 28 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as she moved off of his lap, he looked at her for a moment, before he moved over to the Kitchen, and grabbed two bottles of sake. He wondered if they even needed glasses. But slowly he opted against it, heading back to the couch, he placed a bottle on the table before uncorking one of them, he raised it to his lips, and took a large gulp. Before setting it down on the floor figuring they could share it. As he moved to regain his spot. "Want some?" He asked, before he would've put the bottle down.* - Wed Oct 28 00:54:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) stood up from the couch, as he looked to her scratching his cheek witha  faint blush as he reached to pick up the sake he asked "W-Would you prefer...My room or yours..?"* - Wed Oct 28 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mine. . . - Wed Oct 28 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I liked Seisuke so. . . - Wed Oct 28 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Being in his room would make me uncomfortable. - Wed Oct 28 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Say....No more. - Wed Oct 28 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) swallowed hard, as he slowly looked towards her door, and assuming it was closed, he'd extend a hand to grasp the handle before turning it as he'd open the door for her to pass, before he himself would take a look around, he'd only been in here once, and he was drunk off his rocks, so he didn't remember any of it.

"Want me to...leave it open or close?" He asked lightly.* - Wed Oct 28 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he slowly pushed the door shut, before slowly raising his bottle to his lips, taking another sip of the liquid. Before he looked at Kat as she found a place on the bed "May I..?" He felt she probably expected him to sit down, but out of habit he figured he should ask before sitting upon her bed, and if she said yes, He'd find a comfortable position on the opposing side of her bed.* - Wed Oct 28 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. . . - Wed Oct 28 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after a moment, he transitioned into a laying position while remaining upright. His bottle was bought to his lips once again, as he shifted his gaze towards Katsune as he spoke "N-Nice room.." He seemed to be trying to make small talk. At least to somewhat help deal with his nerves.* - Wed Oct 28 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) ||With the assumption that he ended up drunk, and ended up passing out in her room, or maybe making it to his own. Once he woke up he'd head to the living room, wondering what to do with his life.* - Wed Oct 28 11:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) notices as Kat left her room, and was a bit surprised by her only wearing a T-Shirt,  he felt it was a good sign that she might've been getting more comfortable. Slowly he headed to the kitchen as he, looked back at her and spoke "Mornin' Kat, You have a taste for anything?" He asked curiously, looking through the fridge for what they actually have.* - Wed Oct 28 11:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Brownies. And milk. - Wed Oct 28 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But I doubt we have either of those. - Wed Oct 28 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I can run to the store if you'd like. - Wed Oct 28 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) turned just in time to catch the sight of Katsune smacking her clone's rear, he coughed a bit out of surprise. Before he slowly headed over to her side "Alright." He stated, with a subtle smile as he spoke "I'll probably go ahead and restock us soon, I'll be sure to get a bit more variety when it comes to food and drinks." He promised, nodding his head. There was probably a life-time supply of sake here anyway.* - Wed Oct 28 11:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as the clone returned to them, carrying the basket with two cartens of milk. He was thinking about what he should make for himself, but only then did he notice Katsune offering him one of the cartens. "Thanks." He stated, taking the drink, he slowly opened it before raising it to his lips, as he took a sip, feeling the liquid go down his throat. He closed his eyes briefly.

Before he looked at the basket, and slowly he reached forward to grab one, he felt the hear, and the softness as his fingers almost sunk right in, he raised it to his lips before he slowly bit down, impressed by the fluffiness, along with the taste of the brownie as he spoke:

"Wow these are good, Maybe I should let you be in charge of breakfast more often." He spoke with a warm smile.* - Wed Oct 28 11:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) just about finished his first brownie, before taking another sip of milk. He couldn't help offering a light laugh, as she stuffed her face after speaking. As he spoke:

"I wish the Village paid our expenses though, then we could focus on other things, don't you think?" He asked making small talk. Reaching for another brownie it was bought to his lips.* - Wed Oct 28 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I suppose that's true. - Wed Oct 28 12:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And Muhhamed is focusing on expanding and 'peace'. - Wed Oct 28 12:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Wed Oct 28 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't have the energy to wonder what he's up to. - Wed Oct 28 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It probably is the best if we don't try. - Wed Oct 28 12:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not like I'd care. - Wed Oct 28 12:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He could be sacrificing virgins. Don't care. - Wed Oct 28 12:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: All I care about is Konoha. - Wed Oct 28 12:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I never understood that though. - Wed Oct 28 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm....? - Wed Oct 28 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: The whole 'sacrificing virgins', Did it deal with 'purity' or something? - Wed Oct 28 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Oct 28 12:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as she forced the brownie into his mouth,  he assumed she wanted him to stop talking, and stop talking he did having gotten a face full of brownie. After a few moments he began slowly swallowing the brownie, before washing it down with milk. He was forced to cough a few times as he his throat was clear of brownie.

"M-Mean." He joked, rubbing some excess crumbs off of his lips. Though there were probably a few on his cheeks he missed.* - Wed Oct 28 12:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after a moment of eating some more brownies, roughly about one and a half, he washed it down before he asked "Any plans for today?"  He was curious, because lately it seemed as if he had a clear schedule.* - Wed Oct 28 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Oct 28 12:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That being the case you have no need to worry too much about rank. - Wed Oct 28 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yo. - Wed Oct 28 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took notice of the situation and immediately he stood once the door was opened, standing in front of Katsune to shield her from the gaze of whoever entered. Which happened to be Kilm, though after a moment, he realised he didn't need to. Honestly he was a bit irritated as he spoke:

"Who is he? And why did you think it a good idea to bring him here without asking?" He asked, the annoyance very much visible in his voice.* - Wed Oct 28 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: My brother. - Wed Oct 28 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have one more brother but I do not know where he is. - Wed Oct 28 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Doesn't mean you can just bring your entire family to crash here. - Wed Oct 28 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's fine. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's my fault. - Wed Oct 28 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My clone didn't lock the door behind her. - Wed Oct 28 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: No it's not fine Kat, At the very least he should've knocked, or even sent some kind of message giving us a head's up. - Wed Oct 28 13:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I gave her a message earlier that i'd be coming once my brother finishes learning. - Wed Oct 28 13:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I...did invite him. Forgot about that. - Wed Oct 28 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was hours ago. - Wed Oct 28 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So you wanted me to stay in the village until after the attack happens? - Wed Oct 28 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Thought I'd be asleep by the time he showed up. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Wasn't 'actually' gonna talk to him. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: I see. - Wed Oct 28 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I don't know where you can go, But If this ends up being a war, I don't think you're crashing here every battle that occurs on Suna's soil. - Wed Oct 28 13:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Of course . . . I'll most likely be leaving. - Wed Oct 28 13:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So why are you here? - Wed Oct 28 13:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Cause she invited me for now. - Wed Oct 28 13:21:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Since that's basically the job i've given you. - Wed Oct 28 13:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Meanwhile, I will have my own things to do. - Wed Oct 28 13:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ... - Wed Oct 28 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) shifts his gaze towards her as she speaks, and since she was covered up by the pillow. He moved to sit beside her. "I see." Was all he stated.* - Wed Oct 28 13:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm beginning to reconsider it though . . . Since it's beginning to sound like you don't want me here anyway. - Wed Oct 28 13:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: By all means, Don't let me stop you. - Wed Oct 28 13:28:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's a 'really' good idea. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wish I could teach you but I haven't mastered that jutsu yet. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or I would. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's a very tricky jutsu. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I am still unsure if that was sarcastic or not. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No, it wasn't. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sips at his milk.* - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're my best friend Kilm. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I am not sure why learning a C rank was that tiring to him but nevermind. - Wed Oct 28 13:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: As for my safety. - Wed Oct 28 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'd honestly be safer with the raccoons. - Wed Oct 28 13:37:04 2015
