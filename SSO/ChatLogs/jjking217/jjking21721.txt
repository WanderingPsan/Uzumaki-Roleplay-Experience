<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I thank you.. - Sun Nov  1 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. We'll start with the easiest I suppose. - Sun Nov  1 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he took a deep breath and looked towards Lera as she performed the handseals necessary for the technique she was demonstrating to him, he took his time. And carefully watched as she used the technique, his eyes focused on her every movement, he watched her, the way the balls formed and shot forth, was actually startling. He knew he'd prefer not to be on the receiving side of this attack.

And slowly he watched as the jutsu broke apart after it's intended purpose had been completed...It was startling, but he nodded his head. Deciding it was time for him to attempt the technique himself, his hands raised to chest level, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale. He closed his eyes beginning to recall what seals she had performed. 

He typically enjoyed learning from Lera, he considered her a nice person. And he nodded his head, as he focused. His hands began to slowly replicate the movements she had made only moments before taking notice of her formation of seals and as he completed it, he immediately began to repeat the process, several times repeatedly he was trying to get this down pact so he'd be able to win.

He wasn't strong...He needed to make up for his weakness, so he'd try...This wasn't an easy technique...He couldn't ask the other person, he didn't want to risk it, she was fragile. Yet she continued to move through his mind, he inhaled once again.  He was beginning to feel as if it was time to attempt this attack so he braced himself for the worst while still hoping for the best.

He sighed to himself, he had to learn this for his sake and for the sake of another so he had begun to start applying his chakra into the mix, aiming to replicate the effects in which she had gotten from the technique by the process of sending it into the mud, he aimed to create a head of a dragon, that was his intention afterall. So he calmed himself, and went through the seals once again he would get this in a few moments or so he hoped.

As his hands were raised they began to move together in a series of handseals, before his chakra was sent out into the mud below their feet, and slowly a Dragon's head arose from the mud, opening it's maw, it began firing multiple balls of mud against some invisible opponent, after a moment, the dragon fell apart, and Index Sighed, nodding his head, he was happy. Looking to Lera he spoke "I think I got it."* - Sun Nov  1 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not bad. - Sun Nov  1 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Now...we come to the tougher one. - Sun Nov  1 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: This one, I will expect to be paid for. - Sun Nov  1 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: How much..? - Sun Nov  1 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I would normally ask for several million...would you like me to show the technique first? I'll let you decide. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Sure. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Actually. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I trust your judgement. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well I have to show you the technique so you have an idea of how it works first. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So. Allow me to demonstrate. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's also true. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as he looked as Lera, he was a bit stunned as he contemplated it as he spoke "This is your own personal technique...Isn't it? I wouldn't feel right, learning it from you. I don't deserve it." He stated, but he reached into his wallet he offered her five Million. 

"This is for the first one...Thanks. Lera, I can never truly repay you."* - Sun Nov  1 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: THe first one is a common technique. - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I only ask for payment for this technique. - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Even so. - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You didn't have to teach me - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Shrug* - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I enjoy passing techniques on - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyway, i'll explain how this works. - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiled a bit as he looked at the technique he was definately a bit stunned by such a thing. He knew two others who had learned this technique and he wondered if Kilm learned it from Lera, but he shook his head, Kilm was the one he had to kill so he had to push any thoughts of Kilm being a friend...An ally far from his mind, and he had to focus solely on what was before him, he nodded his head, and inhaled followed by a deep exhale. 

It was a seal less technique, which mad it a lot harder to learn and a lot easier to use, so he was pretty excited, his only problem was he wished that he was a bit faster, he'd be able to get the most out of this technique if he could make speedy escapes. But that wasn't a possibility as of yet so he had to focus, he had stuff he needed to focus on before he could work on his own core abilities, and that took priority over all else.

He smiled briefly, as his hands moved to chest level, in fact his chest was itchy so he proceeded to scratch it. The technique which could manipulate the gravity of something...Amazing, that was ll he could think, how Amazing Lera had to be to make this technique by herself. He whistled to himself, she seemed to have grasped a mastery over this technique, it was impressive.

He found everything about this technique to be attractive, it would enable him to see an entirely new world, and fly beside his friends, for Scouting purposes, it'd be idea, to scout from the shelter of the clouds. He was definately enjoying this very much. And Lera was a great teacher, he heard her words that it should be possible to reverse the effects by making the object heavier, and that did appeal to him greatly.

So he had decided that he had spent enough time staring at the technique, that he should probably get to actually attempting to use the Technique, that was probably ideal afterall, so he smiled to himself,  walking over to one of the trees, he closed his eyes, inhaling...Followed by a deep exhale, as his chakra began to gather, he wasn't sure entirely what he had to do, but he tried to focus on the tree, while gathering his chakra.

He had a lot to do and little time, he felt the coldness of the bark against his touch, and his eyes looked at the small lines which were etched onto the tree, which had survived god knows what kind of torture over the years, but he was focused. He kept his eyes closed and his senses focusing on the branch he touched, he figured the best thing to do would be to figure out how he should do this.

So as his hand remained on the wood, he inhaled followed by a light exhale, his chakra began to flare, as he concentrated...Focused on the wood against his hand, as he began subtly flowing his chakra into it. His focus piqued, and he tried to manipulate the weight of the branch, aiming to lesson it significantly. He concentrated, and focused this was going to be harder than most things he's tried so he had to focus.

He didn't move his hand off of the wood, and continued, his eyes remained closed and he focused on the sensation of the wood against his finger tips, the flowing of his chakra against his palm, as it was pushed into the wood 'force fed' he concentrated on manipulating it, taking away it's weight, which was definately harder than what it looked like. Because let's be honest...Lera made it look easy.

He took a deep breah and slowly, his chakra flared once again, and suddenly he felt the branch jerk, upon further look he saw the leaves, had begun to rise upward, as their weight was robbed from them, with a gentle pull the branch snapped, and began floating in mid air...He blinked, it was truly extroadinary. The sight of seeing the branch fly was almost -too- amazing.

He looked towards Lera and subsequently lost his focus as he spoke "I think I got the hang of it." He smiled at her, genuinely happy he had ran into her, he was happy she helped him, but he'd be eternally indebted to her,  he needed to make sure that this was what he wanted to do as to not waste the potential he had been given, but he bowed his head to Lera.* - Sun Nov  1 19:43:08 2015
