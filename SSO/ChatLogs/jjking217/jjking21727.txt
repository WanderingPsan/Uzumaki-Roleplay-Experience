<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nods.* - Sun Nov  8 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) decided it was time to sit down and focus, he was honestly beginning to believe that 'fission' release was completely different than he had anticipated. He was beginning to see this entire thing in a new light, the more he thought about it, the more he began to think about 'life', the combination of Earth and water...It'd create a life form would it not?

This revelation he began to wonder, What if it tied into nature? Gras...Trees---Wood! His mind was all over the place, but the thought of wood, definately intrigued him greatly. the act of creating such a substance, it'd be unprecendented. It excited him he wondered what would be the limitation for such an ability, there'd definately need to be.

As he continued to sit down he decided to go and purchase a book regarding wood, to his luck it focused on the scientific aspect, as he opened the book he began to read "In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species."He was definately intrigued by that so he continued reading.

" In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight."

He was finding this pretty good for reading and was excited he was making progress he decided that in a whilt this would be an ability he'd like to have mastered."In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion."

This tree known as hyperion, he'd love to visit it one day, but he knew this 'ability' if he managed to develop it would be startling in battle. Unprecendented, it'd lead him to an encounter much better and stronger opponents, but with such a thing readily available at his disposal, it'd give him an upper hand in battle, that couldn't easily be taken advantage of.

He was excited by the endless possibilities, it made him happy, truly happy. The potential was endless, he'd become a miniature King....IF he could make trees, he'd control life, He'd control everything, that power....Would be extroadinary. It made him happy, cracking his knuckles, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, this was going to be fun.

As he sat there flipping through the pages of the book, he wondered how much he had left, he definately had a bit more to go through, and he smiled running his tongue across his lips. He wondered how possible this hypothetical actually was, he figured it'd be interesting to find out. It excited him, inhaling followed by a brief exhale.

He decided to begin preparing these thoughts of his own that would give him the strength to do the impossible. Something that was never before seen or done, he was excited. Cracking his knuckles, he wondered what the first technique he'd be able to create. 

The possibilities were definately endless and that excited him, if given the chance to excell...He'd be strong enough to take on the gezo...Or more, He'd be able to destroy the gezo...Along with the serum he had created with the help  of Ume's DNA, He'd be....A god...That was inevitable.* - Mon Nov  9 00:35:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) took a deep breath, and made a single handseal, in which case his chakra was sent out around the entire building fairly easily, the male took several steps forward. Taking notice of the guard's position just in time to see Ai kill one of them, the young male sighed, wondering what he should do. And Ultimately, he decided picking them off from a distance would be much more rewarding. He was monitoring their movements via, his technique.

So when he stepped back his hands were raised to chest level, he began to gather and mould his chakra, he placed a hand against the wall, testing it's durability. Before he simply took a deep breath, and exhaled sharply, wind escaped his lips, in a small compressed ball of air, which had an astonishing amount of power, breaking through the wall effortlessly and fast, it was almost silent.

Within a moment's notice, a second ball was released with only a mili-second of lag between the two of them. Aimed at taking on both guards at once, having the ability to pierce through metal, he was sure the guard's were more than finished with a single motion. And a well placed Wind bullet to the skull. He took a deep breath before stepping back.

He figured he could provide support to Koji once he was actually in the room since he was monitoring his movements. * - Mon Nov  9 04:30:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a deep exhale, he was finding this to be fairly interesting. The concept of wood release, would have endless possibilities. Wood...The creation of wood, a release he'd have created himself just the thought excited him. It made him want to try it but for now he was...Thinking he had a lot to do afterall, and a lot of room to progress. All that was left was to actually do what was intended..

He knew that the process of creating trees, would definately be a component of Earth with aspects of water, he nodded his head. It'd be intriguing so he focused and continued thinking, the possibilities would be practically endless, it'd be something he'd like to advance once he knew if it was possible but there was other things he needed to do at the same time. He ran his tongue across his lips and nodded.

There was a lot he could do to prepare himself, so it was actually inevitable that he'd be led down such a path, and he was happy. He wondered where it'd lead him,  so he continued to focus, and focus, he had to, it'd make life a lot easier, so he concentrated on the path which lay before him, and he tried to come up with ideas for techniques which would align themselves with this method.

He smiled, as his eyes looked around, he figured it'd be fairly easy to make quite a lot of progress, so that's just what he'd attempt to do make progress and a lot. Just having come up with the idea, had placed him in a position of being interested, a single hand moved through his hair as he inhaled followed by a brief exhale, he felt like he was on the verge of greatness.* - Tue Nov 10 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) after a while he inhaled followed by a brief exhale, and decided to relax upon a chair. He was pretty bored as of late without Katsune being around, but she had her things to do, so he began doing his own, he hoped that when she returned they'd be able to pick up where they left off, he chuckled subtly, maybe he'd even have this wood release thing down?* - Tue Nov 10 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) slowly sighed "Five thousand more..." He said to himself in disbelief. But deciding if he was truly to learn Kenjutsu...He couldn't give up, he didn't have the leisure of quiting his job quitting this lifestyle he made for himself. Then again, even if he could he wouldn't he enjoyed this risky lifestyle so much. He raised his blade swinging down. 

"One." 

He spoke, he sighed this would be a while. He could half-ass it, but he'd get nothing out of it. So he decided to put in the time for the work. Raising his blade he swung it down again. Continuing this process, so many times he stopped counting. But he still had a while to go, everytime he considered himself close to being finish he told himself. 

"One Hundred more." 

This motivated him to do more, raising his blade he swung it down, it was becomming basic muscle movements, he wasn't thinking about it. He was just doing the same action over and over again. With each swing his movements were more fluent. 

Not complaining, his arms ached they hurt. But he refused to stop, he was easily exceeding his limits but he didn't give up. Upon hearing that he had to do Ten thousand more he almost fell over at just the thought. 

"I'll control my Darkness....Once I am able to my flames will Shine brighter than they've ever have." 

He smiled, he recieved his second wind. Raising his blade, he swung it down, he was moving fluently. Stopping just before he hit the ground, the aching in his muscles showing but it was obvious that his muscle tissue was tearing and repearing. 

He was getting stronger, he was learning the blade better. He'd do this, he'd be able to he'd definately be able to. He'd get stronger, super strong...He'd get unstoppable. As he continued swining his blade, he was lost in his own thoughts, "I'll do this." 

His movements had become basic muscle memory, he wasn't even realising he was doing this. It was just happening, he let it happened his muscles twitched it hurt -alot-. He didn't care, his heart was racing. 

His arms continued to move up and down, he couldn't feel his arms anymore. There was no pain, there was no tire. He just knew what he had to do, he just kept moving on nothing would stop him. 

He commited himself to learning this art, he would see it through to the end. His feet stayed in their same position, he had done so many slashes...He couldn't remember, it felt like he had been doing it forever. 

He knew he probably looked crazy but oh well, he did what he had to. Once he had assumed he did enough, he panted. Falling to his knees, as he inhaled and exhaled. Taking a slight break. * - Tue Nov 10 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) slowly sighed he wouldn't complain he had resolved himself not to. Just doing as he was told, his Bokken continuing to be raised over his head before swinging it downwards, he wouldn't give up he was feeling stronger. Her felt like his movements were becoming fluent. 

This was good, but it was time for him to try a bit more. Bokken in hand, he shifted his grip on it. Adjusting it a bit, so he was holding it with two hands but hoping to maximize the output on strength. Raising it into the air, before he thrusted downwards. He couldn't feel nor see the ripping of his mucle tissue but he felt it reparing itself making him all the more stronger. 

After he had finished the set once again, he looked up towards the sky and sighed to himself.* - Tue Nov 10 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) slowly sighed, as he closed his eyes allowing his crimson pupils to surface, as he stared ahead. His single shard, spinning rapidly while circling around the center pupil. He sighed deciding it was time to practice with his Bokken, raising it above his head before swinging it downwards. Raising it again, before repeating the process. 

He was taking his time making sure he did each swing to the best of his abilities, this was painstacking work but he would not give up. He had missed quite a few days and he had to catch up somewhere, this was going to be a long day. His Bokken gripped tightly, as he raised it up, before swinging down, this time it hit the dirt. 

Sighing, he raised his arms, doing it again, and again. Painstacking work, after about A Thousand swings, his arms began to hurt, but regardless, he continued to work on taking no chances he had a lot he needed to do. He wouldn't give up on this training. 

Hours passed, his body ached but he continued, he wouldn't stop He wanted to do One Hundred Thousand, even if his arms felt like they were going to fall off he'd continue. Smiling, until he was unable to stand collapsing to his knees. Covered in sweat and panting.


He'd slowly sighed standing from his sitting position, as he walked beside the table grabbing his Bokken in his hands, raising it over his head, before swinging downwards, the blade stopping moments before it touched the ground. He sighed, raising it again, before repeating the process. 

He figued he'd try it to the best of his abilities, get as much done as he could, Fifty Thousand swings. He released a slight laugh.

"I fear not the man who knows Ten thousand Techniques, but the man who practices One Technique Ten Thousand times." 

Even so, his bokken was aligned with the ground, as he raised it above his head, before swinging it down once again, it was apparent this movement had been currently commited to muscle movement. It was becomming second nature, he did it with relative ease. 

Though he continued it over and over again, not wasting a single movement. Every so often his Bokken's tip hit the ground, causing him to sigh. But he continued on, hoping to perfect his timing, as he raised his Bokken. Before swinging it downwards once again, he was trying to get as close to perfection as he possibly could. 

He'd have to step up his game, he did have a very important fight comming up. He continued moving his blade, his muscles were beginning to ache, but nothing he hadn't experienced Many...Many times before, only a single bead of sweat formed on his face. But this did not cause any slowing in his movements, he continued to swing his Bokken, arcing it downwards.

Timing it so it stopped, just centimeters off the surface of the ground, he got to the point he didn't count anymore, just stopped when he felt like he had done a considerable amount of work, and finished his quota.
