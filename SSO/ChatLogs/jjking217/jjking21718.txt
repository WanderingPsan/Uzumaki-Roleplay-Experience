<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you have a dirty way to kill her I suggest doing it. That's my judgement whenever someone makes theatrical, pretentious, passive-aggressive threats. - Fri Oct 30 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You see. . . - Fri Oct 30 02:16:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hearing you talk about killing as you cuddle a pillow in the bed. - Fri Oct 30 02:17:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Talking about it. . . - Fri Oct 30 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Makes me 'want' to cuddle this pillow. - Fri Oct 30 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's why I'm always wanting to cuddle with you. You make me wanna murder. - Fri Oct 30 02:18:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) scratched his cheek as he asked "You plan on staying in for the rest of the night..?" He asked curiously.* - Fri Oct 30 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. It's best I relax when I'm like this. - Fri Oct 30 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because I have to think before I speak or act. - Fri Oct 30 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I like to be alone and safe while I think. - Fri Oct 30 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's part of the game. - Fri Oct 30 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he slowly stood, and slowly he began undoing the sash fo his shirt, before his pants. Leaving him in nothing but his underwear, she may've noticed had she been paying attention. He seemed to have been picking up 'some' muscle tone, showing he had started working out more proficiently since they started dating. Not to mention the spiraling Dragon Tattoo on his chest, as he slowly approached the bed. 

He took a deep breath, and inhaled, before he lifted the covers and aimed to slip beneath them.* - Fri Oct 30 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as he slipped into the covers, he pulled them over his body, before he relaxed, placing his arms behind his head, as he looked towards Kat whose face was hidden by that of the pillow as he spoke "The failsafe, I added, will compromise any 'added' effects of the weapons they have...And in which case will render them normal weapons."* - Fri Oct 30 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) slowly he inched a bit closer to her as he turned on his side, to face her. As he spoke "I'm debating if I should buy you a 'Cat pillow'." He stated with a light chuckle.* - Fri Oct 30 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Tell me about this failsafe though. - Fri Oct 30 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What is it exactly? - Fri Oct 30 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her as she turned and ultimately he decided to wait a moment, before he spoke "Basically,  I pay some extra money, and the Blacksmith makes it so if the blade is used against me. All of it's abilities will be nullified, take that guy for example, he had holes put in the blade, so that when swung, the sound that was created by air passing through would create intense nausea,  But if he used it against me, The holes would close up...Rendering it...a normal blade. It seems like something only the Gezo would manage."* - Fri Oct 30 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sounds. . . . - Fri Oct 30 02:35:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If you're lucky. - Fri Oct 30 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And I'm completely unlucky. - Fri Oct 30 02:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Fri Oct 30 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kirigakure. . . - Fri Oct 30 02:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wait. - Fri Oct 30 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) whistles as he simply spoke "I may have money, but I'm not 'that' rich, Though Kirigakure's army is forming, I'm sure they'd think twice before attacking me. Considering I'm one of the top donaters, to that village." He stated, looking at Kat's T-Shirt, before his eyes found her face as he spoke:

"Plus....I figured there was something...Much better to spend my money on." He stated, nodding his head, an almost childish gleam showed in his eyes.* - Fri Oct 30 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I picked selectively. - Fri Oct 30 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Her must trusted shinobi. - Fri Oct 30 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sighed as he sat up looking to Katsune as he simply stated "Yeah, That's just the start though. The Mizukage had things she 'needed me to stay in the village for an extended period of time for'." He stated looking to Katsune, as he sighed a bit.

"It wasn't intentional, I just I don't know.." He responded to her saying he withheld information.* - Fri Oct 30 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Thought.... - Fri Oct 30 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This entire time.... - Fri Oct 30 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That you were probably hiding a whole lot from me. - Fri Oct 30 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Never minded though. - Fri Oct 30 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Well, not the whole time. - Fri Oct 30 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I started trusting you at one point. - Fri Oct 30 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: .... - Fri Oct 30 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Are you saying you don't trust me, Kat? - Fri Oct 30 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as Kat suddenly crawlled onto his lap. feeling her rear planted on him, and her hands on his shoulder, a faint reddening of his cheeks could be detected as he was pushed down onto the bed.  Looking at her as she spoke, he swallowed hard, looking up and into her eyes if permitted.* - Fri Oct 30 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sighed a bit, he knew there was a line he couldn't cross...And he couldn't lie to her face as he simply stated "Yeah...Mostly about some adventures I've went on, and the people I've met." He admitted, as he stared into her eyes, he didn't enjoy keeping secrets.* - Fri Oct 30 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Fri Oct 30 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But like before...I'll tell you whatever you want to know. - Fri Oct 30 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're. . . - Fri Oct 30 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Dead. - Fri Oct 30 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: -omit-0 - Fri Oct 30 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt the pressure she was applying to his shoulders, as her legs closed around his body. He looked up to her and swallowed, before his gaze shifted slightly off to the side "I'm...Sorry.." He muttered looking up to her, though he didn't seem eager to make eye contact.* - Fri Oct 30 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So. . . - Fri Oct 30 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Now that I know about the lying. . . - Fri Oct 30 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wonder where Saeza comes into all of this. - Fri Oct 30 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) his eyes widened a bit as she placed her fist over his heart, he closed his eyes. As he laid his head back, he didn't say anything for a good while as he simply stated. 

"There are things...I haven't told you, I don't think of them as lies Kat." 

He simply stated, he knew if she intended to harm him, it was going to happen no matter what he did. He opened his eyes after a minute staring back into her eyes.* - Fri Oct 30 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Fri Oct 30 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) realised that this was probably the way this all was destined to end up. As he simply stated "I went with Fujitora, to this Maze of his. For about a Week a while back. It was a contest, to see who would be trained by him, Me, Kilm, and Sanoke Participated. I came in first, And he made me an offer." He looked away, as his gaze found the Dragon tattoo on his chest.

"He offered me some power. about Six Months ago. I was to naive, at the time, And I didn't ask the questions I should've." He stated, as he relaxed on the bad. "I also didn't tell you, Susumu's Aunt, didn't care if he was dead.She didn't care about the charges bought up against him. Or maybe....That Hideki used me as a means to commit Suicide? The things I -haven't- told you were because, I didn't know how you'd think about me if I did. If you'd hate me or doubt me, Mostly because. I hoped we wouldn't end up in this situation."

He stated, staring into her eyes, for the first time he didn't break eye contact. He accepted this moment, if she was going to kill him he was dead. But he'd be truthful with her at least in these moments.* - Fri Oct 30 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anything else? - Fri Oct 30 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah, I just want to say this if you really are going to blow a hole in my chest. - Fri Oct 30 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah....? - Fri Oct 30 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: These last....Three months, have been the best of my life. I don't regret a single moment of the time I've spent with you. - Fri Oct 30 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) let out a sigh of relief, as he seemed to relax for the most part---Though he seemed ready to tense at a moment's notice as her hands rested on either side of his head, as he looked up at her . 

"I told you...I wouldn't keep any secrets...That's a promise, I intend to come through with." He stated, maintaining eye contact, but he was definately happy, he wasn't going to have a hole in his chest, Maybe he could apply to be an Espada if she did.* - Fri Oct 30 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Listen. - Fri Oct 30 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I want to be Hokage. - Fri Oct 30 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That goal is everything to me. - Fri Oct 30 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's the reason I'm not with Edge, slaughtering tons of people for no reason other than a rush. - Fri Oct 30 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's the -only-. . .reason. - Fri Oct 30 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And our goals probably don't mix well. - Fri Oct 30 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So. - Fri Oct 30 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you want to keep secrets? - Fri Oct 30 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's fine. - Fri Oct 30 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Doesn't bother me. - Fri Oct 30 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Even if you're killing thousands. - Fri Oct 30 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just. . . - Fri Oct 30 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Tell me things in detail in the future. - Fri Oct 30 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If my life is in danger, let me know. - Fri Oct 30 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My life, or my claim on Konoha. - Fri Oct 30 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: With Kirigakure, you didn't let me know at all. - Fri Oct 30 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You gave me vague information I couldn't act on. - Fri Oct 30 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm sorry Kat, It wasn't my goal to be so vague..But In the future, I'll be sure to tell you everything if it endangers you or Konoha. - Fri Oct 30 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) he looked up at her, and sighed briefly. Before his frown, turned into a small grin. She was right, and  it was probably safer if she knew about any threats pertaining to herself or Konoha, but his hands raised to find her hips. Where they'd rest as he looked up at her he wondered if he could change the topic briefly as he spoke "There's one more thing, I haven't been quite detailed about.." He stated looking into her eyes.* - Fri Oct 30 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) simply spoke "I haven't been specific on what, I like about you." As he simply spoke, "Everything about you, From your beauty, to your intellegence, your voice." He paused as he developed a faint reddening of his cheeks, as he spoke "The softness of your skin, and your personality.---Although the later usually ends up with be in agonizing pain." He joked a bit, looking up to her as his hands remained where they were on her hips.* - Fri Oct 30 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as her arms went beneath his own, as she hugged him. Feeling her head upon his chest. As she wiggled into place, he'd slowly move to transition, as his arms wrapped around her back, if permitted as he simply spoke:

"Then we should really change that." He stated, in regards to her boredom, as he offered a warm smile.* - Fri Oct 30 03:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That she wanted to use you to kill the Mizukage? Seems like that might have him asking questions we don't wanna answer. - Fri Oct 30 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That she attacked you, and what happened was in self-defense. - Fri Oct 30 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He'll wanna know why. He can't believe she attacked me in the first place if he doesn't know why she did it. - Fri Oct 30 03:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Maybe a kiss...Or something special~? - Fri Oct 30 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmmm. - Fri Oct 30 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Fri Oct 30 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Close your eyes. - Fri Oct 30 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) closes his eyes against better judgement, as he awaited what was to come.* - Fri Oct 30 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) kept his eyes closed for the entirety, as he heard the sounds which resemebled buttons, he felt her moving atop of him and the shaking of the bed. He felt something thin graze against his flesh, which was later to be identified as the fabric of her shirt. After a moment, he smelled an a beautiful aroma, which filled his nostrils, which he probably identified fairly easy considering they were around eachother often.

He felt something warm and almost fluffy, around his face, and the sensation of something light resting atop of his head, before Kat's arms wrapped around him, pulling him in a bit closer. He swallowed hard, as he heard Katsune's words, and slowly his eyes opened. Revealing the spot in which his face had called home in this moment, and his face lit up.

He felt his arousal definately mounting by the moment, embracing the sensation of Katsune's soft breasts against his face. Before he planted a kiss on her chest, where he was currently being embraced by. This was certainly great incentive, but his focus had definately transitioned from one topic to the next.* - Fri Oct 30 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was surprised by the size of her breasts, it was one thing when he saw them from a small distance. But being up close, he was almost awestricken, he felt something which was hard, yet at the same time soft rub against his lips. And as his gaze lowered it was identified as her nipple, and with her movements, he felt it rubbing back and forth against his mouth, as her lower body grinded against his crotch, which had a bulge that was rapidly growing beneath her.

He resisted the strong urge, to take her nipple into his mouth. He definately wanted to, and he would've if it wasn't for her question as he spoke "N-No, Not y-yet...I-I think I n-need another minute or so." He stated, with a light gasp, as a result of her movements.* - Fri Oct 30 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) ultimately gave in, as he opened his mouth to bring in her nipple. As he did, he did what came almost natural and began lightly suckling on it. His heart was racing, and she'd be able to feel the heat of his breath, as his breathing grew heavier.  And as she began grinding against him more aggressively, he leaned forward, practically burying himself onto her breast further. Releasing a a sound that could be considered a mixture of a gasp out of surprise, and a light moan. Which was greatly suppressed.

He heard her words, but they seemed almost second in his priorities at the moment, the sensations of her moving sending a delightful sensation which radiated throughout his crotch, he felt a tension growing the more she moved. And the ideas which were going through his head, were all fairly good, though extremely few actually had to deal with the topic at hand.* - Fri Oct 30 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) feels Katsune's movements comming to a stop as her chin rested atop of his head, and slowly he began suckling a bit harder, running his tongue over her nipple as it was held in his mouth.  His heart seemed to beating to it's own symphony, which was wild and untamed, he felt his body heating up and the tension growing.

He felt Katsune's hand grasp his wrist before it was ushered over to her butt, and he felt her bare bottom against his palm. The sensation was almost unmatched,and unconciously he gave her bottom a light squeeze as she held his hand there. He agreed with her words, but by no means did he intend to put a stop to this himself he was in his own world.* - Fri Oct 30 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her arm return to being wrapped around his head, keeping him where he was. His suckling on her nipple didn't ease up at all, as she spoke. His tongue gently swirled around her nipple. Before he stopped only briefly, to catch his breath, allowing cold air to hit her nipple after being coated in his saliva for a moment. Before he eagerly returned to his duty.

His left hand began to gently rub  her bare bottom, with circular motions, followed by the occasional squeeze, his actions definately giving her the reply of "Let them".* - Fri Oct 30 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after a few more moments of suckling, it seemed like he'd exhausted his reserves. Feeling Katsune's face moving against his hair. He slowly released her nipple from his grasp, slowly his mind began to refocus. But his hand remained on her butt for a moment as he leaned forward to plant a kiss on the breast he was just suckling on. Before resting his cheek against it as he spoke "I think...I have an idea.." He stated between heavy breaths.* - Fri Oct 30 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) rubbed his cheek against her chest once again as he simply spoke "She was Susumu's girlfriend wasn't she...? And you said he had a strange ability which made her fall for him, If you don't want to tell him the truth about the Mizukage...Then why not say you saw a similarity in her characteristics, but instead of love...It was aggression? You could say that you had no other choice, but to defend yourself which resulted in her untimely passing. If there's a technique that causes love...It's well within the realm of possibilities there'd be one for hate. And Susumu and his girlfriend did visit Amegakure where she talked with the 'Queen' alone." He mentioned almost subconciously, as his hand moved from her butt falling to the side, he had mentioned another bit of information that probably would've been more useful earlier.* - Fri Oct 30 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Fri Oct 30 05:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watches as she pulls her shirt down, as he simply sighed before he began to speak:

"You could say that she blamed.....Y-You for not being t-there to stop Susumu's attack, and she felt as if it was your fault for not preventing it. So she tried to get revenge, by attacking you."* - Fri Oct 30 05:17:00 2015

"I'm Index."* - Fri Oct 30 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) couldn't help by how resolved she sounded when she spoke. As he spoke "Yeah,  Yeah." Nodding his head,  this same speech he got often, before he felt her grasp his hand, taking notice of her firm grip.  It was probably impossible for him to feel any more insecure about his physical strength, although he wasn't out there with it, his handshake was firm, but it was definately that of an average Teen, much less a trained Killer. "Chikyu? A nice name. It means 'Earth'." He paused as he spoke "If I recall correctly, If anything it fits the path of a swordsman." He stated pausing briefly, as she shook his hand.

As his free hand found his head he rubbed it as he spoke "Sorry about babling."* - Fri Oct 30 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her hand slap his back causing him to lean forward as the 'stinging' sensation radiated from her point of impact. "Give me a good book, And I'll be set." He admitted, he did enjoy reading as he spoke: "Your dad seems like a wise man, and he definately got the 'strong' part right."

He complained, though he was still joking,  he aimed to had she allowed him once he grabbed her first hand, take her second hand in his own. "Let's dance~."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as they entered the hotsprings, he paid the owners extra money to clear the place out. Before he carried Nina to the changing room, and set her down as he spoke "It's definately good for relaxing. If you have a bathing suit, feel free to put it on, though if you don't there's really no one else here besides the staff. So you should be fine." He stated lightly, as he looked at one of the bens which had been set up to hold clothes, he pulled one down, and offered it to Nina.* - Fri Oct 30 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) slowly did the same, as he yawned subtly, walking behind her. He was also in his underwear for the sake of decency, though he had expected her to wear a shirt, not that he minded. But slowly he moved into the water, taking a seat beside her as he closed his eyes. "Ah...That feels good." He stated, feeling the warmness of the water beginning to help ease some formed tension, as he shifted a glance towards Nina, as he spoke.

"I realised, I don't really know much about you Nina, like...What's your favorite color?" He asked.

If she cared to look, she'd probably notice the spiraling Dragon Tattoo he had on his chest.* - Sat Oct 31 00:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) scooted closer to Nina, as he aimed to wrap his arm around her shoulders, pulling her a bit closer, in a sort of half-hug. As he simply stated "I'm sorry about that Nina, I'll be around more. I promise." He stated looking down to her.* - Sat Oct 31 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) simply sighed at her words, as he'd keep his arm around her, attempting to rest his chin atop of her head gently as he spoke "I'll be around for a while longer though, You don't have to worry.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nods his head as he slowly reached for a small tray which was conviently there, as he spoke "Uh, turn around and face me." He stated lightly, motioning for her to face him in the water, as the tray was set atop of the water's surface. Placing two dice upon it as he spoke "The only game, I know is "Chicken, If you want to play that. It can get fairly interesting."* - Sat Oct 31 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Well basically, it's a game to get your opponent to back out. - Sat Oct 31 00:34:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Sounds complicated. - Sat Oct 31 00:35:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) shook his head as he laughed subtly as he spoke "I was supposed to do it,  You roll for the action you're doing to the other person." He explained, deciding it probably should've explained this earlier. As he placed the dice on the tray, allowing her turn to commence.* - Sat Oct 31 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he extended his leg to her as he spoke "Have at it~." He spoke lightly, smiling, he was happy he was at the very least play a game with Nina as he spoke "After five turns, we should switch up the body parts." He suggested, realising that if they played that long, It might get repetitive.* - Sat Oct 31 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) whinced a bit as her fingers clamped down against his flesh beneath the water. As he muttered "Ouch." Seeing her sticking her tongue out, he couldn't help but laugh for a bit. As he reached for the dice, deciding to give them another shot.* - Sat Oct 31 01:06:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sighed a bit, but it was a happy sigh as he leaned forward. His hands finding her leg in order to support it, as he extended his tongue, running it across her leg. Before he spoke "There you go!" As he looked to her sticking his tongue out at her in a teasing manner.* - Sat Oct 31 01:11:40 2015
