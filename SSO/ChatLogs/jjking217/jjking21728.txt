<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) didn't release her ankle, and with a single motion, he'd attempt to make her lose her balance. He was currently getting a really good idea, had he knocked her to the ground. He'd attempt to move to place a leg atop of her as he spoke:

This is why I can't stand people, Make one joke about Sex. And -everyone- loses their heads." His gaze looked towards Hanai he hadn't fired the technique it didn't seem like he had the intention to,  not unless she continued with her attempt to  'throw him'...Then he'd be angry.* - Tue Nov 10 02:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) raises his leg, and within a moments notice he was standing as he simply spoke "Damn, I thought people had a sense of humor. Make one joke about people with the foot fetish, And she loses her fucking head!" He vents, not sounding all to annoyed at all, he found it comical afterall.* - Tue Nov 10 02:25:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) sipped at his glass of water as he simply spoke "And If I have an alternative?" He asked checking her face for any shifts in expressions  "A way for you to stay with Ortho,  And for them to work on what they have to?" He asked, he didn't want to take her from Ortho, even how mad he was at Ortho he wouldn't want to seperate them for that long.* - Tue Nov 10 20:40:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) stood up, as he scratched his chin, debating if he should locate a base closer to Konoha, so that it wouldn't be a problem. But that'd be money, he shrugged, before running a hand through his hair.  Pulling his face mask back up, he motioned to the door with a nod of his head.* - Tue Nov 10 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) had led her on a long journey, which even required a boat ride.  After they had arrived on the isolated army, they were greeted by a Squadron of Guards wearing all black, complete with flak jackets and Jumpsuits, with a wave of the hand. They returned to their duties, and Index led her to a massive building, upon entering through the front door, there were numerous rooms and other facilities, but he led her down stairs and to a fairly large room, which would be identified as a bedroom. The walls were white, there was a single bed, and several wardrobes with clothes, along with a closet. There were practically rows of clothes, there was also a full bathroom as he spoke "This...Is your living quarters for now, If you'd like, I can have someone down here paint the walls, or even buy you stuff to make it more comfortable." He offered, She probably would've noticed on the floor he led her to, there were countless scientists, along with a large number of Guards. This place seemed akin to an armed fortress. 

She probably would've noticed the Kunai launchers, and the expansive armory on the way down.* - Tue Nov 10 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her as he motioned towards the bed, He himself would take a seat at the foot of the bed as he spoke "I have no problem supplying you with plants, and I like both equally. So whether you change or not is up to you." As he sat on the bed, his hood followed by his facemask were removed, showing his hair was actually dyed white, except for his roots which retained his black color.* - Tue Nov 10 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head to her comment about his hair as he spoke "I had to change it a bit, to infiltrate Sunagakure." He admitted, knowing there actually wasn't anyone who could find out at this point, and when they were done here, whether or not she told anyone wouldn't make a difference as he simply stated.:

"They'd probably first run some basic tests on  you, get Samples,  Watch how you interact for a few days or so. Eventually, they'll probably begin seeing how your body reacts to chemical stimulation, different types of chemicals to induce different emotions--Since Human emotions are just a series of chemical reactions and repsonses."* - Tue Nov 10 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Of course he isn't going to be here all the time but will he be gone all the time? Me alone with scientists and guards. - Tue Nov 10 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) shrugs as he spoke "I'm not a scientist myself, they'll find a way." He admitted, he knew little to nothing about how their process went as he spoke "I will, as much as I am able to. And of course, when you want company. I won't be far away. I'll probably be doing work a floor above,  and If I'm not I'll be here as soon as possible."* - Tue Nov 10 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It is ironic, but once all is said and done, You can be with him for as long as you wish. - Tue Nov 10 22:56:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I found out things about her feelings and their break up and everything really. - Tue Nov 10 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: And how she's trying to get him back. - Tue Nov 10 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I told him to be with her at any point I'm here if he needs to... or wants to... of course he said he wouldn't but that was expected. - Tue Nov 10 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: That's actually the most important thing I told him other than how long I was going to be gone. - Tue Nov 10 23:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ....bravery is an emotion. - Tue Nov 10 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Just like jealousy. - Tue Nov 10 23:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: And honestly it needed to be said. - Tue Nov 10 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I wonder if that's true. - Tue Nov 10 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: If what is true? - Tue Nov 10 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: That you said that because you have no fear. - Tue Nov 10 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: If you had no fear, normally one would've not said anything. - Tue Nov 10 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: You wouldn't even have said goodbye. - Tue Nov 10 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Maybe the problem isn't a lack of emotions, it's that your body can't process them. - Tue Nov 10 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Everything I did when talking to him before leaving, was for his benefit. - Tue Nov 10 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Why would someone who didn't care do something for someone else's benefit? - Tue Nov 10 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: And not saying anything would just be the fact you might be scared of saying goodbye. Ortho was afraid to say goodbye, he had me say I'll see him later. - Tue Nov 10 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Probably because of the one thing I left out telling both of you that makes me complete. - Tue Nov 10 23:11:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I left out about that the last thing that makes me complete is an owner. I'm a weapon, weapon's are owned. My previous owner didn't want me for whatever reason but couldn't figure out how to kill me.  - Tue Nov 10 23:14:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her back, as she slowly began to remove her clothing, after a moment his gaze shifted to the ground in front of him. He didn't see a need to tell her to strip completely they probably had no need for her to be completely stripped at the moment.  As he gave her one final look asking "Are you ready?" He asked, tapping the bed beside him, he didn't care if she was emotionless...Eccentric people tended to be...'overwhealming'.* - Tue Nov 10 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) stood up before heading to the door, "She's ready." He uttered, and almost immediately the sound of foot steps could be heard. As he returned to Owari's side, taking a seat beside her. After a moment there was a knock at the door, before it was pushed in, two doctors one male, one female entered the room looking at Owari. The woman, had glasses on, while the male seemed to be in desperate need for a shave. Pulling in a cart they pulled it into the room.

"Hello there! My name is Dr. Takashino!" Declared the woman. In a cheery voice, she had long black hair that fell past the center of her back.

"Dr. Yukimura." Stated the male in quite a lack luster tone, as he was preparing several utensils.* - Tue Nov 10 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) raised a hand over his mouth to stifle the oncomming laughter. 

The male simply stated "Don't worry, I didn't intend to." He seemed to definately be having a sour day, as he began to put on a set of gloves.

The woman did the same but replied differently. "Don't say that!" She spoke, in an excited by saddened tone. "I'm really happy to meet you!" She exclaimed offering a wide smile, as Yukimura handed her a few Utensils, and she pranced over in front of Ume. Raising the first of the utensils, as she spoke "I want to check your eyes~!" She stated, looking definately intrigued, and possibly enjoying her job to much.* - Tue Nov 10 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ...My eye's aren't really eyes. - Tue Nov 10 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm the same everywhere. - Tue Nov 10 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: My dialation is faked. - Tue Nov 10 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: My iris is faked. - Tue Nov 10 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: Everything is faked. - Tue Nov 10 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: This is me. - Tue Nov 10 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||The woman's eyes widened in a fierce desire for knowledge, as she moved closer and without any hesitation aimed to grasp one of Owari's arms even despite the transformation, she seemed to only be more interested in what had occured. Meanwhile the male had backed against the wall in disbelief. "H-How!?" He exlaimed, definately shocked. His heart could definately be heard from across the room.

The woman stared at Ume's eyes studying them with a great intensity.* - Tue Nov 10 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) || The woman looked at Owari's arms feeling the soft texture as she spoke "Wow! That's amazing." Moving a single hand along the length of Owari's arm, before she asked "Could you open your mouth?" She asked curiously reaching for a utensil that would help her observe Owari's mouth should she be permitted.* - Tue Nov 10 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: .... - Tue Nov 10 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Why do they feel so idiotic when they are suppose to be the most intelligent people? - Tue Nov 10 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||Once Owari opened her mouth, the female began checking her teeth, rubbing a finger against them, aiming to feel their texture, density. She seemed definately intrigued, as she asked "Are you able to produce Saliva if you need it?" She asked curiously, as a single finger explored Owari's inner cheek.* - Wed Nov 11 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't need it. - Wed Nov 11 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: And my teeth are made out of the same thing as the rest of me. - Wed Nov 11 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at Owari as she nodded her head before retracting her hand as she spoke "Might we get a tissue Sample?" She asked curiously, still on the excited side,  but she needed to know what they were working with. Her eyes stared into Owari's own as she spoke "Tomorrow, I'd like a more...Indepth look if possible? Owari-chan?" She asked offering a smile.* - Wed Nov 11 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||Released an audible gasp as she pulled off her finger, and the woman reached for the balled up limb, before quickly she ushered it over to something that'd keep the sample preserved as she nodded her head at Owari's words, before she kneeled before the woman "Just because I'm a scientist doesn't mean we can't be friends! And please, Call me Asumi!" She stated, with a nod of her head. Before she skipped off, taking the sample as well as the other male who had been in awe, they exited the room leaving the two of them as she looked back in:

"I'm always focused!" Would've been heard, before the door closed.* - Wed Nov 11 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||The woman even in light of her words, she didn't skip a beat, but she did gasp once again as the finger egrew before heading off.* - Wed Nov 11 00:19:12 2015

"This tension, pain, and suffering. Competition...Ends today."* - Wed Nov 11 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) reaches into his pocket, he unsealed a piece of paper. With the list of every person who had signed Hideki's scroll...In fact, it was the summoning scroll itself. And with a burst of chakra it was ignited, and began to burn away.

"I don't intend to fight, It is beneficial to neither you nor me."* - Wed Nov 11 21:01:39 2015
