<br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took a deep breath once again, feeling his lungs. His blonde hair subtly swayed with every movement he made. As he spoke "Scientists, You will continue working on assisting Yuriko with her problems. And at the same time...You have begun writing notes on a device which would enable humans to take flight. Continue upon that, We will be taking this base to a new Era." As he inhaled followed by a brief exhale:

"Winter is comming, the farmers need to increase production. Enough food to last us through those times, and the engineers need to make sure the base stays warm. Medics, stock up on medication. And finally, The Guards, we will tighten security around the base, any boats that draw near are to be sunk using the Kunai launchers. Their crew bought and stored until further notice." 

His traversed the first row of people "These will be hard, and troubling times. But we aren't weak. We will survive, we will flourish. And when all is said and done, we will be on top." He stated, before motioning to the front of the stage:

"All who wish to apply for the position of General step forward."* - Mon Nov 23 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at the numerous people who had lined up. And for a good Fourty five minutes, he denied applicants left and right. Until he got to Yori, he examined his appearance, from head to toe, as he spoke "Name, Age, Current Status, And why do you believe you should hold this position?" He asked, his voice was calculating, but it also had a certain 'passion'. As he stared at Yori, he examined him from head to toe.* - Mon Nov 23 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Family. - Mon Nov 23 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared at Yori, he looked deep into his eyes, and his gaze pierced at his soul. It certainly wasn't one of a Human as he spoke "And what about if you fail? When you fail? What then? What will you do?" He asked, unlike the rest of them, he had gotten to the second part of questioning. He was curious as to his reply.* - Mon Nov 23 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: If I fail? I will take direct punishment. The leader, will decide what punishment should be given to me.  - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I eat people who I punish. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Then I will be eaten. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I like him. - Mon Nov 23 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he stood, motioning for one of the guards to come to his side. "You'd accept death, If we order it, Yori son of Requiem?"* - Mon Nov 23 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 23 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) he motioned for Yori to approach the podium, as he commanded the guard to hand him his sword. "So be it." He stated, as he grasped the hilt of the blade, extending it out with the tip pointed at Yori's head, "Then I'll take your head." His gaze was cold, and every word he stated, sounded as if he was prepared to kill him here and now. And startled gasps could be heard by the people watching. "Kneel, and accept your fate."* - Mon Nov 23 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: OOooouhh.~ - Mon Nov 23 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) raised his blade, as he spoke "Then I suppose, this is goodbye." He stated, as the blade was shot forward, aimed at Yori's neck. The intent seemed as if it was to cut the male's head clean off, but the moment the edge of the blade, touched Yori's neck. It stopped, remaining against his neck, he desired to see Yori's reaction as he spoke:

"They say, a man reveals his true colors in his final moments. Who exactly is the male known as Yori? What composes him?" Asked the male, as he stared down at Yori, his face was expressionless. His gaze was piercing, he wanted to see Yori's expression in the face of death.* - Mon Nov 23 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) offered the blade back to the guard, as he closed his eyes. "Life?" He repeated, as he spoke "Stand Yori child of Requiem." He looked towards Yuriko, releasing a small chuckle. "You're interesting." His gaze shifted upwards to the crowd "You're all dismissed."And everyone began to leave in this moment, hordes of people exiting the place as he looked down at Yori.* - Mon Nov 23 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared at Yori as he spoke "You have earned the right to become one of our generals. Yori, I am going to look forward to seeing you come through on all that you've said. And watching you grow as a Human." He stated, he was awefully amused by the boy in front of him. His attitude intrigued him, and his excitement showed, as his grip tightened on Yuriko's hand, barely containing his excitement.* - Mon Nov 23 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Too bad I don't want to eat you, I bet you taste good. - Mon Nov 23 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: . . . .Okay then.  . - Mon Nov 23 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked to Yuriko, as he took a seat on a chair, an amused grin appeared upon his face. As he spoke "You have three days, to familiarize yourself with the area around the base, and memorize the positioning of all traps which are located around the exterior. I assume training programs will be daily, and that you will keep up with your own training and studies." He watched Yori's expression once again. Before he looked at Yuriko, "Anything you'd like to ask him?"* - Mon Nov 23 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: It will be done. - Mon Nov 23 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Tell me of your abilities, Yori, Your past and your motivation. - Mon Nov 23 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: I can manipulate shadows. My past mostly consists of my father constantly yelling at me, telling me to better myself. To non stop train. My motivation, is so that I surpass not only my fathers expectations. But also yours. - Mon Nov 23 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Manipulate...Shadows? - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And surpass my expectations? - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You flatter me. - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: I try my best. - Mon Nov 23 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'm looking forward to it. - Mon Nov 23 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: The rest of your day is to yourself. - Mon Nov 23 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You start tomorrow. - Mon Nov 23 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) had probably spent all night reading through the remaining notebooks, and information on the gezo. Finally he closed his notebook and stood looking to Yuriko "How're you?"* - Mon Nov 23 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I went to retrieve his body. - Mon Nov 23 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ....? - Mon Nov 23 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The Gezo has Yosuke. - Mon Nov 23 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ...I see.. - Mon Nov 23 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I almost killed the friend who killed him. - Mon Nov 23 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But I decided to let him live. - Mon Nov 23 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her facial expression as she spoked, but he didn't touch on the topic directly after as he spoke "It looks beautiful on you." He stated, with a small smile. "Did you pick it out yourself?"* - Mon Nov 23 20:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 23 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I like it because it matches my hair and eyes. - Mon Nov 23 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And it's fancy.~ - Mon Nov 23 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled subtly, it was refreshing to see Yuriko like this after a night of boring reading. "It's quite fancy, definately suits you. M'Lady." He stated, before he spoke "Would you care to come with me, as I get some food? I'm starved." He knew she didn't eat but her company was welcomed. He gave her a look from head to toe, wondering if she had picked out shoes, or accessories that matched as well.* - Mon Nov 23 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) offered her his hand, despite her own being gloved, she seemed to have developed quite the taste, and he smiled subtly, it was hard to believe that was the same Yuriko from before. "I see...Will you follow through or was it just a threat?" He asked, looking towards her face, and more specifically into her eyes as they walked down the hallway.* - Mon Nov 23 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: look at menma] - Mon Nov 23 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: we are on a time limit] - Mon Nov 23 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her use of the words love and hate. And his gaze shifted to the table for a minute, before he spoke "I was thinking, I'd begin teaching you to read some time in the comming weeks." He stated, before ordering, a salad, with a side of grilled fish. Once his order was taken, he reached for a glass of water, raising it to his lips. He took a sip all before returning his gaze to Yuriko "Thank you."* - Mon Nov 23 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled for a bit as he spoke "I love reading to you, but I thought it was something you desired to learn." He stated, maybe he misunderstood but, he slowly moved, and aimed to wrap a single arm across her waist. "I owe you, a lot I've been learning a lot thanks to you. And I appreciate it."* - Mon Nov 23 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) (*Thirteen smiled for a bit as he spoke "I love reading to you, but I thought it was something you desired to learn." He stated, maybe he misunderstood but, he slowly moved, and aimed to wrap a single arm across her waist. "I owe you, a lot I've been learning a lot thanks to you. And I appreciate it."*)* - Mon Nov 23 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes as she scooted closer, "I know I don't have to, but I wish to. Though, after I eat, what would  you like to do?" He asked, his meal was bought to the table. Using his left hand he maneuvered the chopsticks, and began slowly eating, taking his time and taking breaks in between each swallow of food to look at Ume.* - Mon Nov 23 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he spoke "Then how about we do some training before doing a few experiments. After that'd done I intend to visit our general." He stated, as he wrapped up the last of his food. Leaning forward, he'd aim to rest his face against Yuriko's head for a moment, as he took a deep breath.* - Mon Nov 23 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was simply enjoying her softness, as he stood, he'd offer his hand to her as he spoke "There's an indoor training facility, or would you prefer outdoor?" He asked lightly, examining her  briefly as a hand moved through his hair. He didn't really mind either option, though he figured she'd prefer outside.* - Mon Nov 23 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her and perhaps for a moment his gaze narrowed "Perhaps...I should stop asking for your opinion." He stated, as he led her outside, and down to the all to familiar lake. As he spoke "I was debating what to teach you, but then I noticed the Water Collison Waves scroll. That'd be ideal probably." He stated moving to take a seat on the sand patting his lap, for her to sit, as he moved to reach for the bag that continained the scrolls. Deciding to get her started on the technique first.* - Mon Nov 23 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) unraveled the scroll as she sat down on his lap and slowly he began to read out the description for the technique known as water collision waves, which would create a large Vortex of water.  He went through the scroll relatively quick and even went to draw her another flip-book like demonstration of the technique, he had decided that he himself would work on the shadow clone technique.* - Mon Nov 23 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he relaxed upon the ground looking over Yuriko's shoulder as he began casually reading the scroll regarding the technique shadow clone jutsu, from what he was seeing it was an invaluable technique. And that definately intrigued him,  a subtle smile graced his cheeks, as he unraveled the scroll and began tracing his finger along the text to find his starting position ultimately finding the first line he took a deep breath and began to read:

"Similar to the basic Clone Technique, this technique creates copies of the user. However, these clones are corporeal instead of illusions. The user's chakra is evenly distributed among every clone, giving each clone an equal fraction of the user's overall power. " From that alone he was interested in this technique, he already had the potential to bring numerous people under the effects of his genjutsu.

He realised that when this technique is used, he'd be able to potentially put an entire village under a Genjutsu, and that excited him. He smiled to himself as he finished reading."The clones are capable of performing techniques on their own and can even bleed, but will usually disperse after hit by a strong enough force. The clones can also disperse on their own or be dispelled by the user of the technique. "

He considered that a fairly interesting technique to learn, but it was definately a high ranking one, he wondered in what direction he'd be able to take this, but he figured he'd decide when it ultimately came to battle. He'd be able to efficiently handle things around the base and that was a defnitive plus, so he was content,  he was debating how to advance himself from here, he'd need to take the time for this.* - Mon Nov 23 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked, as he noticed the large wave coming their way, and he was hit with the water. Being practically soaked in water, he slid back against the cliff, he whinched a bit as his back made contact. It definately hurt a bit, mostly because of his weak physical state, he was a bit annoyed but it didn't show. But his clothes were soaked and clingy, looking to Yuriko he didn't have to ask "Are you okay?" He knew she was,  but he wondered if she was just as wet as he was. Maybe she was water proof.* - Mon Nov 23 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at his clothes as he spoke "Peachy." Envying her ability, as he looked at her dress as he spoke "You should probably let that dry." He was thinking of a way to get back at her or punish her for soaking him. But it was definately hard to---Then he remembered, Her new emotions as he spoke "Once you take it  off, come here." He stated, as he slowly began to take off his wet clothes, he had almost forgotten she could be embarrassed now...But would she get embarrassed around him? He wasn't sure. But looking at his body, he took a seat on the ground. The sand had already started to stick to his body, and his face showed a mild irritation.* - Mon Nov 23 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: The whole reason I lost him was because of this.... - Mon Nov 23 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at Yuriko, as he smiled,  approaching her at a casual pace. He on the other hand was having no problem, at least not a noticable one. As he stopped in front of her, his hand moved to grab one of her wrists that was covering her breasts, as he spoke "Why're you covering up, Yuriko~? Don't you trust me?"He asked, a grin appearing upon his face, as his eyes found her own.* - Mon Nov 23 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched as she averted her gaze, as his tone darkened for a moment as he spoke "I don't care, what anyone has told you before. -I-, am the only one that matters." He released her wrist briefly, stepping into her as his hand moved behind her to place his palm square on the center of her back as he spoke "Because, you are -my- doll. Yuriko, no other Human should be before me in your mind." His other hand kept it's grip on her wrist, as he stared at her. * - Mon Nov 23 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) released his grasp of her wrist, as he simply uttered a single command. "Kneel." He stated, as he heard her speaking as he spoke "And you will look me in the eyes, when I address you." He stated, he did seem to be irritated, especially when she mentioned the people from the past, he didn't desire to live in the past. Because he had no past to speak of, his gaze locked onto her person. Waiting for her to comply to his demand.* - Mon Nov 23 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared down at her as he spoke "From this point, until I say otherwise. When it is just the two of us, You will address me as 'Master'." He commanded, his blonde hair hung low over his face in the front. His hazel eyes stared into the eyes, of his precious doll.  It was times like this that really got his blood boiling,  he enjoyed when she simply listened. And kneeled, it was times like this he wanted to see the world kneeling at his feet.* - Mon Nov 23 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled, as his hand found the top of her head, before moving gently from the top down to her cheek. Before falling to his side as he spoke "Good, girl." Before he spoke "Yuriko, you're going to make it up to me for getting me wet now. Aren't you?" It didn't seem like it was a question, as he motioned to his cock which hung before her face. As he spoke "Use your mouth, Suck." He commanded.* - Mon Nov 23 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared down at her, as she moved forward. Feeling her soft tongue move along his length, causing the blood to begin flowing once it received a bit of attention, and when she took his tip into her mouth and felt the vacuum she had created with her lips. He closed a single eye out of surprise, as he bit his bottom lip, within moments, he was up to his full length, which was probably on the larger side of things. He released a short gasp in pleasure, as she took him in, and her head moved back and forth into her mouth. The softness of her mouth coupled with the suction she had created with her lips and her tongue running across the underside of his length, sent waves of pleasure through his body. His hand found her head, but he didn't apply any pressure, his fingers combed through her mistmatched hair, as he watched her. A face of pure enjoyment, could be seen.* - Mon Nov 23 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) noticed her trembling and he licked his lips as he spoke "Are you scared, that someone might see us?" He toyed, feeling her basing out on him, he was quickly reaching his limit. Feeling her soft lips, touch his upper balls, as he spoke "Why don't you use your hands, to play with my balls, Yuriko.~"  He was enjoying this greatly, and she might've felt a subtly pulsing from his cock as she continued to pleasure him. He released a low moan, as his arousal was mounting by the second. * - Mon Nov 23 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) bit on his bottom lip, as he released another moan as her soft fingers began massaging his balls. The feeling was almost heavenly, coupled with the feeling of her sucking. He wasn't going to last for much longer, and as a testament to his beliefs, the throbbing in his cock had begun to pick up. As his hand rested atop of his head he took a deep breath, as he began slowly rocking his hips back and forth, egging his climax on as he stared into her eyes. "That face...It's perfect." He moaned out, as he bit on his bottom lip. Trying to hold onto this last bit before his incomming climax.* - Mon Nov 23 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ran his fingers through her hair once again, desperately resisting the urge to drive it home for the finale. The pulsing of his cock became more violent as she sped up with the help of his own pre-cum, hearing the subtle squelching sound which accompanied their act of pre-fertilzation. His cock throbbed once again, as a surge of pleasure rocked his body, and he reached his orgasm. Ropes of his semen aimed at filling her mouth, as he felt the tension building on his legs. He felt almost unstable, the moan which accompanied his orgasm was louder than the rest. And once it had been completed, his chest was heaving, and his breathing was heavier. A thin veil of sweat had begun to grace his alabastor flesh.* - Mon Nov 23 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took a deep breath, aiming to steady his neves, and once he had steadied himself enough, he took a seat on the ground. His heart was still racing, and he was still, on the harder side for the time being. His hand reached up to gently carress her cheek, as he spoke "Yuriko, sit on my lap." He didn't intend to continue on, but he was taking enjoyment of this 'control', he had, "Face me when you do." He stated, this was an emotion or a sight, he had never anticipated, he himself held mixed emotions regarding it.* - Mon Nov 23 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was a bit sensitive, after just having reached his orgasm. So when she sat, and he felt his member, pressed against her sex and her ass. He released a small gasp, as his hands moved to her hips, staring her in the eyes as he spoke "Yuriko, did you swallow?" He asked, one of his hands, trailing up to her breast, with a fairly gently grope. He stared into her eyes, he wondered, if he should continue. But he was beginning to think against it.* - Mon Nov 23 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) examined the shame ni her eyes, as his grin remained for an extra moment. He had done what he intended to for the sake of punishing her. He believed himself to be one who practiced both the carrot and the stick, so his hands raised from her hips, moving to her back, he'd pull her in closer. His hands, gently moving up and down her back, as he used one of his hands, to guide her head to his shoulder. 

"My precious Yuriko, speak with me."* - Mon Nov 23 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved to kiss her neck, as she wrapped her arms around him. As he spoke "Tell me how you feel." He stated lightly, wondering if she'd be upfront with him, he already had a pretty decent assessment. Though was curious if she herself came to terms with her emotions.* - Mon Nov 23 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) continued rubbing her back as he asked "Do you enjoy that sensation? Feeling Ashamed, Yuriko?"* - Mon Nov 23 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes as he spoke "Look at me, Yuriko." He'd state, aiming to look her in the eyes should she look towards him.* - Mon Nov 23 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I won't do it like that, again. But I do, enjoy that closeness with you. - Tue Nov 24 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Do you know why I even had a desire to that that, Yuriko? - Tue Nov 24 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It's okay that you did it like that. - Tue Nov 24 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You are my owner. - Tue Nov 24 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And...no I don't. - Tue Nov 24 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's because, when I see my precious doll, It's hard not to play with her. - Tue Nov 24 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And don't worry...Once your emotions are fully developed... - Tue Nov 24 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It'd be completely different. - Tue Nov 24 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's because I love my doll, that I do these things. - Tue Nov 24 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You love me? - Tue Nov 24 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled deeply, mischieviously, as he looked at her as he spoke "I do, love my Precious doll...-very- much." His words, were true in every way, but it wasn't the love she probably had thought of. It was a darker love, a manipulative and controlling one.* - Tue Nov 24 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled, as he moved to kiss her cheek, "I'm glad to hear you say that, Yuriko. I think it's about time, we headed back in. Though, I don't mind sitting here with you, Decisions...Decisions...Make this decision for me." He spoke, curious how she'd react to a choice given through command.* - Tue Nov 24 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated her question as he spoke "Hm...Only if you take charge next time we do this." He stated, curious as to her reaction.* - Tue Nov 24 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't get the urges like you do. - Tue Nov 24 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll tell you when. - Tue Nov 24 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You have experience. - Tue Nov 24 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I want to see what you've learned. - Tue Nov 24 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh you mean what I did with other people? But I just let them do things to me. - Tue Nov 24 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I didn't do things to them. - Tue Nov 24 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You are the first one to have me do things. - Tue Nov 24 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "Then this will be a learning experience for both of us." He looked at their clothes, that'd probably have dried since the amount of time they'd been out. "I suppose you -can- put your clothes on either way, So with that being said what's your decision?"* - Tue Nov 24 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled, as he approached her, his hand would find her butt with a light squeeze, as the same arm was offered to her to latch onto without releasing her butt. As he spoke "Then let's go Yuriko."* - Tue Nov 24 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "Experiment, time?" He asked, as he motioned for their room.  Though if she seemed to show any resistence to the idea, he'd roll with it, and of course stop.* - Tue Nov 24 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at Yuriko as he scratched his cheek "In the mood for good emotions or  bad?" He asked, sitting beside her as he called for the scientists, since they usually bought a selection anyway.* - Tue Nov 24 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head as he spoke" Give her the good ones." He stated, relaxing on the bed. But still holding her hand, this first vial was a retest of Happiness, the effects were tampered with a bit since the last testing three days ago. And it was offered to Yuriko in liquid form.* - Tue Nov 24 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) scratched his chin, as he spoke "Onto the next." He stated, the next in the line was one that would simulate love.. He was beginning to doubt these scientists, even tried with the good ones. So it was offered to Yuriko.* - Tue Nov 24 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) destroys the plants. He's most important. -omit-* - Tue Nov 24 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched her gaze shift to her plants, as he took a deep breath. "Interesting..." He muttered, looking at Yuriko, he wondered what the next emotion was. He found her reaction fairly interesting, making him wonder if it's effects were truly love. Or maybe she was a true plant lover, he wondered if he should give her another emotion to balance it out. But he was actually interested in if they could make her feel like they had done with the last time with Yosuke. It intrigued him that she felt the sensation of 'burning.'. But he held onto her hand unless she tried to release it. The next vial raised was one of energy. Though it wasn't innately a feeling or emotion, But it was intended for that energetic or hyper feeling.* - Tue Nov 24 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked as he looked at Yuriko, standing and he watched her looking around the room. And slowly he stood, following behind her as he spoke "Yuriko? What're you looking for?" He asked a bit perplexed about this behavior, he assumed something was working but he wasn't sure what it was. * - Tue Nov 24 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) eyes widened for a moment, as he held back laughter at the tone of Yuriko's voice, only amplified when she took the scientist's glassed. He was enjoying this greatly, as he walked up he moved to take a seat on the counter, watching her curiously as the scientist, frantically searched for her glasses...This was chaos, and it was oh so delightful. "Yuriko how do you feel?"* - Tue Nov 24 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved to go grab the scientist's glasses before handing them back "Dismissed." He didn't think it'd be wise to continue trying stuff with her in this state, but he laughed, "Wow." He stated, laughing as he moved to take a seat beside her as he asked "Yuriko how do you feel about fish?" He asked posing a completely random question wondering if she'd offer a completely randomn response.* - Tue Nov 24 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) extended a single finger, aimed at plucking her nose. As he spoke "Good observation, Have you ever eaten a fish before?" He asked, examining her face, wondering if there were any side-effects to these tests. Save for the sparatic emotions.* - Tue Nov 24 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) extended his arm in front of her mouth as he spoke "You said, I taste weird before, Does that mean everything else besides Human flesh has the same bad taste?" He asked, staring at her eyes he was finding this very entertaining.* - Tue Nov 24 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "There -are- things we could be doing to keep in motion." He stated, leaving that statement to be interpretted anyway she desired. He did rub his ear since she shouted. "What would you like to do?"* - Tue Nov 24 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked as she suddenly moved closer as he spoke "We could do 'fertilization activities'." He spoke, with a chuckle, he expected her to deny that even in her  current state as he spoke "We could go swimming,  training,  Or whatever you like~."* - Tue Nov 24 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated his options, as he leaned forward to plant a kiss on her lips. It was a quick peck as he spoke "Why not all three?"* - Tue Nov 24 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as he spoke "I could practice holding my breath, underwater. Or supporting someone else as I wade in the water. Though that's idealistic....Maybe we should just train normally then.." He suggested, but he wasn't in the mood for generic training. This was problematic, but he spoke "What sounds the most appealing to you?" He asked, standing up from the bed. "I -want- you to answer."* - Tue Nov 24 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then let's take a bath, Yuriko-chan. - Tue Nov 24 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes, Master. - Tue Nov 24 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) found this pretty hilarious,  as she ran into the bathroom, he figured after today. He was going to refocus on their goals, he did have a general now, and different cells he had to explore comming up.  So after this last bit of release, he'd move to the bathroom after stripping. He blinked as he saw how much bubbles were forming. And he laughed subtly, before he aimed to test the water with his hand. And if it was good, he'd slowly slide in, as he motioned for her to sit upon his lap in the water.* - Tue Nov 24 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) would adjust it, adding a bit more hot water, and he blinked as she straddled his lap he probably just loved this position. He watched her playing with the bubbles as he spoke "Do you like the bubbles, Yuriko?~" He asked, as his hands went to her back, before sliding down to reside upon her butt. As he gently rubbed it, he actually didn't feel like going further than this currently. Watching her was to entertaining. * - Tue Nov 24 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) found it quite refreshing to watch he rblow bubbles around, and act energetic like a kid. Closing his eyes as her hands rubbed up and down his arms, he spoke "I was thinking of inviting Yori to train with us tomorrow, as well as anything else we get to.  I'm curious as to how the troops have been developing."* - Tue Nov 24 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Mkay.~ - Tue Nov 24 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm. - Tue Nov 24 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Well, it was probably a waste-- - Tue Nov 24 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) approaches Yuriko, taking a seat on the cushion beside her. "Good morning."* - Tue Nov 24 20:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) scratched his cheek, "Today, with any luck." He stated with a gentle yawn, as he looked at her wondering if she was wearing the same dress she had picked out previously. But after a moment, he laid on the ground with his hands behind his head, looking towards the ceiling "Have you spoken to Yori since that night?"* - Tue Nov 24 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated her words as he spoke "I've heard he's been taking his position seriously. He's already been holding training exercises daily. He stood for a minute before he spoke "I'd like to train with you, I'm not physically gifted. But I'd like to focus on that for today, learn something new later. But currently, I'm interested in that stance that was in the scroll. We'll learn that stance. Right now."* - Tue Nov 24 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he smiled, lightly, offering her his hand he spoke "If Yori is around, I intend to invite him as well." He stated, figuring it'd be ideal for the General to learn of this as well. Just as he said that, and went to turn he spotted Yori "Walk with us." He stated lightly, aiming to head past the male.* - Tue Nov 24 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Sure. - Tue Nov 24 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked to Yuriko as he spoke "It's a stance used to capitalize on your own strength, and potential. An interesting one at that. Helps you keep your motions in check, keeping your energy up with more precise attacks." He stated, as he'd aim to lead them to the training area. "It'd be beneficial to all of us, in case we're forced into a situation where Ninjutsu isn't a viable option."* - Tue Nov 24 20:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Ninjutsu is always an option. - Tue Nov 24 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Although, Yuriko, if you don't wish to lean this I can start you on another technique. - Tue Nov 24 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: learn* - Tue Nov 24 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No, I will learn it. - Tue Nov 24 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked to Yori and then back to Yuriko, as he slowly reached into a small bag and withdrew a scroll that he began the process of unraveling slowly as his eyes scanned the paper in an instant.  Before tossing it to Yori, as he spoke "I had the scientists, cook up a small thing for you." He stated, as one of the woman walked forward, carrying a small bag which she offered to Yuriko which held about ten small, flesh colored balls. Which he spoke "For when you get hungry and there isn't a food source prepared---Mostly for when traveling." He stated, although these were fresh. Very Fresh. They probably all wouldn't be.

But he looked to Yori, "Study up." He stated in a light tone, as the scroll was transfered to Yori. "Hato no tsuyo-sa. Is the name of this stance."* - Tue Nov 24 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ... - Tue Nov 24 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's a treat. - Tue Nov 24 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Though I didn't know that. - Tue Nov 24 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Is it human? - Tue Nov 24 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It is. - Tue Nov 24 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Like real human, or petri dish human? - Tue Nov 24 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why do they look like marbles? - Tue Nov 24 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It may be 'grown', And as for that. Maybe to imitate candy? - Tue Nov 24 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...okay. - Tue Nov 24 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) sighed briefly, as he slowly entered the stance. Taking a deep breath, his stance was firm. The spacing of his feet were even, as his fist were balled. He took a deep breath and focused  forward. He didn't know why Yuriko seemed to anxious today, maybe a side effect of the experiments he wasn't exactly sure. But he took a deep breath and sighed, as he cracked his knuckles, as he slowly began to move his form. 

His body shifted slightly, as his left foot was immediately raised upwards. Pointing at an angle towards the sky, before it was bent and lowered back down. He filled his lungs with air, as his left fist was shot forward, followed by his right. Dropping down almost effortlessly, his right leg was extended, in a partial sweeping fashion before he stood.  His hair swayed gently with each movement.

His gaze focused on an imaginary target, as the speed of his attacks began to speed up, and he began chaining punches and kicks together to create a combo, he was making startling process on his learning curve, this was fairly interesting to him, he wondered who had invented this stance, it caused his body to make up for it's lack of strength partially, it was...intriguing. He was enjoying this.

He wasn't paying attention to Yori simply because he believed in his potential to learn something like this even if it took a while to do so. He yawned, this was pretty easy, and he was content with his progress, so with a gentle sigh, he relaxed his body and dropped from his stance, returning to Yuriko's side, he'd contemplate what he should do, but he sent the scientists to begin preparing tranquilizers for the patients that may be contained behind those doors.* - Tue Nov 24 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: she killed you? - Tue Nov 24 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) approaches, Yuriko. "Hello there." He stated just sitting beside her.* - Tue Nov 24 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yuriko. - Tue Nov 24 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'd like to handle the money this base has. - Tue Nov 24 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Tue Nov 24 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'd like to make several investments is all. - Tue Nov 24 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: See if I can cut costs where necessary. - Tue Nov 24 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: You're questioning me, Yuriko? - Tue Nov 24 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Thank you, Yuriko. I appreciate it, won't you show me your beautiful smile? - Tue Nov 24 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) raised a hand to her cheek, as he moved across it with a gentle motion. "Thank you very much." He stated, as he leaned to give her a kiss on the forehead.* - Tue Nov 24 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: You may relax. - Tue Nov 24 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yori. - Tue Nov 24 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Check with the Science department if those Tranquilizers are ready. - Tue Nov 24 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You'll be comming with us. - Tue Nov 24 23:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You can still roll my way fam - Wed Nov 25 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he moved to retrieve the tranquilzers once they were offered to him as he spoke "I looked at a technique by the name of, Shadow Imitation, I'm assuming it was one of your family's techniques. Your help will be vaulable here."  He stated lightly, he was just waiting on the notification, that it was prepared and the section of the building was closed off in case of an escape.* - Wed Nov 25 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Yes, I am. - Wed Nov 25 00:08:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he spoke "I see, Do you believe he has the potential to be a General?" He asked, looking towards Yori, he hadn't met the individual himself. But he was curious as to what Yori thought of him.* - Wed Nov 25 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: He could be fit for the General position aswell, do you intend on assigning two positions? - Wed Nov 25 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Not exactly the same position. - Wed Nov 25 01:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at Hokori and then to Yuriko, and Yori as he scratched his cheek he slowly spoke "I suppose this will be ideal, I plan to go open one of the cells that contain an experiment today. I'm curious as to what will be within. But I'll need you present just in case."* - Wed Nov 25 01:41:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: He's the first person to tell me no, Yuriko. - Wed Nov 25 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: It's intriguing. - Wed Nov 25 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He seems confident, maybe I shouldn't eat him yet. - Wed Nov 25 02:17:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Wow he makes things really fast. - Wed Nov 25 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared at the man as he spoke "You don't wish to train, That's fine. But you are currently disobeying your commanding officer. That....Is in fact unacceptable, You don't wish to take orders? Then become a General, or rather -try- to. I do not care much for what you do in your free time, But if." Motions to Yori, "Your current commanding officer decides, that you're to train for a while. You will follow, unless you supply a valid reason otherwise. Or as such...Punishment will be dealt accordingly."* - Wed Nov 25 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, maybe he had Hokori pegged wrong from the beginning? He laughed subtly, in his own mis-analysis, standing his hand would've found the top of Yuriko's head, as he stared at the male. As he spoke "So be it." He stated, he was enjoying this attitude, so different from the others. It was enjoyable, an exciting change of pace, as he spoke "I will not, punish you." He stated, as he looked down to Yuriko as he spoke "And you...will not become her meal, I thank you. For making this day....a lot more enjoyable." He stated, as he looked to Yori then to Hokori "May I get your name?"* - Wed Nov 25 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared at the man with his unblinking cold and analytical gaze. As he then spoke "It's a pleasure, My name....Is Thirteen." He stated, before he shifted his gaze to Yori, as he spoke, "I suppose, You can hold onto these for the time being." He stated handing the tranquilzers to the male "It doesn't seem as if We'll be going there today." Before he closed his eyes for a moment "Hokori, I'd like for you to work alongside Yori, making plans to tighten security around the island. It'd be most beneficial to Yuriko's health, and would prevent future attacks." He paused taking out two scrolls, he immediately proceeded to copy the writing from one of the scrolls onto another.And tossed the copied scroll towards Yori as well. 

"I'd like for Two Hundred and Fifty Guards to be taught that technique, It's the Barrier Canopy Method, A wide-range Sensory Technique. These guards are to be stationed at the edge of the islands, once they have a grasp of the technique. He stated lightly.* - Wed Nov 25 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You two are free to do as you please, for the rest of the day. - Wed Nov 25 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Alright. - Wed Nov 25 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Hm, Yuriko. - Wed Nov 25 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: What types of plants, would you like to plant? - Wed Nov 25 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes? - Wed Nov 25 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Flowers. - Wed Nov 25 03:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Is that your favorite type of plants now? - Wed Nov 25 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Or do you just enjoy saying it? - Wed Nov 25 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Both? - Wed Nov 25 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Succulenttttttttttttttttttt. - Wed Nov 25 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: This.. is going to get annoying.. - Wed Nov 25 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Quick.. - Wed Nov 25 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: When do I get to eat real people instead of these ...petri dish things. - Wed Nov 25 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Whenever you decide. - Wed Nov 25 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't need you to act that way, I don't care about respect. I can't care, you know that right? You heard what I am like? I won't need respect until I get more emotions. - Wed Nov 25 11:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It's pointless. - Wed Nov 25 11:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I won't sit on a shelf, he won't put me there. - Wed Nov 25 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I'll eat him if he puts me on a shelf. - Wed Nov 25 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Even if he doesn't taste good. - Wed Nov 25 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I'll eat anyone who tries to put me on a shelf. - Wed Nov 25 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: No shelves! - Wed Nov 25 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: No other dolls! - Wed Nov 25 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: No dolls, no dolls, no dolls. - Wed Nov 25 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Little boxes all in a row... - Wed Nov 25 12:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Dollies dusty...dust--dusty..dust dolls dusty. - Wed Nov 25 12:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked to Yuriko and waved, before slowly approaching her, he'd move to sit beside her. "Hey, Beautiful. How was your morning?" He yawned subtly having just awakened.* - Wed Nov 25 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her facial expression, followed by a brief assessment of her clothing he posed the question "Where are your shoes?" That peaked his interest, momentaily. But he seemed to be carrying a bag, which he set down in front of her. * - Wed Nov 25 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he spoke "I see, I suppose you won't be needing them right now."If she opened the bag, held within was a pair of Cargo shorts, with brown boots, and a white T-Shirt, along with quite a few varities of seeds. "Go ahead and open it."* - Wed Nov 25 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked but he didn't say anything for a moment, and relaxed against the wall. His gaze fell to her as he took a moment before speaking "I was thinking we could plant that garden of yours today, Would you like that?" He asked, looking towards the piles of clothing. Before too the seeds.* - Wed Nov 25 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, as he moved to wrap his arm gently around her shoulders. As took a deep breath, before he spoke "No. Yuriko, I have no need, nor desire. You're the only one I need, and desire in my existence. I cherish you, Yuriko."* - Wed Nov 25 18:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "That's for you to decide, Both if I'm a good liar, and if I'm telling you the truth. I said before, I loved you, and every part of you." His gaze met her own, as he spoke "But they say...You can look a human in the eyes to tell if they're lying....Look into my eyes, with your own beautiful ones. And tell me if there's even a hint of dishonesty, as I repeat the words I've told you before." He stated, his gaze focusing on her.* - Wed Nov 25 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) as she stared into his eyes, he wasn't lying. He truly did love her, this was his opinion of love. It showed in his eyes, a relaxed, caring, loving, and passionate gaze. Stared back into her own, what he said was true about loving her. No matter how dark it was, it was in fact true.* - Wed Nov 25 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes briefly, as he heard her next question as he spoke "It's because...I wish to see you shine brighter, than you've ever shined before, and a diamond shines brightest after first being dirtied." He stated, in a calm tone, as he looked at her "I never wished to hurt you, nor to have you think less of me." As his hand, rested on her shoulder, he leaned in aiming to rest his head upon hers, while looking up to her. "I'm flawed, Yuriko. Sometimes, my own imperfections get the best of me."* - Wed Nov 25 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: What if.... I don't shine for you.... will you put me back into the room and lock me up? - Wed Nov 25 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Never. - Wed Nov 25 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Will I ever, imprison you. - Wed Nov 25 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And you're already shining for me, Yuriko. - Wed Nov 25 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Wed Nov 25 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why do you enjoy punishing me - Wed Nov 25 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: *? - Wed Nov 25 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: As much, as I hated doing that mentally, forcing you like that. Phyiscally, it wasn't the same,  As it brings me pleasure. But....I believe, it'd feel greater. If we wanted it to occur, in that moment. Not of punishment, but if feeling alone. - Wed Nov 25 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Huh? - Wed Nov 25 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But you liked holding me down. - Wed Nov 25 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And you smiled at making me feel ashamed. - Wed Nov 25 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I enjoyed it...Feeling in control. - Wed Nov 25 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But that gaze in your eyes, It didn't feel 'complete'. - Wed Nov 25 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...You could tell that I didn't like it? - Wed Nov 25 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I mean... not 'didn't like it'... - Wed Nov 25 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But.... just. - Wed Nov 25 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You weren't. - Wed Nov 25 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The shame feels... - Wed Nov 25 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Not good. - Wed Nov 25 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'm sorry, Yuriko, I would....like to make it up. - Wed Nov 25 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Some day. - Wed Nov 25 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: When you're ready. - Wed Nov 25 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) removed his arm from around Yuriko, he offered a gentle smile towards her, almost out of character. As he spoke "Yuriko, I love you. I understand the actions I've done, had made it hard to see that, But they're apart of me. But for you, I will change.I will become the Owner, you need and desire. So, I ask...Place your faith in me." He stood, moving before her, his hand was offered to her. "Just take my hand." He did care for her, enough to change the way he presented himself, to maintain his interests. Which lay in her, his emotions were learned, not something aquired over time. Therefore it was easier for him to manipulate them to suit his needs. * - Wed Nov 25 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he thought to himself "Maybe I misread the situation?" He thought, as he stood, "Let's go, Yuriko." He stated, offering her his hand out of habit.* - Wed Nov 25 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took her hand in his own, and for a moment, his gaze showed irritation of the uttermost degree. But that was quickly erased, as he pulled her along, there had been a room that had been set up for them. It was filled with fetilizer, and any tools that would be needed for gardening. As he led her in, he closed the door, as he spoke "Hm...You don't need to wear those clothes, not in here. It's just the two of us." He stated lightly, as he looked at the ground, "I made sure to purchase, numerous succulents, Yuriko."* - Wed Nov 25 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, as he spoke "Your nudity has never been a problem before when it's just the two of us, has it?" He asked, he wondered why there had been such drastic changes in her attitude as of late, it irritated him...Was she talking to someone? Planning to betray him? Maybe the experiments had more effects than he thought? Maybe she was testing him, he wasn't all to sure. As he spoke "I didn't think we'd be alone at first, But since we are the situation has changed."* - Wed Nov 25 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) gaze shifted from her as she stripped, crouching down, his hand touched the soil, as he spoke "There are a wide variety of seeds in the bag, Though is there a way you'd like to have them planted? I figured this would be a good room for you to hang out in if you're ever bored." He stated lightly, as his gaze shifted over to her, as he waited for her reply.* - Wed Nov 25 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at the soil, for a moment, before he moved to grab the bag. Grabbing one of the 'succulent' seed packages. He tore it open, releasing all the seeds into his palm as he spoke "It's fairly simple." He stated, as he placed his finger against the soil, and dug a hole, straight down, about an two or so inches. Before he dropped the seed in, and brushed dirt over it. Covering it, reaching for the watering can, he'd pour a bit of water over it. "That's basically it, it'll take a while for them to grow, but We'll have to tend to them daily. Watering them, watching them grow, and make sure nothing unsavory grows."* - Wed Nov 25 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled, as he had been going probably at a slower pace, and taking care not to step on her plants. He'd crouch beside her, looking at her nude form as it was covered, with dirt. His hand found her back as he spoke "Now we wait, and come to see what fruit our hard work bears." He stated, with a subtle smile, it was actually enjoyable at times, to do such a thing with her "I'm sure they'll grow to be strong, and healthy plants." He paused "Especially, if you visit them daily and speak with them." He stated, looking down towards the soil.* - Wed Nov 25 19:49:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Like I said, he's bringing it IC that the fact that an Uchiha was grieving, was them trying to Milk Sharingan, and continued to troll in say chat when I told him to stop. - Thu Nov 26 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at Yuriko, as he reclined against the wall of the garden, having decided to read a book had they remained in here for this long.* - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked up from his book and down towards the soil, he stared hard at the ground as he spoke "Are they? That's great." He stated with slight enthusisasm. A small smile graced his lips, as he looked towards her, though honestly. He was envious of her inability to feel heat or cold, which made him pose the question could she be burned or suffer from frostbite? He wasn't sure, though he definately didn't wish to find out.* - Thu Nov 26 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated it, as he spoke "Took a guard with you? I'd be more than willing to go with you outside whenever you wish, But if you're going out. I suppose Yori will be willing to accompany you." He stated, as he moved to drape his arm across her shoulders, leaning into her.* - Thu Nov 26 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes as he spoke "It sounds like you have someone in mind?" He asked, resting his head on her shoulder after she shrugged.* - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) kept his eyes closed, listening to her as she spoke "I don't know much, if anything about Hokori, save for the fact he challenges authority. And what did you talk about?" He asked curiously, "Thinks different?" He asked himself mentally, but didn't say anything else. He wasn't sure if he could trust Hokori, nor Yori he put Yori in a position of power as a test. But Hokori? He wasn't sure he could do the same.* - Thu Nov 26 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) listened to her words as he spoke "And he believes he's something different?" He asked, resting against her soft skin. Feeling the texture against his cheek, he relished in the feeling. It was comforting, (Is she like room temperature, or Cold? I've been meaning to ask) he could rest against her all day, and listen to the sound of her voice. Look at her hair, and into her eyes, he was proud to have a doll which was as perfect as he believed possible with her imperfections. It made him feel powerful...In control.* - Thu Nov 26 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes, as he felt the gentle comforting warmth, which radiated from her flesh. "I see, I trust you, to make the right decisions. It's him I don't neccessarily trust, I guess it's fine. But I'm going to have another guard shadow you for your safety." He stated lightly, he hadn't been given ample reason to doubt Hokori besides his attitude. But he wouldn't judge a book by it's cover.* - Thu Nov 26 02:25:55 2015

He asked, without opening his eyes, his nostrils inhaled the subtle sent of the freshly place soil, which caused it to wiggle. He didn't really enjoy the scent much.* - Thu Nov 26 02:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) as he sat behind her, his right hand moved to rest on her upper thigh, as his left trailed up her body, across her breast, and to her neck. Where he aimed to hold, leaning forward. He'd aim to bite down on her collarbone from behind, a gentle bite. As he spoke "That look in your eyes....Was intoxicating, Yuriko."* - Thu Nov 26 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, as his bite, turned into a lick, going up the side of her neck. Before a subtle kiss was placed on her neck. "That's....What makes me love you so, You're the perfect doll...Unbreakable...No matter what I do...It's...exciting!" He declared, as his hand drifted aiming to find the space between her legs, while his other hand, aimed to tilt her head off to the side while pulling her closer to lean into him.  "You're beautiful...Your expressions, Your fear....Your doubt...All those emotions you feel for me...-excite- me. Yuriko."* - Thu Nov 26 07:25:26 2015

He stated, as his fingers brushed against her sex, he knew she couldn't feel it. But two fingers, rubbed against her outer lips, feeling the texture of them, their form. The softness,  "You are mine, Yuriko." Her trembling made him feel even more so in control, his heart raced, and he felt himself getting aroused beneath her.* - Thu Nov 26 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt her trying to move his hand, and went with the action, he was curious to see where she went with this. But suddenly, his other hand would, attempt to prod at her entrance between he legs. Before suddenly aiming to push in one of his fingers, he wondered if in her frightened state, she'd be taken off guard. As he spoke "Yuriko. Take my shirt off for me." He stated, his tone was commanding, but also had a sense of pleasure.* - Thu Nov 26 07:43:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) hands had moved together beneath the table, as he began subtly weaving his handseals. One, two, three, four, Five. And he was done,  His chakra suddenly flared outwards. Around the entirety of the room, capturing everyone and everything within a spherical manner around his person to experience this, Yori, Yuriko, And Hokori included. They'd all suddenly feel chains, and cuffs shackling themselves to the nearest surface. The guards would fall as well, as the boy simply stated:

"I'm....tired of this game we're playing." He muttered, standing from the desk, he might've been able to produce this effect without going noticed, since his hands were beneath the table. 

"I needed, an excuse to vent." He stated, patiently, he stood from where he sat. And began to walk around the table, the steady tapping of his fingers against the table's wooden surface.* - Thu Nov 26 21:32:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) slowly approached Hokori, his hand slid along the edge table as he approached the male. Standing straight up, As his gaze shifted to Yuriko "Silence." He spoke, as his hands raised to chest level. He'd make another seal,  his chakra would surge outwards into Hokori's body, And excructiating pain could've been felt. As the interrogation genjutsu was casted---A double layered Genjutsu.  He opened his mouth, and his gaze was calm, analytical...Assessing the man before him as he spoke:

"Before I decide, If I kill you. You're going to answer some questions, What were your intentions, Truthfully, Hokori of the Keibetsu 'clan'."* - Thu Nov 26 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, as he spoke "That's adorable." As his gaze shifted to Yuriko, as he spoke "He's right.....You aren't a doll, No....You're something much different. You're my pet Yuriko, I mistook you for something you weren't. Befriending....Such...Trash." He muttered as a spike suddenly materialized in front of Hokori's left hand, aiming to pierce through the palm and pin it to the wall. The pain would very much be felt, and another shot towards his left leg repeating the process.

"As such...I'm revoking your right, to have rights. Your body, Is mine, your soul is mine, And so is that which composes them both. Until I choose to destroy them both." He stated briefly, before shifting his gaze back to Hokori.

"You, were the one that made my Doll. Fall from greatness. I'm going to break you....Until your mind becomes so fragile, the subtle summer breeze will cause it to tumble like the tower of Bable."* - Thu Nov 26 22:06:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) a sinister grin appeared on his face, as a low chuckle began to rise from his core. Changing into full blown laughter at the squabbling of Hokori, as he simply stated. "I am not human, I'm sick of imitating a dying breed." He stated as he made a single seal, and his chakra flared. The full brunt attack of his chakra was aimed at Hokori's mind, the things he feared would begin to materialize around the room in High Definition. 

"Your mission, was to serve Yuriko, protect her? How does it feel knowing you've failed, Hokori?"

The Genjutsu's effect was so monstrous, it would practically begin chipping away at Hokori's mental state, aimed at breaking him, in the most slow and excruciating way possible. As a choker would've appeared around Yuriko's throat.

"Watch what happens, to those who defy me. Watch him scream Yuriko."

He stated, as the choker would aim at keeping her head held up and towards Hokori. He didn't kill him, he didn't want to not yet, he'd allow this to continue. For as long as neccessary.* - Thu Nov 26 22:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at him as he spoke that he wasn't a real man, That he  was just a number. He smiled as he spoke "Finally, you understand--Or maybe It is I who understands?" He stated as he approached one of the guards, and he reached for their Katana, holding it in his hand. He slowly stepped back over to Hokori holding the blade forward it was extended. When he was on the brink of insanity, or total mental collapse the tip of his blade was placed over his heart, "At the end of the day,  You helped me more than I could ever have helped you. I was lost, playing this game of compassion. Trying to be human."

He took a deep breath, as his eyes stared at his chest, almost envisioning where his heart was. Before his palm found the hilt of the Katana, and he pushed forward, aiming to drive the blade through the man's chest whilst he could still acknowledge the pain.

"You Hokori, of the Keibetsu family. Have finally released me from my final shackle. I am not human."

He paused, as the blade probably would've hit the cement behind him as he spoke:

"I am Thirteen."* - Thu Nov 26 22:41:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looks toward Yuriko, as he slowly began to approach her, his hand finding her cheek as it rested their he'd aim to look her in the eyes. As he spoke "This, I know it hurts, Yuriko. But this is the consequence, when you betray me, and let people like that corrupt your thoughts. This is the price you will pay." He stated, releasing the remaining two from the Genjutsu along with the guards, as he would've stared down towards Ume, "You have no will, Your will is my will Yuriko."* - Thu Nov 26 22:48:44 2015
