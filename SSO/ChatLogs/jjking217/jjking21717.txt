<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: In which case, Whoever calls the penalty has to pay the other person, One Hundred Thousand, And the penalty will include a 'dare'. - Thu Oct 29 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Meaning you can both lose money, or gain money. - Thu Oct 29 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Hmm..That sounds like fun. - Thu Oct 29 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Well then, Shall we play a test round? - Thu Oct 29 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Mhm. Sounds like fun. - Thu Oct 29 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then name Six body parts, For the sake of the game, We'll consider hand and 'arm' to be the same thing. - Thu Oct 29 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll name six Actions based on your six body parts. - Thu Oct 29 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then we'll begin. - Thu Oct 29 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) considered her choices as he simply stated "Rub, Pinch, lick, poke, pluck, or Kiss." He followed up by unsealing two die, which he passed over to her.* - Thu Oct 29 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: So I just have to roll the die, and then? - Thu Oct 29 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: At the same token, for the sake of variation, when I say rub, It can be with your cheek, arm, Foot, whatever you please. And you roll one die, Which will correspond to the body parts you listed. - Thu Oct 29 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then you roll again for the Action. - Thu Oct 29 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And that'd be the action you have to do to me. - Thu Oct 29 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If you choose to back out, You'll pay the penalty and take a dare. - Thu Oct 29 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: So I have to....Rub your head? - Thu Oct 29 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So rub my head. - Thu Oct 29 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah. - Thu Oct 29 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) laughed a bit as she rubbed his head, but he figured it'd be easier if he sat beside her, It'd probably be a pain if one of them had to keep getting up. After she completed the action, he'd reach for his dice, before rolling twice.* - Thu Oct 29 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: uno momento - Thu Oct 29 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Kiss your arm. - Thu Oct 29 19:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would look at her extended arm, as he lowered his gaze, before he slowly aimed to plant a kiss on her forearm, before offering her the dice.* - Thu Oct 29 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Kiss yer leg. - Thu Oct 29 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Don't worry, After Five turns, The options are changed, and it gets harder. - Thu Oct 29 19:34:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: easy* - Thu Oct 29 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as his pants leg was pulled up, before he felt Saeza's lips upon his flesh, moving up his leg, before reaching the inside of his thigh. For the most part, he seemed awefully calm, but when she planted the final kiss, he felt a faint blush overtake his cheeks, not to say he didn't find the entire thing appealing. As he coughed nervously before reaching for the dice, had she given them he'd roll the dice forward, without commenting on it.* - Thu Oct 29 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Kiss your head... - Thu Oct 29 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) leans forward, his faint blush was very obvious. As his hands found her shoulders, he'd lean in before attempting to plant a small kiss upon her forehead, before pulling away, he'd scratch his cheek nervously, before placing the dice down.* - Thu Oct 29 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) eyes widened at this sudden revelation, as he recoiled almost commically. His finger tips found his lips, "I-I'm sorry." He stated, ushering the dice to her, he couldn't believe he had just kissed her on the lips, he'd have to be...More careful the rest of the game, but his blush was a tad bit more pronounced giving away just how flustered he was.* - Thu Oct 29 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Y-Yeah. - Thu Oct 29 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) got nervous at her use of the word 'fun' as he spoke "Pick s-six...Body parts, they can b-be recylced if you'd like..." He stated lightly nodding his head as he came up with six more actions.* - Thu Oct 29 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Can we set one body part to multiple slots? - Thu Oct 29 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: No more than two slots. - Thu Oct 29 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Hmm.... - Thu Oct 29 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And only for one body part. - Thu Oct 29 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as he noticed her plan to get him to call for a penalty...He realised this would be problematic but he simply stated:

"Rub, massage, Lick, Pinch, grope, kiss....But in the case one of these aren't pickable...Because you can't grope a toe or something, you will roll between the two of the other doable options picked by the other person...Sound good?"* - Thu Oct 29 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Aye. - Thu Oct 29 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I'll go first. - Thu Oct 29 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Wait... - Thu Oct 29 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Rub and Massage are the same thing...Could I suggest a replacement for Rub? - Thu Oct 29 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Sure...If I can choose a replacement for face. - Thu Oct 29 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Good. I choose Suck. - Thu Oct 29 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --- - Thu Oct 29 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I choose butt... - Thu Oct 29 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Let's play.. - Thu Oct 29 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: What's the chances of her getting that Roll? One Out of Thirty Six? - Thu Oct 29 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: W-What... - Thu Oct 29 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as  his shirt was ripped open, before she began sucking upon his chest in various places, it was definately an odd sesnsation. As his face lit up like a christmas light, and honestly, he wasn't expecting her to suck upon his nipple, which was an even odder sensation. Only to have her pinch his other one, it seemed like it wasn't his sweet spot. But it definately left him flustered, it was....Embarrassing to say the least.  He reached for the dice, deciding he needed a shower after this.* - Thu Oct 29 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) with a few nevous coughs, he rolled the dice.* - Thu Oct 29 20:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Inner-thigh...Grope.. - Thu Oct 29 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) swallowed hard, as he looked towards what she was actually wearing, which was assumed to be a dress at this point. And he saw, her panties, and his gaze was averted slightly, as he spoke "O-On second thought.....I-I think I'm just going to....Take the penalty.." He stated with a nod of his head "I have to....Rethink some things." He stated nodding his head, his embarrassment very much visible as the dice were placed on the table, along with one hundred Grand.* - Thu Oct 29 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Y-Yeah. - Thu Oct 29 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I forgot to add this but. - Thu Oct 29 20:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: That is a single request. I said -a- scroll. - Thu Oct 29 20:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That single scroll holds multiple things. - Thu Oct 29 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You can ask for a single techniquuuuuuuu a time. - Thu Oct 29 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Technique* - Thu Oct 29 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Or an article of clothing...Etcetera. - Thu Oct 29 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I know. Sell me all of your jutsu in scroll form. It'll only be a single transaction, well not all of them... - Thu Oct 29 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Simply..A couple I don't know. - Thu Oct 29 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: *nods her head* - Thu Oct 29 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Only one at a time. - Thu Oct 29 20:11:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: ...Very well. - Thu Oct 29 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Why not. - Thu Oct 29 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Your turn. - Thu Oct 29 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: To roll - Thu Oct 29 20:12:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Mhm.. - Thu Oct 29 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) thinks: He actually took the dare. Interesting. - Thu Oct 29 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --- - Thu Oct 29 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Luckily you didn't ask me to take off my pants...Or that'd hurt a lot more.. - Thu Oct 29 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ---Did I say that aloud? - Thu Oct 29 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her hand grasp him through his pants, causing him to gasp out in pain as he unconciously, fell forward towards Saeza. Luckily he had pants on, and had been punched in the nuts often by girls and built up some sort of tolerance, didn't mean it didn't hurt a lot.* - Thu Oct 29 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) continued to stay leaned forward as he spoke "F-Fine, F-Fine...L-Let's continue. .L-Let go...T-That r-really hurts." He gasped out in pain.* - Thu Oct 29 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as she lets go he spends a moment, holding his crotch as the pain was relieved, he looked up to her as he spoke "S-Suna...But don't tell anyone." He stated managing to sit up after a moment and rolling.* - Thu Oct 29 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Rub your Toes or by extension foot or leg..? - Thu Oct 29 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Nuhuhuh... - Thu Oct 29 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Remember... - Thu Oct 29 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: We swapped rub for suck... - Thu Oct 29 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) silently cursed wondering why he agreed to that switch, and slowly he looked towards her foot as he extended his hands to slowly raise it. Before he looked at her individual toes, he swallowed hard, before raising her big-toe to his lips, slowly guiding it into his mouth luckily it was clean. But he began slowly sucking, his gaze shifted away out of embarrassment. Before after a moment, he transitioned to the next...And the next, before he finished the set. And avoided eye contact as he set her foot back down, offering her the dice.* - Thu Oct 29 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ---Boredom mostly....Entertainment is a close second. - Thu Oct 29 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her hand moved down his body, before heading to his inner though, as he felt her hand. He slowly gasped as she began working the flesh, his blush became more obvious. As a slight reaction could be seen from his crotch as her hand inched closer to his crotch. He looked at her as he spoke "O-One more...F-Full round...And we'll c-call it a day." He said jerking his leg away after a moment. Looking away.* - Thu Oct 29 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) waves his hand "If that's five penalities....Then...Sure." He stated reaching for the money, as he spoke "First penalty.....I dare you....To sit on my lap." He stated nodding his head, definately embarrassed, he didn't think she'd do it. He was still thinking of her as a normal girl, which she obviously wasn't.* - Thu Oct 29 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as she actually slid onto his lap, he silently cursed as he spoke "Second dare....I want you to roll the dice for three turns worth and perform the actions." He stated nodding his head.* - Thu Oct 29 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: One action at a time please. - Thu Oct 29 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Fine. - Thu Oct 29 20:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked away, he was extremely flustered, but he didn't say. No he scratched his cheek, not looking towards her. It was definately due to his embarrassment and 'flustered' ness to not responding...But he didn't respond, but he definately had a bulge on his pants.* - Thu Oct 29 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) shook his head as she spoke, and immediately he jumped backwards as his pants were pulled down. "N-Nevermind....I'm changing my dare. To...Never speak about this again."* - Thu Oct 29 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Whenever I get the chance. - Thu Oct 29 20:47:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Well then... - Thu Oct 29 20:51:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) scratched his chin as he simply spoke "A subordinate of sorts, I've spotted her in quite a few other villages." He stated, as he looked at her and he realised why she suddenly grabbed his hand.  He stared forward though.* - Thu Oct 29 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Thu Oct 29 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Thu Oct 29 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Well, I'd like to tell you form the start. - Thu Oct 29 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Thu Oct 29 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: She was talking to Kilm and Trilliam about buying techniques and etcetera. - Thu Oct 29 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So I approached her saying "I have a way for you to buy techniques -and- make money." - Thu Oct 29 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) shrugs he had absolutely no clue what she was talking about and didn't pick up on social cues, at all.* - Thu Oct 29 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Thu Oct 29 21:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) still had absolutely no clue what she was talking about as he simply spoke "Stop talking crap, and just spit it out." He stated, crossing his legs,  in a business like fashion. He did have a mild irritation in his voice, he felt like he knew what Saeza was up to, and didn't seem to enjoy it.* - Thu Oct 29 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sat still as he watched the situation unfold, he didn't say anything, but his analysis had been...Spot on to say the least. He was able to confirm several beliefs, but he felt like this was being made out to be worse than it initially was. He stood up, comming to the conclusion, life was...unusually shitty this fine day. But he had come to accept thsi fact, whenever he had something good. Something happened, and aimed to ruin it, but that was fine.

He was irritated byond all belief, but even in his irritation, there was a mild calmness. The Gezo Sergeant, didn't say anything once again, he was furious...One of those calm rages. As he stared forward, he felt a...Tightness in his gut, as he made a single seal, and his chakra flared around the entiriety of the house. It was fairly obvious.

There would be Guards comming to this position.* - Thu Oct 29 21:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looks at her as he stood, he knew there was a big possibility she'd kill him. But honestly, he felt like he didn't do anything. But he at least wanted her to understand his own side of the story, as he stood before her he simply stated "I'll finish where I left off. I wanted to understand, why she was migrating from village to village, so I invited her to play a game in order to make some money. As we played, I purposefully kept taking faults,  and she called a Dare which was to kill the Mizukage. She was odd, I never believed Susumu raped her, Honestly she seemed like 'that' kind of person." He admitted, he looked at her as he spoke "She made the game weirder, so I kept taking faults. repeatedly, and ultimately she got bored and surrendered. The Dares I issued were as followed "Don't talk about this game, You will work for me, And my word will be law." Ultimately this happened, But I was able to confirm two of my beliefs. But honestly, I will submit to any Interrogation Technique you wish to try on me.  I don't think you were wrong, And I would've killed her myself. But either way, I'm going to apologize for not saying anything further...I don't know how she found this house...Or anything of the sorts, her personality was weird."* - Thu Oct 29 21:58:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You're right. - Thu Oct 29 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But there's one thing...I've been delaying. - Thu Oct 29 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: For a while now. - Thu Oct 29 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: One truth I've been trying to run away from. - Thu Oct 29 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Thu Oct 29 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would step closer to Katsune, attempting to grasp both her hands gently in his own as he looked down to her as he spoke "For the longest time, I've been runnning away. From the truth behind my escapades, I blamed the world, I found enemies, They were my reason for doing this...I wanted... To gain the upper hand, I've never been strong. I'm not the smartest guy out there, so I relied on my hate, Held grudges, Did what I could to survive."

He paused looking at her once again as he spoke "I realised, over these last two weeks, That I....I'm my biggest enemy. It is myself, That I hate, the part of my soul I don't allow anyone to see. It's a little child, throwing a temper tantrum whenever he doesn't get his way." He looked towards the ceiling, before out towards the hole which was now gracing their walls. As he stared at the floor.

"This 'spy thing', was a way for me to hide who I am beneath many different faces. It was the mask I wore, to make me stand out---Ironic, since my goal was to stay out of the sight of others.." He laughed lightly, as he spoke, "I hate pitying myself, And I know you hate listening to it, The person I've been hating all this time...The person I've sought ot get rid of...And bury six feet under. The person I blamed for my parent's death, Was -me-." 

He shifted his gaze to the side as he spoke "That's foolish though isn't it? Index, is the person I hate the most in this world. But, I will forgive him...Because, To end this...Game of spies....Index must die. Only then, Will I be able to truly free myself from my past, and focus solely on the path which stands before me."

As he looked at Katsune, As he spoke "I must die, to complete my end of the promise I made to you Katsune. I must shed my name, and my past. Wipe away, whatever the man known as Index, was or ever would be." He simply stated before he looked at Katsune as he simply stated:

"But I forgive myself, Because in the wake of all my Mistakes, There was one thing...I wouldn't call a mistake. That's meeting you, Kat. You gave me something, that I can never regret. And the time I spent with you is something, I'll never forget."* - Thu Oct 29 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: That sounded Poetic. - Thu Oct 29 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I tottally said that awesomely. - Thu Oct 29 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) scratched his cheek, as he sat on the couch, he simply stated "That was the truth, I realised how stupid it sounded...Though, I can use your help plotting my new identity. As I said...I will die, Doesn't mean...I want 'us' to as well." He stated, he didn't feel like he had to include the last part but it was on his mind, he felt like the situation put a strain on it.* - Thu Oct 29 22:30:49 2015

"If you didn't know, I don't usually try to kill the person I l---" He cut himself off, as he simply spoke:

"The person...I care about." He stated, his gaze averted to the side.* - Thu Oct 29 22:41:55 2015
