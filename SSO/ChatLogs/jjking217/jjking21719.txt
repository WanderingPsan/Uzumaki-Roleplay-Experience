He paused as he spoke:

"I'm nothing special,  But either way. What you did, It doesn't make you a murderer. You didn't kill her without a reason, She endangered your safety. She tried to kill you. So I will never think of you as a murderer Kat, You acted in self-defense. You were just a victim of unfortunate circumstances." He spoke, looking over to her.* - Sat Oct 31 12:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: What if it's simply because, I took out someone in her bingo book? - Sat Oct 31 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I mean we all know she isn't the smartest. - Sat Oct 31 14:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked to Katsune, as he was a master of assumptions and when she said she was attracted to Kirie. His mind went to the obvious first assumption, before blinking as she spoke using the word sex, he coughed a bit, there was a grin on his face, that could give away his thoughts from a glance. "W-Well then...So what would y-you reccomend?" He asked curiously.* - Sat Oct 31 14:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) scooted a bit closer as he spoke "I don't know Kat, You're my leash.  I may be suicidal, But I'm hoping you'll keep be from doing something completely retarded." He stated, his hand moving to grasp her own as he said that. He looked at her, and his expression relaxed a bit.* - Sat Oct 31 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) didn't seem to mind, he'd gotten use to Kat's quirks, but he did smile warmly, feeling her squeeze and begin kneading his hand. As he spoke "There was something, I didn't tell you. I wasn't sure if you'd like it, It isn't a bad thing." But he stopped his gaze falling to her hand as she held his own, he felt there was a possibility she'd like it as well.* - Sat Oct 31 14:53:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her, as her leg moved atop of her hip, and the slight force which pushed him onto his back. He swallowed hard,  feeling her hands upon his stomach. He looked up to her staring back into her eyes, he wanted to see them vibrant with life. He could only imagine the events which led her to having that shield up. But just once, he'd like to see the shield lowered. As she spoke he spoke:

"That's. Possible, After all this is done. I'm sure we'll be able to go on a vacation...You definately deserve it."* - Sat Oct 31 15:25:52 2015

"I won't let anyone take your life...And Marissa she'll definately get what's comming to her one way or another." He stated, continuing to stare into her eyes. Katsune was strong, stronger than he was mentally he desired to one day stand beside her be able to help her without being the one always receiving.* - Sat Oct 31 15:42:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her as he simply stated "That's a hard question, I can't say for sure....But I feel like....If you do try and kill her...You must be willing....To erase everything they are, and everything they will be. Their potential for good and evil, are all gone, the moment you kill her. So for cases like this...Where you have the leisure of stopping and thinking about it. I think you should...If you believe she'll do more harm than good in the long run...Then do it, if not I think it's better you wait to see how things play out." 

He held a faint pinkening of his cheeks, feeling her bare hips. He looked up to her, as his hands, lightly moved back and forth with gentle motions.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looks to her as it was placed onto his stomach he looked up to her but watching her expression as her hands fell onto his sides. He didn't say anything he just watched her, he hoped she'd like what was in it. * - Sat Oct 31 16:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) simply watched as she opened the box, he didn't say anything but slowly he watched as she looked at the contents, and silently he hoped she enjoyed the present he had been saving up for it..But she already knew she was getting it, he just hoped that there was still...Some excitement to be tied to the present.* - Sat Oct 31 16:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as she looks at the items before pushing them off to the side, he was thinking maybe she didn't like it. He watched as she leaned forward and her hands touched the matress beside his head. Swallowing as her face came closer to his own, only to feel her lips against his own, and immediately it felt like his worries had escaped his mind for the most part. 

He definately had no intention of stopping the kiss. And as such he felt his heart beginning to race, but for now he was in his 'own world'. And was only focusing on the person before him.* - Sat Oct 31 16:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was seeming to be enjoying it as she kissed him, not minding the change in angles, in fact they added some sort of excitement. As she finished he felt himself almost craving for more as she gaze him a light peck, before her arms wrapped around his chest and her face resting there.His breathing was a tad bit heavier, but his eyes closed as she moved to find a comfortable position.

"You're welcome Kat...." He stated, his arms attempting to wrap around her back in a hug. He knew that this time was stressful for them both, but he wasn't sure how to ease that stress. But the one thing he did know...Was that he'd have to work through it.* - Sat Oct 31 16:29:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as she took his shirt in hand, and used it to hide herself. He looked at her, before he sighed but it was in relief almost. As he spoke "Who knows? But....We'll learn from these experiences."* - Sat Oct 31 17:33:00 2015
