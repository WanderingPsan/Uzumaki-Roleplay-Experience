<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Water and Earth, but i've not really any experience in either. - Mon Oct 26 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Elon. - Mon Oct 26 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Would you care to teach the new one some Suiton or Doton techniques? - Mon Oct 26 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Thank you. - Mon Oct 26 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: 'Tis Mana. - Mon Oct 26 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Alright. Nice to meet ya' Mana. - Mon Oct 26 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: So, I guess to begin...Is it safe to assume ya' don't know the Suimen technique? - Mon Oct 26 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I do not. - Mon Oct 26 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Alright...We'll start there then. - Mon Oct 26 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Well, you see how the Mizukage and I are standing on this here water, right? - Mon Oct 26 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 26 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I usually just go for a swim when I need to give her something. - Mon Oct 26 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Heh. Alright. - Mon Oct 26 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Well... - Mon Oct 26 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: The Suimen technique is used to walk across water. It's also good when you wanna go for a climb, like say you wanna climb that tree over to your left there. - Mon Oct 26 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Of course though, the tree is easier since it's not really movin' or nothin'. - Mon Oct 26 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: To actually use the technique, ya' gotta focus some chakra into your feet. Nice and even, then you should be able to walk on it smoothly. - Mon Oct 26 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Too little chakra and you'll just slip. Too much and you'll probably hurt ya'self in some other way. Who knows. Just uh...If you do mess up, be careful. - Mon Oct 26 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Got it so far? - Mon Oct 26 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 26 04:24:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: I want you to try it out on that tree real quick then. - Mon Oct 26 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Eh? Oh. - Mon Oct 26 04:33:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Eh... - Mon Oct 26 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) thinks: What do I usually teach next... - Mon Oct 26 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Did madam mizukage say we're family? - Mon Oct 26 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Eh? She never said nothin' about that to me. - Mon Oct 26 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Oh. I was going to ask if you never got tired. - Mon Oct 26 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Normally I don't heh. - Mon Oct 26 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: But uh... - Mon Oct 26 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Say...What'cha know of Suiton and Doton so far? - Mon Oct 26 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I can make a wave of water. - Mon Oct 26 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Alright... - Mon Oct 26 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: I'll teach ya' two techniques today. - Mon Oct 26 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: And from then on, I'll teach ya' more as I master more. - Mon Oct 26 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: The first technique I'll show ya' is Suiton-natured. - Mon Oct 26 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: It's pretty basic, just a stream of water really. Nothin' too fancy. - Mon Oct 26 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Since it's so basic, it's not as powerful as the wave technique you're talkin' about. At least for someone who's starting out with it. - Mon Oct 26 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Hm... - Mon Oct 26 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 26 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: This technique is pretty good for escape. - Mon Oct 26 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: It's also really useful when you wanna get around without being hit by some random ninja. - Mon Oct 26 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Is it that burrowing jutsu? - Mon Oct 26 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Eh? Yeah. - Mon Oct 26 05:25:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Heh. That's good. - Mon Oct 26 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: It's a great technique, most people can't really counter it. Since they uh...Can't really tell you're down there. - Mon Oct 26 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Or where you are when your'e down there. - Mon Oct 26 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Right. - Mon Oct 26 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Only problem is my chakra is more or less gone after that short session. - Mon Oct 26 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Physically I can go forever, but I guess i'm lacking mentally. - Mon Oct 26 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Eh, with enough practice ya' won't even notice the drain. - Mon Oct 26 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Anyways uh, I guess I should leave ya' to practice'em or somethin'...? - Mon Oct 26 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Up to you. I'm pretty bored. - Mon Oct 26 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Well I don't do much 'round here 'cept train and do missions so I don't think I could really entertain ya'. - Mon Oct 26 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I built a house earlier. It was pretty interesting. - Mon Oct 26 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Heh, yeah, the Mizukage gives me that mission all the time. - Mon Oct 26 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: How many have you built? - Mon Oct 26 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Just 'bout four or five. - Mon Oct 26 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Sounds like fun. I made one, but I made it especially for myself. - Mon Oct 26 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Oh? I ain't ever done that. - Mon Oct 26 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: I'm a nature man m'self so I don't really need a home. - Mon Oct 26 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Nature man, huh? You sleep in the trees and such? - Mon Oct 26 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Pretty much. - Mon Oct 26 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Do you know the technique to release genjutsu? - Mon Oct 26 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Nah...Never got the chance to learn it. - Mon Oct 26 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Normally don't need it. I just see through genjutsu anyways. - Mon Oct 26 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: O - Mon Oct 26 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'm going to assume you're fairly good at sensing? - Mon Oct 26 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Yeah. I specialize in it. - Mon Oct 26 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: That's nice. I was thinking about going for hand to hand. - Mon Oct 26 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: Oh? I thought about that m'self when I was younger. - Mon Oct 26 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Elon(Chevy Corolla) says: But I'm not really one for fightin' t'be honest. - Mon Oct 26 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Makes sense. - Mon Oct 26 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: It's a gruesome thing, but I figure someone has to do it. - Mon Oct 26 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'll be that someone if it's to benefit those precious to me. - Mon Oct 26 06:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: So that they may not have to. - Mon Oct 26 06:19:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) stood as he headed over into the kitchen, and slowly he began taking out an assortment of ingredients before proceeding to fill a pot with water and allow it to begin boiling on the stove. Honestly he had an idea to mess with Katsune, but first he began cutting up the ingredients which consisted of Chicken, leeks, and some noodles. Starting the broth, as the water began to boil, he began to knock all of the ingredients into the water before he headed to the cabinet and began slowly pouring hot sauce into the broth. 

Not enough to be overbearing, but enough to be considered extremely spicy. And as such once it was done cooking, he slowly filled her up a bowl before returning to her, with chopsticks. As well as a glass of water as he spoke "Eat up." He seemed to be in an awefully cheery mood, he wondered what her reaction would be.* - Mon Oct 26 21:01:39 2015

"S-So...H-How is it Kat?" He asked. Looking at her, his eyes watering up for an entirely different reason.* - Mon Oct 26 21:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as she finished the soup he moved to attempt and grab the bowl as she set her legs atop of his lap.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: She already knows that I usually don't use my brain so talking sense into me doesn't really work. - Mon Oct 26 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Get me into trouble and I'll handle it, yeah. - Mon Oct 26 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmmmm. - Mon Oct 26 21:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What exactly will you be doing Kilm? - Mon Oct 26 21:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: After the four months of training . . . I'll be gathering info on Konohagakure and maybe Kumogakure as well. - Mon Oct 26 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And see what I can do inside. - Mon Oct 26 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why? - Mon Oct 26 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I don't want more tyrants. - Mon Oct 26 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Specifically what are your plans? - Mon Oct 26 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Find out what 'Zeus' is like and more about his abilities in Konohagakure . . . Perhaps even what the abilities of all other shinobi are as well. - Mon Oct 26 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Depending on what I find out . . . I'll either let him be for now or attack him. - Mon Oct 26 21:57:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wanna know why I was asking him questions? - Mon Oct 26 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm, Sure if you're willing to tell. - Mon Oct 26 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wanted to see whether or not he was hiding things. Judging by his answers he obviously was. - Mon Oct 26 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wasn't hoping for answers. Wasn't expecting them. Just wanted to see if he'd be open. - Mon Oct 26 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wasn't. - Mon Oct 26 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Finally after years he's been blatantly cut off from any chance of ever being with me. - Mon Oct 26 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure how he'll act now. - Mon Oct 26 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Always suspected his loyalty was due to loneliness. - Mon Oct 26 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That it was completely selfish. - Mon Oct 26 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If that's true, he could be a very different person now. Someone I've never known before. - Mon Oct 26 22:35:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's never beat me in a fight aside from a few times when I let him. - Mon Oct 26 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's always been either a stalemate or his loss. One time I let him put me in genjutsu and one time he beat a shadow clone that wasn't anywhere near as strong as me -- had half of my chakra. - Mon Oct 26 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But he's never won. - Mon Oct 26 22:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If the only danger was him maybe attacking me in the future I'd not even consider it. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He'll never beat me, even if he copies my fighting style out of desperation which I suspect he will. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The problem is, he might train other people. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Teach them how to fly. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If he's that stupid. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then it's for the better. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm having trouble figuring him out. - Mon Oct 26 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I don't know, I'm finding him fairly easy to read. - Mon Oct 26 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think I know what I'll do. - Mon Oct 26 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm's always handed me techniques back to back like it's candy. - Mon Oct 26 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If he stops, I'll know he's planning on betraying me. - Mon Oct 26 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll watch him and see. - Mon Oct 26 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The second I see him being stupid, I'll put my fist to his head...and end it. - Mon Oct 26 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would slowly look towards Kat, before his gaze shifted to her legs and by extension her feet which resided atop of his lap. As he slowly moved to grasp one of her feet, had she allowed him, with a gentle motion he'd begin slowly massaging it as his gaze shifted back to her, he figured since she wasn't feeling One hundred percent he could at least help her relax while he talked to her.

" I see,  My only fear is that, When he runs off and does something stupid with the Gezo, They won't kill him. It's possible they'll torture him to find out who else knew about this plan."* - Mon Oct 26 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just worried he might try to take Konoha from me. - Mon Oct 26 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) closed his eyes briefly, kneading a bit further into the flesh at least as far as he could go without causing pain. He'd slowly lighten up his motions, as he listened to her words as he spoke:

"I know,  But it's better safe than sorry." He admitted as he transitoned to the ball of her foot, using his thumbs, as he moved them in a circular motion applying only the smallest bit of pressure which gradually increased before softening up again.

"And if he thinks he's taking Konoha from you, He won't have to worry about the Gezo."* - Mon Oct 26 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Even if his friendship is a lie, and always has been a lie. . . - Mon Oct 26 22:48:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You don't have to kill him, You could imprison him. - Mon Oct 26 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The truth is, without me watching over his shoulder, he "will" die. . . - Mon Oct 26 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If he's ambitious. - Mon Oct 26 22:50:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Might be why he teaches me things. - Mon Oct 26 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway no. I'd never imprison him. - Mon Oct 26 22:52:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Although for all intents and purposes, I'm doing this for you not him. - Mon Oct 26 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You really shouldn't. - Mon Oct 26 23:12:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: When you take over Konoha....Could I come with you? - Mon Oct 26 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. Of course. - Mon Oct 26 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I want you there. - Mon Oct 26 23:20:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He has no brains but he's surprisingly great at getting power. - Mon Oct 26 23:26:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: People think I can get inside their head. They act like that worries them. - Mon Oct 26 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So they try to protect themselves. - Mon Oct 26 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They start assuming every single thing I say is a lie. - Mon Oct 26 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So when I give amazingly good advice, they don't listen. - Mon Oct 26 23:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So you were? - Mon Oct 26 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But...Not directly? - Mon Oct 26 23:42:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I realized how useful he could be, so I did everything I could to help him...for my own sake. I shared my intelligence with him. - Mon Oct 26 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Made him unstoppable. - Mon Oct 26 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He realized I was telling him things for selfish reasons. That's what set him off. - Mon Oct 26 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What he didn't realize. . . - Mon Oct 26 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Was that nothing I said was harmful to him in any way. - Mon Oct 26 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He was intimidated by my intelligence. He wanted to feel like he was in control. - Mon Oct 26 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kind've like Zetsumo. - Mon Oct 26 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Most men do. - Mon Oct 26 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But. . . - Mon Oct 26 23:44:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I had to make sure he wasn't able to be in control. - Mon Oct 26 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Immortal? How is that even possible? - Mon Oct 26 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I needed leverage. - Mon Oct 26 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.....immortality. - Mon Oct 26 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno but. . . - Mon Oct 26 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He split his chest open in front of me and didn't die. - Mon Oct 26 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He did die eventually though. - Mon Oct 26 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So his immortality was limited. - Mon Oct 26 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So...He wasn't actually immortal? - Mon Oct 26 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Well...Not sticking to the definition One hundred percent. - Mon Oct 26 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. I have pretty much no idea how it worked. - Mon Oct 26 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My mistake with Erebus. . . - Mon Oct 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Was that I let him know I was in control of my situation. - Mon Oct 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Mon Oct 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I didn't hide it. I don't lie after all. - Mon Oct 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I let him know. - Mon Oct 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In the future I think it'll be a good idea to not...do that. - Mon Oct 26 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Mind if I lay beside you my legs are falling asleep, Haha. - Mon Oct 26 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Mon Oct 26 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But yeah, That's probably ideal in the future. - Mon Oct 26 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her as he waited for her to move, before he'd slowly move onto his side, with his back against the back of the couch. In which case, he'd lay on his side, with his head near hers. Probably in a manner that could be considered cuddling, as he placed his elbow on the cushion, and rested his cheek upon it as he looked at her.

"So...Tell me Kat, What do you actually have planned for Konoha? I'm sure you didn't just plan to take over and leave it as is."* - Mon Oct 26 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Aside from that? No real plans. - Mon Oct 26 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If people want to beat each other in the face with cold, hard gauntlets? That's fine by me. I won't stop it. - Mon Oct 26 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But murder? Rape? Not gonna happen. - Mon Oct 26 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as she began repositioning herself, and upon feeling her butt pressing against his crotch as she laid alongside him he developed a faint blush. Fairly happy, she wasn't facing him since he was consious of his own embarrassment so he was happy he spared her from the sight. He swallowed hard, but didn't actually say anything for a bit, he felt his heart beginning to race. As he tried to focus on the situation, and calm his nerves.

"I see, It doesn't sound like a b-bad place. But...would y-you still follow the system of Shinobi..? Or make your own?"* - Tue Oct 27 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No idea. - Tue Oct 27 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll have jounin, chuunin, and genin at least at first. . . - Tue Oct 27 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll go with what's worked for everyone else, at first. - Tue Oct 27 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And then? - Tue Oct 27 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll fix problems as they come up. - Tue Oct 27 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not gonna try and make some unique situation just to feel unique. - Tue Oct 27 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's what people with self-esteem issues do. - Tue Oct 27 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'd really like to see the village you envision. - Tue Oct 27 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll have to make sure, I'm there when that dream comes to a realit. - Tue Oct 27 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: reality* - Tue Oct 27 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would decide---Whatever cell in his brain possessed him to even consider this, he'd slowly raise his arm and attempt to move it forward to Katsune's waist and attempt to wrap it around in a 'hug', persay. He would've left his arm there unless she showed any signs of protest as he spoke:

"Although..I feel like no matter the Village if you're running it, It'll be a pretty interesting sight.. And it'd be something worth fighting for."* - Tue Oct 27 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was being surprised by Katsune all over the place lately, and that was partially what he enjoyed. He wasn't expecting her to move closer once, again and his struggle to remain focused was by all means an uphill battle that he was losing more ground by the second. Her head would probably be somewhere against his upper chest, if not right beneath his own chin. 

"But once you take over Konoha, You'll make me a Jounin or something else cool right~?" He joked.* - Tue Oct 27 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Probably. - Tue Oct 27 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You'd be at least a chuunin. I'll need to make sure you're strong before that can happen though. - Tue Oct 27 00:15:21 2015
