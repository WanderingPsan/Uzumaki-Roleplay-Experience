<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) didnt' release her throughout the entire processr. Enjoying this up close and personal view of her change, his eyes widened for a moment. As he observed the change in her body "Your skin... Your shape, Hair....It's all changed...That   quickly?" It was definately an interesting ability, and the voice was fairly soothing. 

"Do you have to see the person to become them? This Owari person was she someone else first?"* - Sat Nov 21 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head as he gazed over the body of her new form "Seems like I'm taller than you now~." He spoke, in a surprisingly joking manner.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Is it possible that you can take a different form a day? It'd be interesting to meet the new personas. Should a situation arise, it'd be easy for me to react if I knew your personas in and out. - Sat Nov 21 14:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...that is difficult. - Sat Nov 21 14:01:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And it takes the original nature out of it when I do need to make someone. - Sat Nov 21 14:01:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: How about.... - Sat Nov 21 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched her form beginning to change, as he blinked, this new form was nothing he had seen before. It was unique, and beautiful, it was definately pleasing to the eye. As he stared into her eyes "Mismatched?" He commented, but even in their state. He found the hair and eye combo to be truly extroadinary.  He leaned in staring inro her eyes as he commented. "I....like it." It was genuine, and he hadn't actually observed the change for the rest of her body, there was a lot that caught his eye on her head.* - Sat Nov 21 14:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) his hand raised up to her cheek, examining her pale flesh. As it drifted down the side of her cheek, down to her neck.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her body, as she stood, and he blinked, examining her figure from just first glance. From her breasts, to her hips down to her legs and feet. And finally her curves, he had never taken interests in all of this until last night. "U-Uh..when you turn around slowly.....Rotate?"* - Sat Nov 21 14:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) scanned her back with his eyes followed by her butt as he swallowed hard. Looking up to her as he moved to lay down on his back, staring into her eyes. "Y-Yeah I like this f-form...all of it."* - Sat Nov 21 14:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked to her as she sat down he closed his eyes, he contemplated a name which he felt would suit one whose imperfections, made her perfect in his eyes. As he spoke "Yuriko."* - Sat Nov 21 15:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) reached for her hand, almost subconciously. He once again didn't understand the gesture, as he turned to face her he simply spoke "A girl...with a Hundred Perfections, alternatively read as "A girl with a Hundred Identities."." He stated, with a smile, happy to have come up with a name that fit her. "Do you like it..?"* - Sat Nov 21 15:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Then lets go. - Sat Nov 21 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) followed in pursuit, just as naked, running a single hand through his hair as he looked at her, before scratching his cheek. As he spoke "I've never even been off this floor." He was obviously, a bit nervous, despite not knowing what the feeling was...Not that he'd care to admit it.* - Sat Nov 21 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Well don't go having a panic attack. - Sat Nov 21 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll try.. - Sat Nov 21 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved to grasp her hand moreso because he felt she knew what she was doing she was more experienced in the outside world than he was. And he was definately nervous, quit ironic considering she was currently smaller than him yet he felt 'secure' holding her hand.* - Sat Nov 21 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) eyes scanned his Horizon, and they were no doubt getting glances as they walked through the halls naked. He held onto her hand tightly, he was a bit scared to be going up to the surface, he saw numerous types of people and guards, more than he had ever known was in this building. And as they exited, he swallowed hard, feeling the grass beneath his feet as they walked, and when that grass transitioned to sand he looked towards her, as he saw the large body of water..His draw practically dropped.* - Sat Nov 21 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was simply awestricken, as he looked at the natural sky, which seemed to never end as well as the water. "H-How is this possible? There's no end in sight..!" He exlaimed, though his grip on her hand never lessened he was still quite nervous, "W-Wow.." He stated, feeling the subtle breeze against his nude form, he shivered. He looked like a kid who had been taken to an amusement park that he always wanted to go to, but was to nervous to run off and explore.* - Sat Nov 21 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) swallowed hard, as he did release her hand for a moment, as he moved closer to the water's edge before crouching in front of it. "Is....this really....all water...?" He asked in disbelief.* - Sat Nov 21 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) (*Thirteen swallowed hard, as he did release her hand for a moment, as he moved closer to the water's edge before crouching in front of it. "Is....this really....all water...?" He asked in disbelief.*)* - Sat Nov 21 16:48:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You mentioned swimming before...How does that go? - Sat Nov 21 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know how to swim. - Sat Nov 21 16:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No one taught me and you will drown but I can't. - Sat Nov 21 16:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Uh... you do a lot of leg kicking and arm swooping stuff. - Sat Nov 21 16:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'll show you...but you should be careful because I can just show you I don't know how to teach you like they did.  - Sat Nov 21 16:58:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he slowly slipped into the water, he was shivering but it was only up to his ankles, and slowly he moved further in until it was at his waist, he decided this would be the perfect height. He shivered, as he looked towards Ume as he spoke "This is...beautiful..I never..would've been able to see this without you."* - Sat Nov 21 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt her hands grab his own, and he looked to her before looking into the water "Mines....to see." He repeated, and a small innocent smile graced his face,  "I like...this feeling of freedom."* - Sat Nov 21 17:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Good. - Sat Nov 21 17:11:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Can we lay on the grass? It felt soft. - Sat Nov 21 17:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Sat Nov 21 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took her hand as offered to him, as he was pulled up the cliff with Ume's assistance, laying down on the soft grass he'd speak "This place....This freedom...I like it a lot."* - Sat Nov 21 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved to mount her stomach as he sat on top of her, he'd look down at her as he spoke "Is water always that cold? Is it always the same outside?"* - Sat Nov 21 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked as he leaned in closer watching her lips move as she spoke "What's Snow or rain?" He asked, his eyes widened "And what are Seasons?" He seemed to have gotten another spurt of curiosity.* - Sat Nov 21 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You will just have to experience them, I don't know how to describe them how you will experience them. - Sat Nov 21 17:33:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Is grass always Green? - Sat Nov 21 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No, sometimes it's brown. - Sat Nov 21 17:38:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What do you want to learn? - Sat Nov 21 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Everything! - Sat Nov 21 17:46:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah. - Sat Nov 21 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'd like to... - Sat Nov 21 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled a bit, as he leaned forward, and wrapped his arms around her torso. Pulling her in as he gave her a hug, he did seem very happy...And he looked..-very- human.* - Sat Nov 21 17:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) tilts his head to the side in a bit of confusion "Mean and demanding?" He asked, a bit confused, by what she was asking "What do you mean..?" He asked.* - Sat Nov 21 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thought about it as he replied "Oh...It was weird...I felt...so many emotions....I couldn't...resist..? I think that's the right word....There was something I craved to do...It was weird." He did look once again confused by last night's actions.* - Sat Nov 21 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated what she was saying, but based off of the one time, it occured. He nodded his head, as his gaze trailed over her body. "Is it...bad?"* - Sat Nov 21 18:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared into her eyes "Do you?" He asked, his hand resting upon her chest in this moment as he spoke "What kind of stuff was left to you?"* - Sat Nov 21 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What do you mean? - Sat Nov 21 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: What does that have to do with what we are talking about? - Sat Nov 21 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "Anything that may explain this...Notes...anything that...weird feeling....? The behavior?"* - Sat Nov 21 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No, there is nothing. - Sat Nov 21 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And even what I know I won't tell you. - Sat Nov 21 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ....You..know stuff? - Sat Nov 21 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Watching you is entertaining. - Sat Nov 21 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: Entertaining...? - Sat Nov 21 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm... - Sat Nov 21 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at how small she was in comparison to himself, his hand moved down from her breast, before resting on the center of her stomach. His other hand moved to the top of her head, lightly combing through her dual colored hair with her finger tips. "I'm glad...you took this form, for me Yuriko."He stated as he stared into her heterochromatic eyes. Don't to her pink lips, where his eyes remained for the longest of time.

"When I'm ready to leave...Will you come with me?"* - Sat Nov 21 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared into her eyes, as he spoke "I'm fine with going to places you desire to go...I know nothing of the outside world. I wish to see it all anyway...meaning where you want to go is also where I desire to go." He stated his hand moving from her stomach to her hip. 

"Where would be the first place you go?" He asked, leaning forward until their foreheads touched, the hand that was once on her head, went to her neck, his four fingers, going along the side of her neck, while his thumb rested across the center. Applying no pressure, as he stared at her.* - Sat Nov 21 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) kept his hands where they were as he spoke "I don't like talking about myself, I'm not complete. And there are many components I do not understand." He admitted, staring back into her eyes with his own hazel ones.* - Sat Nov 21 18:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But I find it interesting when you do those things. - Sat Nov 21 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: We don't have to talk about it. - Sat Nov 21 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You can just....do them. - Sat Nov 21 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I won't stop you from talking about it. Not if you want. - Sat Nov 21 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't need to talk about it. - Sat Nov 21 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) leaned to the side, and placed his lips against against her neck, kissing it subtly.  "But, I hate my own imperfections." He stated lightly,  before rolling off of her as he laid on his own back. He simply spoke "I see, that's good then." He closed his eyes briefly before he spoke "Yuriko...come lay atop of me." He stated, quite a weird request, but he was exploring now. His voice had a certain coldness, much like it had been the day before. He felt his blood boiling all of a sudden.* - Sat Nov 21 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head "Go ahead." He stated, referring to her sitting atop of him as he looked at her. "You don't think so?" He asked, wondering what her opinion of who he was; was. He took a deep breath, He wondered how light she could be, but he honestly wasn't surprised that such a thing was possible, he was still expecting a fairly decent amount of wait. Few things surprised him with Ume.* - Sat Nov 21 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared into her eyes as she allowed the rest of her weight to rest on him, it wasn't that noticable. But his hands moved to her back, gently rubbing upon it in a circular fashion. Before his left hand trailed down her back, before resting on her butt. He'd take a deep breath, "I wondered last night...What I'd be doing if you never ran into my room while I was chained up...What experiments would've been performed on me."* - Sat Nov 21 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Probably bad ones... - Sat Nov 21 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) he nodded his head "Yeah you're right, I wouldn't be here right now if that was the case." He applied a bit of pressure to the hand that was on her butt, aiming to press her butt down upon his cock. As he spoke "I owe you a lot, Yuriko, and you continue to help me and look out for me." He stated, as he aimed to lean forward and kiss her cheek,  

"I want to say thank you, But I feel like the best way to thank you, is to not squander this chance you've given me."* - Sat Nov 21 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) bit his bottom lip, as he felt his attempt succeed, with her now sitting atop of him. His member began showing signs of arousal beneath her, as she rested her head on his chest.  "Yeah...I know I don't need to, But I -want- to." He stared lightly. His left hand moving to the top of her head as she rested against him, and moved to lightly stroke her hair. While his right, roughly squeezed and massaged her butt. * - Sat Nov 21 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) continued petting her head, as he simply spoke "I like the feeling of it against my finger tips, does it make you uncomfortable?" He asked, as he gave one of her cheeks a hard squeeze. He closed his eyes for the most part, concentrating on the feeling of their naked bodies touching eachother.* - Sat Nov 21 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as he spoke "I'm definately looking forward to when I can~." He stated lightly, he wondered how she'd look when she was made uncomfortable. As he slowly spoke "Do you think you can do what we were doing yesterday?" He asked, he was definately getting to that point again. But he was looking forward to training after. * - Sat Nov 21 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared at her as he spoke "Yeah, I want you to understand, the emotions others feel. From a third person perspective, You've already seen them from the perspective as one who has never had emotions. But the way you look at Humans, the world...May be changed when you gain emotions. I need you to be able to utilize that to your advantage, something I can't do. I don't think I can ever experience sympathy, regret. But you will become what I cannot." He stated lightly.* - Sat Nov 21 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head "I don't want you to feel them, I want you to understand them. Let me rephrase that...To have the capacity to feel them, I won't wish any of those onto you. But you'll never be 'complete' if you don't have those emotions."* - Sat Nov 21 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can't understand them without feeling them. - Sat Nov 21 19:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head "I know, and that's what makes that a contradiction. I want you to understand them, But I don't want you to feel them." He paused as he looked at her as he spoke: 

"But....My question to you Ume is...Are you trying to become Human?"* - Sat Nov 21 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as she growled, "That actually is comforting." He stated, his hand leaving her butt, before wrapping around her back, he hugged her tightly.* - Sat Nov 21 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "I just feel like I don't like when people try to be something they aren't. So I'm happy you like what you are...If that makes sense."* - Sat Nov 21 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...I like what I am but I still want emotions. - Sat Nov 21 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So ....I still want to be something more. - Sat Nov 21 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: There's a difference between trying to change your race, and trying to aquire something to better yourself. - Sat Nov 21 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I see. - Sat Nov 21 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Ume let's go and train for a bit? - Sat Nov 21 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I guess. - Sat Nov 21 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he inhaled followed by a brief exhale as he spoke "I think I've had enough of being outside." He stated, he had had enough fun for the time being, he had other stuff to focus on. "Ume, let's head inside." Afterwards, once she stood he'd stand after her, before he looked towards the base and the soldiers. "What can you tell me about the Shinobi World?" He asked, Ume, as he began to walk into the base.* - Sat Nov 21 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head as he spoke "And the Shinobi system itself? Who regulates it?" He asked, as he headed to their room, and began to put on his underwear followed by a jumpsuit and an overshirt. A switch seemed to flip, as he took a deep breath, he wanted to learn about this world, he didn't want to be just free, he wanted...to understand the world around him, and make it pay for being a silent bystander as he was forced to endure years of torture.* - Sat Nov 21 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) had been walking through the halls, and he took a deep breath. Shaking his head, as he then spoke "Who are the Gezo?" He asked, and once they arrived back to their room, he began putting clothes on.  He ran a single hand through his hair, he honestly didn't mind his nudity. But he planned to pay a visit to the scientists, and he didn't think people would take him seriously in the nude.* - Sat Nov 21 20:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) walked forward as he spoke "I'm going to pay a visit to the scientists, I think it's about time...We watch them more carefully, all their research...We could have them start working towards something beneficial to us. " He stated lightly, "Could you have one of the guards look for all information regarding the Gezo while we're gone?" He asked Ume, with a slight smile, as he spoke "But before that...Shall we find you something to wear?"* - Sat Nov 21 20:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled for a moment as she asked about him killing more of them "No, I won't kill any of them. Not a single hair shall be harmed." He stated, as he looked into her closet, he examined the current appearance of Yuriko. And rubbed his cheek, he figured she didn't have a problem not wearing underclothes as he simply spoke "How about this?" He reached forward taking out three things, a white blouse, and a pair of grey dress pants. And then finally, a pair of hills which were grey in color. And he set it down, in front of her, as he spoke "Is this to your liking?"* - Sat Nov 21 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as he spoke "I was thinking about something, you're the leader so when you're outside in front of them...You should dress like the leader. Humans, associate clothing with positions of power, so if you dress the part. People will think of you as so. They'll be less likely to try and betray you that way." He stated, looking around he searched for a pair of boots as he added "Plus, It suits you."* - Sat Nov 21 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) walked closer as he reached to grasp both her hands in his own staring into her eyes. "They know you will, but....Eating them will begin to make production slower. If we can control them, without eating them we can increase production, I also have a way to get you a stable food source, besides those who betray you."* - Sat Nov 21 20:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated what she said as he asked "It is very plain...." Holding up a hand to stop her, he spoke "Let's look for a bit longer, there's no need to rush." He stated, motioning for her to follow him into the closest. "Does anything stand out?"* - Sat Nov 21 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) scratched his chin, as he looked at the closet, he looked towards her. "If you don't choose your clothing, do you prefer something specifically?" First he pulled out a light blue tank top, with a pair of short-shorts. Holding it up for her he set it down, before taking out a dress which went to just above the knees, it was white save for several black flower designs on it. He sat on the floor before her, this is your time to tell me what you 'want'.* - Sat Nov 21 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: .."This is your time to tell me what you want*" - Sat Nov 21 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he stood heading deeper into the closet, he slowly reached for a dark blue dress before offering it to her.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, as he asked "You like it?" After she had given an answer, he'd stand, offering her his hand, as he spoke "Let's go visit our....scientists." He stated, with a sly grin upon his face what irony! The science experiment comming to be higher than the scientists.* - Sat Nov 21 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He's using different pronouns now. - Sat Nov 21 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: 'our' - Sat Nov 21 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: 'we' - Sat Nov 21 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was led down to the research and development center, this was his first time actually having been here as he took a deep breath. Looking at Ume as she led him, he looked around the hallways, and took into account how truly massive this place was. He smiled to himself, as he leaned in to whisper, as he spoke "I was wondering, do you think we should begin the process of recruiting?"* - Sat Nov 21 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as he spoke "We have an army, It's only right we begin to find those worthy of being generals." He stated lightly, as they entered the Science division he'd speak to Ume as he spoke "It's time we found out some stuff."* - Sat Nov 21 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) had begun to put things together, seeing the sheer amount of rooms that seemed occupied. Along with the excessive amounts of guards on this base. "I'm not sure how many, but there are well over one hundred guards. In this base." He stated, as he added on "These seemed highly disciplined." He explained. As he stood in the doorway of the science department as he still held onto her hand. 

"Ready to address the masses?"* - Sat Nov 21 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked into the room as he cleared his throat "All scientists, may I have your attention?"  He spoke, watching for their reactions, as he looked around examining their faces, no doubt few would show fear of the male that stood before them. He was probably well known. He took a moment to let his prescence sink in if said moment was needed before he looked to Ume for approval to continue. 

(Wanna rp the scientists?)* - Sat Nov 21 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He seems to know what he's doing. - Sat Nov 21 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt her grasp on his hand, but made no comment as he smiled, sinisterly. "This woman here, Yuriko. She is -your- leader, You will abide by her rules." He opened his mouth to say more as one of the scientists, approached him and spoke:

"I'm sorry but you have to leave!"The male declared.

Thirteen responded by making a single handseal, and the male dropped to his knees, screaming out against some unknown terror which was attacking him. "Now...My name...Is Thirteen...And if there's one thing, I hate...It's being cut off." He stated, as he took a step down to the next step, where the scientist was scraming out upon, and reaching down, he rose the scientist to his feet. Before his hand was shot out.

Aiming to back hand the scientist down the few remaining steps, several surprised gasps were heard and screams of some female scientists, there were at least 80 scientists in here. And as the male hit the ground, blood dripped from his lips, and he no doubt had a broken arm. He wasn't dead just unconcious. He looked towards the scientists:

"All of your written notes, -now-, all Data pertaining experiments even those we don't know about. We want to see it all."* - Sat Nov 21 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched as some of the scientists began to scramble,  while others seemed anxious scared. "What are you guys waiting for?! -Move-." He commanded, as a few scientists, began to return with notebooks upon notebooks of items. Progressing further into the room, he  scanned the books. He'd have a lot of reading to do, but one of the scientists decided to try and retaliate, preparing a needle, the scientist aimed to run from his desk. And attempt to inject Thireen as he passed by. He was aiming to do this from Thirteen's blind spot which placed him right in front of Ume.* - Sat Nov 21 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stopped in his tracks, as he felt the resistence from Ume's movements, and his eyes widened as he saw her hand firmly grasping the scientist's throat with the needle in his hand. The male gasped out as the hand tightened around his throat, until ultimately he dropped the needle and nodded his head. Mostly out of a desire not to die, fear was etched onto his face, had he been dropped the man would mumble something about "This lab is being run by freaks!" As he ran off and began gathering notes, and other things that he offered to Thirteen ,whose gaze focused on the male. He opened his mouth, and his voice was cold and calculating:

"Yuriko, why don't you have a pre-dinner snack?"* - Sat Nov 21 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched as Ume released his hand and began pacing towards the scientist, his attention focused on the rest of them, who happily got in line as to avoid being a snack for Ume. Meanwhile the scientist that had instulted them,had tried to run leading himself into a corner. Since there was only one exit, to minimize the ability for patience to leave or for people to get in, he was practically trapped as he spoke "Freak! G-Get away from me!" Obviously the only way he'd learn is with his death.* - Sat Nov 21 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as he watched Ume devour the scientist, and his smile broadened when she said "Do what -we- say"" Man was he enjoying this, and he loved the look in her eyes, with the motivation given to them by Ume, the scientist scurried around the place tripping around eachother, as file after file was stacked in front of Thirteen. After a good thirty Minutes or so there were about six stacks of files, and Thirteen called for the guards, to take this to their room. Approaching Ume had she not already made it to him, he'd move to kiss her on the forehead, "Did you enjoy?" He asked with a sinister grin.* - Sat Nov 21 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her and examined her facial expression as he simply spoke "Are you still hungry?" He asked, looking to some of the scientists in the room, as he reached to grasp Ume's hand in his own, as he spoke "I'm sure, we can spare one to two more, if you'd like." He smiled, realising just how wonderful this time here was going to be.* - Sat Nov 21 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) he had done what he had accomplished and as such, he led her through the door as he spoke "Let's get you back to the room." Had she permitted he'd lead her to their room, where not only the information from the scientists, but information regarding the Gezo had been stored as they walked through the halls. "Do you need anything before we go to the room?"* - Sat Nov 21 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, as he felt her hand grasp onto his, and once they were in their room. He led her to the bed, before sitting down beside her. He took a deep breath, as he slowly picked up one of the notebooks, and began reading.* - Sat Nov 21 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yuriko, why the sudden desire to know everything? - Sat Nov 21 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I've wanted to know...but wasn't in a hurry. - Sat Nov 21 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) slowly went through book after book, breezing through them effortlessly and easily. After he finished one, he dropped it and moved onto the next one and continued doing it without stop, he was going at an almost impossible pace. "What has changed since then?"* - Sat Nov 21 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You were interested. - Sat Nov 21 23:21:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: All of those are fine...except the testers if you want them to stop that. - Sat Nov 21 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Just...to do with me.... - Sat Nov 21 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: They can't steal my abilities. - Sat Nov 21 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No one can have these abilities. - Sat Nov 21 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: There...was one file about me. - Sat Nov 21 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: They intended to make me a weapon. - Sat Nov 21 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll have them shut down the project regarding your DNA..But they....How? - Sat Nov 21 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: They were suppose to just find out what I am...and give me emotions. - Sat Nov 21 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That's it... - Sat Nov 21 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: How what? - Sat Nov 21 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Is that even possible? - Sat Nov 21 23:44:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...yeah. - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I was made. - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took a deep breath, as orders were told to the guards to discontinue the work regarding Ume's Regenerative powers.

"Two years old.." 

The Guard with Index's will returned to Ume and gave Thirteen the letter since Ume couldn't read.* - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I knew you were made...Just not how long. - Sat Nov 21 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I have Yosuke's will...Do you want me to read it to you? - Sat Nov 21 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...yah. - Sat Nov 21 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked as his eyes found the paper as he began to read off:

"For those I left behind, and for my dear Chihiro I leave behind all I possess:

Fifteen Million Yen

The entire base in which you currently reside.

The Scientists.

All Three Thousand Three hundred and Fifty Soldiers.

My collection of technique scrolls. 

To Chihiro, I know I had a hard time saying this before. But...You're the one I cared for most in this world, even more than myself, and If you're reading this I'm probably dead, but even in the afterlife. I will hold you close to my heart, and pray that you never end up here beside me--At least not soon. I will think of you every day...There's only one thing left for me to say, Chihiro...I love you...stay safe and live on. I entrust to you, all that I have amassed over these years upon Iselea. I hope you think kindly of me...

---Love...
             Yosuke, The Iselean.* - Sun Nov 22 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) definately blinked he was a bit startled by her sudden uproar, he hadn't been expecting this...This was probably the most emotion she had shown around him, and that startled him. He heard her scream, which left his ears ringing, he watched the chair break against the wall, and when she ended up on the floor. He sighed, at first he intended to let her have her moment. But then he moved to sit beside her, staring at the wall. He didn't say anything for a good while, but his hand would move to find her head, and gently began petting. He didn't say anything it wouldn't have been right.* - Sun Nov 22 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her and after a while, he moved to maneuver before he, if permitted, he'd allow her to use his lap as a pillow instead of the ground as he continued petting her. "Ume, I think I understand a bit more....Do you want to avenge him...Yosuke?" He asked staring down at her.* - Sun Nov 22 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) just continued petting her, allowing her to go through this in her own way.* - Sun Nov 22 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) assumingly laid and petted Ume's head until she got tired of it, or until he slumped over against the wall, so when he awoke. He wiped his lips,  blinking a few times. Before looking to Ume how she was doing.* - Sun Nov 22 10:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked down to her as he listened to her speaking. As he simply spoke "I know I didn't have to but I told you I'd stay by your side. " After a moment he would've stood, heading to the bathroom, he decided to drain the lizard, and wash up. After about fifteen minutes he returned, looking as fresh as could be.  He'd take a seat beside her as he reached for one of the notebooks regarding the Gezo Empire. 

"Ume, what're you doing today?"* - Sun Nov 22 10:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as her as he spoke "So we reward them, and then in a few hours we bring them up." He suggested, as he looked at the dress Ume,was wearing his hand ran down the back of it as he spoke "You know you don't have to wear anything when it's just the two of us." He stated lightly, as his hand returned to the notebook and he continued reading, he didn't mind holding a conversation as he did so.* - Sun Nov 22 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stifled a bit of laughter as he spoke "I was thinking, why not let them have a party? I noticed through some of their notes, it's day after day, I doubt they get days odd, why not give them one?" He asked as he finished the first notepad, and placed it off to the side, before taking another in his hand, he was learning quite a bit about the Gezo from Yosuke's notes.* - Sun Nov 22 11:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah... we could do that... - Sun Nov 22 11:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then after the party is done, we can easily have them come up here, to my calculations. - Sun Nov 22 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: The question is what do we do while that occurs? - Sun Nov 22 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved his hand to her head, as he lightly ran his fingers through it. "I've read something interesting,---And That sounds good." He stood up, and slowly headed to the door pushing it open, he called for one of the guards and relayed orders for them to begin setting up everything that'd be needed for a party, in the cafeteria. Because with a large sum of people there probably was one. Music, food, everything he had read about. Ironically he wasn't sure if he desired to partake, so training was good. As he looked to Ume he asked "Yuriko, do we need to go elsewhere for this training?"* - Sun Nov 22 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) (*Thirteen moved his hand to her head, as he lightly ran his fingers through it. "I've read something interesting,---And That sounds good."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded as he looked at her, he laid down the notebook as he spoke "Outside...Sounds good." He stated, as he stood, offering her his hand to help her up. "No need to get dressed, I'm assuming people are pre-occupied with the party." He stated lightly, he would've offered to carry her if he was stronger, but he wasn't so he had to deal.* - Sun Nov 22 11:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) had tottally forgotten about her light weight and even her reduced size. So he went to scoop her up in his arms, princess carry style. It made him feel good about himself, since he wasn't strong at all physically, being able to carry someone without strain told him that maybe he wasn't as weak as he thought, thank you for Ume, as he lifted her he continued walking through the base. Wondering what it was she had grabbed.* - Sun Nov 22 11:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, it was really an ego-booster, he should do this more often as he contemplated "Genjutsu would be ideal." He explained, with a nod of his head as he then spoke "Maybe non-elemental Ninjutsu as well." He stated, with a smile. As he slowly aimed to set her down as he contemplated his options.* - Sun Nov 22 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved to take a seat beside her as she asked him, he shook his head "I don't, It sounds pretty interesting though." He stated with a smile, he looked at the scrolls she had bought with her. And wondered if this 'Yosuke' , was a collector of sorts.* - Sun Nov 22 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at the scrolls, and finally his gaze fell to the interrogation genjutsu, he watched as Ume set it out. And with a light bow of the head in thanks, he began reading the scroll, taking a deep breath he focused on the lettering, within a moment he had taken in the style, as well as the slight characteristics in the person who wrote thr scroll's handwriting, taking a deep breath. As his eyes scanned over the scroll, he smiled briefly. He had already taken a firm grasp of the technqiue.

He knew Ume couldn't read, so scooting closer, he slid the scroll between the two of them, and read what was listed aloud. "This technique is used to break the will of a captured target, and to take as much information from a bound target as possible, but if the target has a strong will, this technique will not work upon them. This technique utilizes no handseals." He went on to explain several more things to her, making sure she understood before continuing.* - Sun Nov 22 11:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, as his hand rested on his back, as he spoke "That'd be a pretty interesting technique, we could use it on the scientists if we ever doubt what they're actually doing again." He explained, he scratched his cheek subtly, deciding he should probably go about mastering his techniques, but then again he also wondered if he should continue learning new things and work on mastering things later. But it seemed like Ume was doing alright. * - Sun Nov 22 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked the rest of the techniques present, which seemed to be a collaboration of high ranking technqiues, but after a moment, he scratched his cheek as he spoke: "Quite a few stick out, Chakra Enhanced Strength, Shadow Imitation, Shadow Clone Technique, Genjutsu Release, And Treebinding Death." He paused looking at her as he spoke "Any of those sound interesting to you?"* - Sun Nov 22 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Are any of them genjutsu? - Sun Nov 22 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Tree Binding Death, and Genjutsu Release. - Sun Nov 22 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I have Kai. - Sun Nov 22 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see, Do you wish to learn the other one then? - Sun Nov 22 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Sun Nov 22 12:13:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Maybe you learn it. - Sun Nov 22 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And I learn a element one. - Sun Nov 22 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) flips through the scroll, really quickly. His eyes scanning the text, as he contemplated what scroll he should give to Ume.  As he scratched his chin, he took a deep breath. This was definately a fairly basic technique, he didn't mind learning it at all, with a subtle yawn, he had a firm grasp over the technique, and he decided to rest another scroll between the two of them. It was the water Dragon technique, he had no intention of learning it but he did read it out to Ume. Along with it's Fourty Three Seals.* - Sun Nov 22 12:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: .....thats... - Sun Nov 22 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: A lot of seals. - Sun Nov 22 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yeah it is. - Sun Nov 22 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Uh...okay. - Sun Nov 22 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But I heard it's powerful. - Sun Nov 22 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, slowly he rested the scroll upon his lap, and began to slowly read the text which had been recorded upon the paper. With a subtle smile he began to read to himself :" The user first disappears from plain sight in a mist-like fashion in order to approach the target without being detected. "

"Once close enough, the target will then be completely robbed of their mobility as they see the mirage of a fast-growing tree coiling itself around them. Given that the subject remains conscious, this technique proves extremely efficient for information-gathering. Once the target is immobile, the user can then attack the enemy, usually after emerging from the trunk of the tree."

He nodded his head, this was definately intriguing, so he stood and cracked his knuckles and slowly he began practicing the seals for the technique known as Tree-Binding death, he was definately intrigued, him. But to learn this he'd have to improve some other form of combat to finish off his opponent, that was fine by his books.

He already had a few ideas of what he could do, to give himself an upper hand. But once he had a grasp of this technique, he set it down, and slowly he took a few deep breaths, he had decided or came to the deduction, Ume may've learned better from visual representation, so taking out a piece of paper, he began to sketch upon it. It wasn't the best pictures, but they got the information, it was in a flip book like format. With the handseals, and the development of the water dragon.

Sweeping away a stick-figure opponent.* - Sun Nov 22 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) clapped his hands, as he watched her form the water dragon. "That's amazing Ume, You did it." He stated with a smile on his face, it was truly exciting to see her accomplish something, the power and speed of that jutsu was nothing to be scoffed at.  And he knew Ume still had to master it, so he looked forward to the finished product.* - Sun Nov 22 13:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was more or less, happy because he was progression. Which was great, he chuckled at her question as he spoke "It's hard to explain, when I look at the words. It's like my brain absorbs them off the page, It's pretty interesting." He explained, as he rested beside he, he considered a few things as he spoke "What would you like to do now?" He asked, wondering if she potentially desired to begin working on her treatments again.* - Sun Nov 22 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I believe so, do you intend to? - Sun Nov 22 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: To continue that's. - Sun Nov 22 13:54:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What do you want to do? - Sun Nov 22 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: See you keep asking me what I want to do... - Sun Nov 22 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But the thing is. - Sun Nov 22 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't actually care. - Sun Nov 22 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The little emotions I'm gaining are on and off. - Sun Nov 22 14:00:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Keeping away? - Sun Nov 22 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Well...I don't really know what I'm keeping away. - Sun Nov 22 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you have certain questions? - Sun Nov 22 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You can't die, But can you use your powers on others? - Sun Nov 22 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...yes. - Sun Nov 22 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can heal you. - Sun Nov 22 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But I can't keep you from dying if you are dying. - Sun Nov 22 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Sun Nov 22 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: How does that work? - Sun Nov 22 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I tear off a piece of myself and put it into the wound. - Sun Nov 22 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But I can't stop illness I don't think. - Sun Nov 22 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Sun Nov 22 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: How fast does it work? - Sun Nov 22 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Depends how bad the wound, do you mean for me or for others? - Sun Nov 22 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Both. - Sun Nov 22 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: For me, if I'm 'killed' then it takes several hours... if I'm blown up... a few days. - Sun Nov 22 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: If it's just a normal wound that wouldn't kill someone then it takes a few minutes. - Sun Nov 22 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: For other's if they are seriously wounded it takes a few hours usually. - Sun Nov 22 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: To fully heal. - Sun Nov 22 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So you don't have to worry about getting hurt. - Sun Nov 22 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Sun Nov 22 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll have to be sure to keep you by my side then. - Sun Nov 22 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: What do you know about Sunagakure? - Sun Nov 22 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't like Suna.... - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The people were nice but the leader is mean. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I think I'll kill the leader then. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He only let me stay TWO DAYS?! - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He was so rude. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If you don't like him. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: He can die. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I warned him too. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I told him one day I would be useful but he didn't listen. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: If you want him dead. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm.. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moves over and climbs onto Ume, with his knees on either side of her legs, and his chest laying atop of her back. As he spoke "What did you do when you were in Sunagakure?" He asked, his chin atop of her head.* - Sun Nov 22 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: A Man? - Sun Nov 22 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 22 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He could -see- me. - Sun Nov 22 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He could see what I was I think. - Sun Nov 22 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And he touched me and apparently that was bad. - Sun Nov 22 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Because he knows seals. - Sun Nov 22 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: How did he touch you?---Seals? - Sun Nov 22 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And it was dangerous if he finds out what I am, but the way he looked at me seemed like he knew. - Sun Nov 22 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah he has 'fuuinjutsu' and he touched my cheek. But he was rubbing it a lot but when he touched me I copied him and he saw me activate the chakra. - Sun Nov 22 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And then he was looking at me.. -very- unnaturally. - Sun Nov 22 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Could you show me his form, Later? - Sun Nov 22 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 22 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'd like to have the scientists, continue building tunnels beneath the Villages, If that's alright with you. - Sun Nov 22 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 22 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm, have you been to any other villages? - Sun Nov 22 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Konoha. - Sun Nov 22 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Ame. - Sun Nov 22 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Kirigakure. - Sun Nov 22 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) sat up briefly, as he began to slowly remove his shirt. And toss it to the side, followed, by his boots. And finally his pants, though he did have his underwear on. And he rested back against her, closing his eyes, he took a deep breath "Which of those held the most interesting people?" He asked causally. His hands resting on her back for a moment. As his gaze shifted off to the side, looking at the water.* - Sun Nov 22 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The people in Suna just liked my skin.... - Sun Nov 22 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: They talked about it a lot. - Sun Nov 22 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: How white I was. - Sun Nov 22 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I guess because it's hot there I should have been burning they said. - Sun Nov 22 14:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) listened patiently, and nodded his head. And Ultimately he rolled off of her, looking towards the sky, briefly. As he repeated "Burning, Eh?" He asked, staring forward. He recalled her description of the man known as Sado. And how he spoke like a poet, as he asked "I see, Do you recall the 'Queen's' name?" He asked, as he slowly slipped out of his underwear, he felt a certain freedom. When he was in the nude. Though he was growing to dislike Sunagakure without having ever gone there himself. He motioned for her to move over towards him with his hand. As he listened to her speak. "What else did you enjoy about Amegakure?"* - Sun Nov 22 14:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes momentarily, as she moved to him, feeling her leg atop of his and her breasts against his side. He  smiled subtly, relaxing as her arm went across his chest. "Astero." He repeated, he wondered what kind of name that was and what origin it may have, but he figured he'd ask himself should he ever go to meet her. "Fun? That's a word, I don't hear you use often."  He joked, moving his arm around her with his hand upon her hip. As he spoke "Nature, I see. Maybe sometime we could visit there, It'd be nice to see it for myself." He admitted, as he contemplated all that she had said "Konoha, The Village hidden in the Leaves....It  must be like a party for you. All tose trees to speak with?"* - Sun Nov 22 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was also enjoying this, as he heard her speak, she seemed pretty normal to him. Not that he had anything to base it on in actuality. As he took a deep breath, he looked at her as he spoke "Weird plants? What'd it look like?" He asked curiously. As he asked "Wouldn't that make it fun by comparison, Yuriko~?" He asked with a gentle smile.Turning his head to look at her face as she laid on his shoulder.* - Sun Nov 22 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated what she said, as he spoke "They have thickened parts to retain water, In dry areas...If I recall correctly." He spoke, lightly,  as he remembered something "You never told me what you and the plants talk about." He stated, looking to her, he was very curious about what types of conversations she took part of.* - Sun Nov 22 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, as he looked at her face for a while longer, before he also closed his eyes as he spoke "So tell me...How is the sun today?" He asked, with a small smile on his face, this was pretty intriguing, he wondered what 'plant-things' were, before he met Ume he had never seen a plant let alone considered the possibility they could hold conversations.* - Sun Nov 22 15:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head he had a few good ideas, about what he could do. That ability to talk to plants was definately an interesting one. It had quite a lot of potential and as such he liked, it, his hand moved from her hip to her butt and rested there as he spoke "Hm, I was thinking within the next two days or so, Would you like to plant a garden? And I wonder what we can do to help them cool off."* - Sun Nov 22 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) opened a single eye that definately wasn't what he was expecting. But he smiled, "I see." He stated, as he spoke "I was thinking, we could start...Explorring...some of these labs..These notes stated there are more people like me trapped behind doors..." He stated lightly, as his hand gently rubbed over her butt, he was fairly relaxed, though a bit of tension could've been felt as his heart rate became more ferocious, as he mentioned the possibiltiy of others like himself.* - Sun Nov 22 16:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, "I think I'd like, that, But I'd like the rest of the day for just you and me. At least., a bit longer." He stated, with a smile. As he tightly grasped her butt, and held it for a moment. Before he spoke "I wonder how different you'll be when you've aquired all the emotions."* - Sun Nov 22 16:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he spoke "Maybe, You won't be as different as you think."  He considered the possibility of the experiments not working, but he already had a feeling that they would work, he was able to see the changes in her as well. As he spoke "I wonder if you'll still want to train me, Though I was hoping we could start doing it daily." He spoke lightly,  "I was thinking of having at least a hundred Guards learn that Barrier Canopy Method." He stated lightly, it'd make their defenses a lot better.* - Sun Nov 22 16:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) his left hand moved to grab her left leg, behind her knee, and pull it up until it was on his stomach, with his meat pressed against her calf region as he looked at her. And a truly mischievious grin appeared on his face. "You'd like that wouldn't you?" He spoke in a joking manner, he wondere if there was a technique he'd be able to teach Ume, and one popped into his mind but he wasn't sure if she'd be able to learn it.* - Sun Nov 22 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) couldn't help but notice how uncomfortable that position would've been to a normal girl, as he spoke "We'll just have to wait and find out~." He stated, with a smile, as his hand released her leg, allowing her to go back to a comfortable position, or drop back down to the way she was before. His gaze looked serious for a moment as a thought crossed his mind, but it immediately relaxed. As he spoke " I've been thinking about, Why I wish to train." He stated, as he suddenly aimed to roll over, attempting to push her onto her back, with him laying between her legs, keeping himself elevated some, as he stared into her eyes.* - Sun Nov 22 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared into her eyes, those mismatched eyes.  He really enjoyed looking at them, his left hand raised to her cheek briefly. Before moving to her lips, his index finger gently brushed over them. As he spoke "I want to, own this world...I want to see it -submit-, " He stated, a devilish grin appearing on his face, as he leaned in. Resting his forehead atop of her own. "I want to show this world, what it feels like to live in fear....Scared, not knowing if your next day will be your last." His left hand found her throat, just like it had those other times, but this time, the pressure was there. Not to choke her, but just as a testament to how anxious, the tension which was building up in his body. * - Sun Nov 22 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) couldn't help but chuckle, at her question. His eyes flared, out as he spoke, his tone was cold. "Yuriko-chan, you -are-, mine. You, are one I cherish, you're my prized possession. " He stated, his grip tightened some more, as his eyes shifted down to her lips. His tongue ran across his own, his heart was racing. His right hand moved to grasp one of her breasts. As he spoke "You....Are my doll, Yuriko. You are, something unique....Something beautiful---But...I don't wish to destroy you...I wish to see you grow. To show your true colors, like a flower which is waiting to blossom.."* - Sun Nov 22 17:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared into her eyes as he spoke "A doll, is a blank slate, one that is changed for their Master's needs. Dressed up, played with, for their Master's entertainment." He stated, as his grip on her throat maintained the same strength for a moment. Before lessening slightly, as his other hand, released her breast, and trailed down the side of her body. He was getting excited in more than one ways, this definate power trip he was having, it made him feel in -control-, and he loved it. His tone had changed to one, that was one of compassion, as his hand moved up to her cheek with a gentle caress. 

"You will never betray me Ume, and as such I will never try to harm you.(Not that I can),  I will cherish you, and As such I shall never betray you."* - Sun Nov 22 17:14:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled, as he spoke "Yes, Yuriko, Ume, whatever name you decide to go by or form you take, I am your owner. The only one who will be from this point on, Your one and only Master." He stated, as he stared down into her eyes, admiring the beauty of the form she had taken---Her beauty. As he spoke "You are mine, until the end of time." He stated, with a grin that can only be comparable to mischievious--Yet compassionate at the same time. * - Sun Nov 22 17:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared into her eyes, and he leaned forward. Placing his lips against her own, for the first time since they had met. As if a confirmation, of his ownership, his goal was to kiss her.  His erect phallus prodding against her pubic mound, as he aimed at completing this action. His grip on her throat tightened ever so subtly.* - Sun Nov 22 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt her returning the gesture, the softness creating a new and unique sensation. That he relished in, but probably to her surprise. He never pushed into her, as he rested himself somewhat atop of her, it rested, against her mound. After a while longer, he would've broken the kiss had she not, and stare into her eyes for a moment. Before rolling off of her and onto his back,  he was aroused. But he didn't wish to take advantage of her that much in her current state, although he knew she wouldn't care. As he looked towards the sky, he extended his arm for her to scoot closer as she had done before.  

"Ten years, In ten years time, I will enter the World of men for an extended period of time, to begin my crusade, but...I wish to begin preparing. To ensure my success in Ten years. Yuriko, I will change the world. With you at my side."* - Sun Nov 22 17:57:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly as she once again moved against him. He relaxed looking up into the expansive sky, as he spoke "This place, was never named before. Just an unknown base. Yosuke, he had this place built. His body, you never got it back, I'd like to allow you to put him to rest Ume. I'll retrieve his body, one way or another." He stated, with a warm smile. "And this place, I wish to name it 'Requiem'." He stated watchiung her face.* - Sun Nov 22 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head as he spoke "That's fine, I suppose...As long as it's with you, I don't think it matters who retrieves it. But I'll be there if you need my help." He wouldn't get mad, about this specific situation, he didn't see a reason to, he took a deep breath. "The money, that was left to you, What do you intend to do with it?"* - Sun Nov 22 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes briefly, he was enjoying this closeness with her, his arm moved around her, holding her close, as his hand rested on her back with gentle caressing motions. "I was thinking we could use it to buy up a few more businesses, It'll help with income." He suggested, with a smile.* - Sun Nov 22 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he spoke "Hospitals, Schools, and a few Restaurants, is What I was thinking." He stated lightly, his hand reaching back over to her butt, he seemed to enjoy touching so much. And gently groped it while keeping his eyes clothes. "It'd be a good investment, don't you think?"* - Sun Nov 22 19:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was contemplating taking her up on that, as he spoke "I'll get to that later, but for now....could you help me relieve some tension?" He asked his signature mischievious grin appearing back upon his face. As he looked down to his length, his gaze met hers again. He was curious as to what she'd do if given such a vague request. There was a lot he wanted to learn about Ume, not just sexually. But he was curious about her being as a whole.* - Sun Nov 22 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) pouted for a bit, it seemed like he had to explain. As he raised his free hand, and pointed at his cock. As he spoke "Could you help with the sexual 'relief', you spoke of yesterday?" He checked her expression, he seemed awefully relaxed, or maybe it was calm? He was seeing stuff in a different light, he finally saw the start line of the race, so all he had to do was cross it. But---Who's to say he couldn't have a bit of fun as he tried to begin?* - Sun Nov 22 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) scratched cheek as he spoke "I don't suppose, I could ask you to surprise me~?" He asked, before he had an interesting idea, "Why don't you....Use your butt to rub it?" He figured since he'd been spending several hours rubbing her butt with his hands, why not switch it up a bit. He wondered how she'd react, which he didn't believe he'd see any reaction.* - Sun Nov 22 19:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) pokes Ume.* - Sun Nov 22 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) pokes.* - Sun Nov 22 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) pokes.* - Sun Nov 22 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) keeps poking.* - Sun Nov 22 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm, Yeah. - Sun Nov 22 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Do you want to do a few more tests before we start looking through some of those rooms? - Sun Nov 22 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov 22 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Probably a good idea. - Sun Nov 22 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Are you going to do any? - Sun Nov 22 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm.. - Sun Nov 22 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I wouldn't know which ones to do? - Sun Nov 22 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moves to lift Ume up, before carrying her back to the base. Something told him, that this was going to be a hectic, next few days. Starting with these injections.* - Mon Nov 23 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) as they entered the room, he laid his doll down on the bed. And called for the Scientists, who had already prepared a variety of liquid 'doses', for the different emotions. Which were quickly wheeled in, "Do you know which ones you'd like to try first?" * - Mon Nov 23 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: OOMG - Mon Nov 23 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he scratched his cheek, looking at the vials which had been displayed before him. He figured he'd go with happiness, little to his knowledge, this one was a bit more tame, and wasn't designed to send her into hysterical laughter like last time. The effects were aimed at lasting, only for a few days, a week most. The scientist nodded, and uncorked the vial, offering it to Yuriko.* - Mon Nov 23 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) scratched his cheek, from the scientist's expression he was beginning to think this happened a lot. But he shook his head reaching for the next vial, which would make her experience a sense of 'uncomfortability', it was a dull colored liquid which was offered to her.* - Mon Nov 23 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched her reaction, as her thighs moved together, he blinked. "Yuriko?" He asked, a bit stunned by her reaction. "How so?" He asked questioning her statement, it was actually quite entertaining to see her acting like this.* - Mon Nov 23 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stood up as his gaze fell on the scientists, who were enjoying themselves. He looked towards one of the Guards, "Prepare them for Yuriko's meal." He stated, as the guard, walked over and attempted to grasp the scientists, who were having their fun, without a second glance Thirteen moved to grasp her blue dress, and offered it to her.   He couldn't help but find this attitude of hers to be entertaining. More feminine in nature, he assumed. He wondered how long it'd last.* - Mon Nov 23 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, as he moved to sit beside her,his hand found her hip and he subtly rubbed her hip in a comforting way. "Yuriko, it's alright." He stated, with a tilt of his head the scientists were told to wait outside. He looked at her, as he took a deep breath, recalling the name of the vial he spoke "You have nothing to be ashamed about, you're perfect. You're my beautiful, Doll, Yuriko."* - Mon Nov 23 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "Most people from what I've seen feel self-concious about their bodies. It's a weird emotion I don't quite understand myself." And he moved to lay on his side, looking at her, as she whispered to him, he closed his eyes his hand finding her cheek. "And I like it when you're doing things you enjoy. If you want to be naked, I want to see you naked.(That probably wouldn't work on anyone besides Ume.) Even if, you don't desire to be naked in public, when it's just us...You don't need to feel ashamed. You're a flawless beauty."* - Mon Nov 23 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled warmly, as he watched her remove the dress. His gaze was soft, and gentle. And when she moved to curl beside him, his arm would move to wrap around her. His hand finding her back, and rested there. As he spoke "I truly love looking at your eyes." He admitted in  alow tone, "Your hair is unique, and its like every time I see you, it is the first time I've set my gaze on you. That wonderful sensation repeats itself every morning." He knew when to be forceful, but he also knew when to be kind.* - Mon Nov 23 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes as she rested her face against his chest, she'd easily be able to hear and feel the beating of his heart inside his chest. His hand, moved up and down her bare back. As he spoke "Am I~? It's hard not to tell you how I feel about you. Just being in the same room, beside you in moments like this. Makes me experience a happiness, and excitement I won't find anywhere else. My precious Yuriko." He stated, he was really learning, alongside Yuriko, her change in emotions made him want to adapt to keep the situation under his control...Adapting...And learning. It never did cease with him.* - Mon Nov 23 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) leaned forward to kiss her on her forehead. "For you, I'll endure. I don't mind these feelings, not when it comes to you." He stated, as he spoke "Get dressed, Yuriko. We have some people to meet."* - Mon Nov 23 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "I wanted to see,  if you actually believed my words. Or were just going along with them. You don't have to get dressed, but if you feel the need to because you're uncomfortable. You may." When he stood, he arched his arm outwards, as if telling her to grasp it as he spoke "On that note, shall we go?"* - Mon Nov 23 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) lead her into the public area, as he told one of the Guards to have everyone in the base meet in the Cafeteria. He had called a meeting as he spoke "It's about time, we tell them how things will be going from this point on." He stated with a smile, as he interlocked his fingers with her own, heading to the center of the cafeteria, where there was a raised platform.* - Mon Nov 23 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: W- - Mon Nov 23 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He didn't tell me that everyone is going to be here. - Mon Nov 23 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Yuriko, if you get nervous, you can lean on me. Stand behind me or beside me, It's your choice. But I'm here for you, zone out the rest of them. - Mon Nov 23 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked back at her as he smiled lightly, offering her his top shirt. Which was white, with a gold trimming on it. Probably fairly big on her,  "If you want to, you can use this." He stated, still holding onto her hand, he still had a black long sleeve shirt, with cargo-like pants on with boots. As he continued to the raised stand, he turned to address the people. Not once letting go of Yuriko's hand, he wanted her to believe in him. 

His eyes scanned the crowd as he spoke "People...of Requiem, Guards, Scientists, those who all help this base continue on.  For those who do not know, My Name is Thirteen, and the woman beside me. Her name is Yuriko, she is your Leader." There were probably nearly Four thousand people present. And that's why he specifically offered Yuriko his shirt to cover up if she wanted to. He didn't want her having a panic attack.* - Mon Nov 23 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) spotted the one male who was still standing and briefly his gaze rested upon him. As he opened his mouth once again "This place...No...this home of ours...Is going to go through some drastic changes. The two of us, our orders...They will be absolute. The scientists, all projects and experiments will be run through us, from this point on." He paused briefly, maybe he was getting ahead of himself as he spoke:

"I hope this relationship, will be a long and thriving one. We wish to protect our way of life, and make it bearable..If not enjoyable for all of us. But there is one threat on the horizon...It is...the outside world. And for that sake, we will be taking measures against them, to protect ourselves....From this point on, we'll be entering an extended period of lockdown. There will be no travels off of this island, no male shall be received nor sent out." 

He explained, his voice echoing through the area. His hazel gaze explored the crowd. * - Mon Nov 23 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) eyes scanned the troops and faculity once again. As he took a deep breath. "Over these next couple of weeks, I will be setting into place a Chain of Command, Three generals will be created. They will have the highest level of authority, besides me and Yuriko. During this period of lockdown, one thing must be known. Any attempt to leave this island or send word out, will be punished severly. By Death."

No doubt there were a few gasps, and a few looks: "One message to the outside world, could mean the death of everyone within this place. These people...They are your family. And those who betray their family, don't deserve to live." He inhaled briefly, before he continued.

"Several projects are being placed into motion, the first of which the construction project of the late Yosuke. To build an interconnected tunnel system beneath all of the Ninja Villages. The time span in which this will take has been raised to ten full years, to avoid detection."

He took another break before he added "In the lower sect. There will also be an area designated, to training the Children, for one of the trades needed for this place to survive. Agriculture, Scientists, Guards, and engineers, will be a priority for the comming years."* - Mon Nov 23 02:22:04 2015
