He'd slowly grasp one of her feet, his hands were soft, and gentle, as he began to apply a bit of pressure, beginning to massage her feet, aiming to make her more comfortable.

"I see that's good then, I've also had the pleasure of meeting the new Mizukage. He uses a Gunbai,  doesn't seem to be a skilled fighter and prefers to hide behind his soldiers, their jounin seems to be quite lazy---She didn't even assist when a monstrous beast was attacking the Village, she just watched. Their army is fairly small as well, even smaller after the fight."

He paused for a bit as he spoke "I suppose you'd like to see the gift I got you?" He said looking up to her with a gentle smile. Before his gaze returned to her feet, and his thumbs began to massage her heel ever so gentle.* - Sun Nov 15 23:54:01 2015

As he reached into his pocket, taking out a small piece of paper with strange writing, without moving from the couch, he laid it on the ground, and ran a finger over the seal. And it erupted, and ----Ten Million Yen had been summoned stacks upon stacks of money were piled along side them on the floor. And slowly he moved to continue his job of massaging her feet.

"I hope you like your gift, My Queen." 

He smiled once again before a single hand reached to grasp his own glass of sake, raising it to his lips. He'd take a sip of the glass, before setting it down. Now working on massaging the arch of her foot.* - Mon Nov 16 00:10:14 2015

"I haven't been sitting on my butt in a bar for this entire time, I've been working and calling in favors." He stated with a warm smile.

"I trust you enjoy your gift?"* - Mon Nov 16 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked as he briefly recalled asking her to play, but of course he ceased his actions. "Of course my Lady." He stated with a nod of his head, reaching for her shoes. He'd aim to slowly put them on, aligning them with her foot, he'd take care to strap, tie, or fit them on appropriately depending on what kind of shoes she was wearing before he'd stand up ,taking a sip of his glass of sake. "Shall I carry you, My Queen?" He asked with a subtle smile.* - Mon Nov 16 00:47:47 2015

"I will accept all of you Ume, I don't mind."* - Mon Nov 16 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked he had definately did a double take, he was stunned as he saw her taking in his body. He swallowed hard, as his gaze remained focused on the process, until it was done. And it was definately interesting, he watched her tongue lick over her lips. And didn't say anything for a while.."Wow."* - Mon Nov 16 02:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was definately a bit taken back, but he shook his head, approaching her he simply spoke "Yeah...I'm fine." He stated, giving her a smile. "Are you still hungry?" He asked, he wasn't sure how her diet went, or if one body was filling or not.* - Mon Nov 16 02:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head, it'd definately take a moment to get used to, "I see.." He nodded his head, before attempting to grasp her hand.. "Where...would you like to go..?" He wondered if she cared about walking around naked---But he knew she didn't he wondered if he should join her, but he'd definately be embarrassed.* - Mon Nov 16 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) contemplated it as he realised they've spent a lot of time in both the water, and in the room. Ultimately he decided on the room as he asked "Hey do you think you can give me a massage?"* - Mon Nov 16 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) led her back to the room, as he slowly began to undress, removing his shirt, and pants followed by boxers. Exposing himself to Ume, as he spoke "Hey...Would you mind if I shared this room with you....?" He asked, as he moved to go and sit on the bed. Wondering if she'd direct him on how she wanted him to sit.* - Mon Nov 16 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) smiled briefly, as he looked at her "I see, than that's good." Before he laid back on the matress he simply replied "Why not have everything massaged~?" He asked staring back at her for a reaction.* - Mon Nov 16 03:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was probably all of those things, he never called himself a good person but if he stopped to think about it he'd definately feel bad. He closed his eyes as she began to massage his foot, inhaling followed by a deep exhale. He began to relax, her soft and gentle touch was working wonders. He had never gotten a full-body massage before, hell Ume was the first person to give him any type of massage anyway.* - Mon Nov 16 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) kept his eyes closed for the most part, as he spoke "Tomorrow most likely, And the day after...You think you'd like to begin training with me?" He asked opening his eyes for a moment to watch her reaction to his question.* - Mon Nov 16 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her as she massaged his leg, it was fairly relaxing, but he blinked when she passed over something that caused him some pain? He looked towards, her and his leg pulled back "O-Ow....I'm not sure.." He muttered, maybe he wasn't thinking straight,  he might've known what it was.* - Mon Nov 16 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) relaxed a bit as she continued moving up his body. Watching her as he spoke "Your touch feels so nice, Soft....Gentle. I love it." He commented, leeping his eyes closed.* - Mon Nov 16 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) contemplated it as he spoke "H-Hm....I want you too...But...It's u-up to you i-if you do it...I mean It probably...would cause a problem.." He admitted,giving her a fair warning as his cheeks turned a faint shade of pink and his gaze was averted.* - Mon Nov 16 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) didn't seem to mind it currently, he released a subtle gasp as her hands moved up his sides and his chest. Wondering if the massage was comming to an end, he was fairly relaxed now.  He was really enjoying this, and his eyes opened to look at Ume, as he remained pretty still except for the occasional stretching of a limb as tension was released. "Did you ever name this form of yours?" He asked curiously.* - Mon Nov 16 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked as she spoke,  "Y-You'd let me have that honor?" He asked genuinely flattered, as he smiled subtly, she'd probably feel that he was developing some muscle tone over the last few weeks.  He was in fact truly happy, that she had even considered him for such a role. * - Mon Nov 16 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) contemplated her question, as he stared her in the eyes feeling the firmness of their hands together. As he opened his mouth, he spoke "Ozawa, Chihiro..." Looking into her eyes for signs of dissapproval, that was the first name that came to mind.* - Mon Nov 16 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) thinks: A Thousand Questions. - Mon Nov 16 05:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) gasped, subtly as she began massaging his back, he bit his bottom lip.  "Man...That feels great." He muttered, simply enjoying the feeling of her massages.* - Mon Nov 16 05:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) woke up on the bed, feeling fully refreshed. As he stretched for a bit before sitting up, he probably fell to sleep after the massage so he was probably still naked. "Morning, Um---Chihiro-chan."* - Tue Nov 17 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) smiled as he looked up to her, sliding closer, he also moved down some. Attempting to rest his head against her chest as he spoke:
 "I like you being the first thing I see when I wake up."* - Tue Nov 17 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) closed his eyes, just enjoying the feeling of her soft flesh against his own.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Tue Nov 17 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) sits up and moves to give her a kiss on the cheek. Before he stood from the bed, and proceeded to pull on his underwear and pants. Before heading to the door, with a quick shout, shuffling around could be heard. And after about two minutes, a doctor entered the room. Wheeling in a cart, which seemed to have several different things on them. "Hello Ume-san." The doctor spoke, setting up stuff over in one of the corners.* - Tue Nov 17 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||Nodded her head before proceeding to check all of the vials to make sure there were in fact no surprises "None.." She stated, but this time instead of an injection, there was a liquid substance that was offered to Chihiro "Drink it." The doctor stated lightly "This one will stimulate the reaction known as anger." She stated, this time Ryutaro moved closer in case he'd have to stop her from killing a doctor.* - Tue Nov 17 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozawa, Chihiro(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Tue Nov 17 02:35:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) contemplated it as he replied "You're fine, drink up." He stated offering her a smile, as his hand rested on her thigh. He nodded to the doctor, and waited to see if this would work.* - Tue Nov 17 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) contemplated what she said as he shook his head "It probably is a dud...Let's move on." He stated, motioning for the scientist, he was a bit annoyed by their failure, but she offered her a pink viel as she explained. "Love." Offering it to her.* - Tue Nov 17 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked as he saw the look in her eyes and his heart skipped a beat. He extended his hand to meet her own, and he noticed her body going pink. He wondered if that was her body's way of a 'blush', but he wasn't to sure. He glanced towards the doctor, wondering if this was alright, and she simply motioned for him to play along until the medicine had worn off, they were practicing with longer lasting, and more potent medicines now. Especially if they were to be permanent.* - Tue Nov 17 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) wasn't resisting so he was pulled to her, and felt her nuzzling against him vaguely taken note in he change of color. Which he wasn't sure was neccessarilly a problem, and when she tried to kiss him, he allowed her to and kissed back. He also didn't care much for the scientist watching, who had developed a slight blush as she wrote notes..* - Tue Nov 17 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) had been taken by her kiss, and once she broke it he panted lightly. Feeling the slight flutter of her lips against his own as she spoke "Y-You....love m-me?" He muttered, in almost disbelief. He had never felt like he'd hear her utter those words to him, and the surprise showed on his face, he hadn't even put together it was probably due to the medication she was just given..* - Tue Nov 17 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was seriously taken by her words, if they didn't take him off guard he probably wouldn't have been as in to it as he was. The feeling of her lips against his own excited him, and especially when she rubbed her body against him, he was definately getting aroused. "I....love you to Chihiro."* - Tue Nov 17 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) smiled as he spoke "Yeah...My Chihiro." He stated, as she kissed him again, and one of his hands found her hip. Gently moving up and down, as he held the kiss with her, even moving to guide his tongue into her mouth as they kissed---He was definately getting into it.* - Tue Nov 17 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) felt her soft tongue against his own which caused a faint blush on his part, as her arm wrapped around his torso. He felt his body drawn closer to her own, and she'd probably feel his manhood getting harder against her as the kissing session continued. His heart was racing, and he was still shirtless, so she may be able to feel his body heating up. At this point he had practically zoned out the scientist, and was concentrating solely on Chihiro.* - Tue Nov 17 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was definately being put in a mood as her kissing became more intimate, his hands trailed down her sides, and legs before finding their home behind her knees, aiming to guide her legs up to around the height of his waist as he continued kissing her. He was in love with Chihiro, he didn't care about anything else and his troubles seemed to just melt away. He wanted to get closer to her, feel every part of her, explore every crevice. * - Tue Nov 17 04:01:04 2015
