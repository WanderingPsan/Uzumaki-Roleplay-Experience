<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) had decided to take her advice on what to wear from a previous discussion, and as such he walked back out in the white shirt, with a purple sash completed with black pants and boots.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah.. - Fri Oct 23 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) figured if Katsune was investing time into teaching him how to utilize a technique efficiently, he figured he'd need to completely pay attention to what it was she was showing. And as such, he paid attention when she formed the snake seal, he nodded his head, taking notice of how extroadinary that snake seal actually was. And he took a deep breath inhaling followed by a dep exhale.

He watched as the spores began to propagate at her feet, and blinked, it was definately an interesting technqiue. And he was surprised it was D ranked, He was definately anticipating it to be Ranked C but he figured there was some fatal flaw, he must've missed, but he watched as it raced across the sandy ground, soaking the sand and bringing it into it's mix.

He blinked, as he listened to the sounds. And smiled to himself, taking note of the variations she showed with the distance of the technique, since she had used it against him twice now, he knew how it felt to be on the receiving end of this technique, but he appreciated the time she was taking to show him each step and nodded his head.

He once again watched the spores beginning to form in a slow state, propagating to the point in which they began to join together to form a wave of mud, he nodded his head, cracking his knuckles as he spoke "Well...Here goes nothing." And slowly he began practicing the seal, mostly attempting to work on the quick-draw factor, aiming to make sure, he was able to think of the seal on the run.

After a few moments, he smiled before makng the seal as he began to concentrate his chakra, causing spores to begin to form before his body, but that was all that occured, they formed, his execution of the technique had some flaw somewhere, so he decided to take a deep breath and sigh. Inhaling through his nostrils, and exhaling through his mouth. He cracked his knuckles before bracing himself.

His hands raised he began to make the seal once again, this time focusing on properly balancing his chakra, the spores began to form before him, before joining together, and shooting forth as a stream of mud not as large as Katsune's own, spread out before him. He smiled lightly "I think I got it." He stated looking to Katsune.* - Fri Oct 23 03:32:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would slowly approach Katsune, and if permitted his hands would find her shoulders before he'd lean in. Aiming to plant a kiss on one of her cheeks, though still embarrassed, he attempted it should she permit it.* - Fri Oct 23 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as he watched her turn away, he was also showing signs of embarrassment. "Have fun, I'll...See you later Kat." He stated, looking at the ground, as he smiled a bit, before he turned to head into the house where he'd find his bed and fall asleep. "Man...She's cute."* - Fri Oct 23 03:40:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sets her down for a bit as he shot her a glance as he simply stated "It leaves me less vulnerable." He stated, quite an odd remark , as he slowly moved over to the kitchen, which was probably close enough to hold a conversation. Slowly he began preparing the same dish from before, which was Sake Nigiri, which was Sushi, Sea-weed and cavier with a sea-weed wrap. After preparing the dish, which wasn't time consuming at all. He bought it to Asteroth, he was surprised she said 'we eat', so he prepared himself some as well as he spoke "Would you like Water, tea, or Wine? M'Lady."* - Sat Oct 24 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) shook his head as he spoke "Not at all, M'Lady. It's mutually beneficial, Becuase I learn about the other Villages, and get to know their Shinobi. So should anything go wrong, We'll be prepared with information." He stated lightly, as he approached the counter, he began fixing her some tea, making sure it was hot as he prepared it. Adding a bit of honey, just to sweeten it and get rid of the bitter-ness, at least so it wasn't overpowering. At the same token not to sweet, as he bought it back to her, he rested it upon the table.

Fetching himself a glass of water, as he sat down.* - Sat Oct 24 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) slowly began to feast himself, and after swallowing he spoke "I've noticed that most villages are to, trusting for their own good. Few questioned why a strange male approached their gates, and all of them ended up assisting me in training some way. I've went a round with the Kazekage's Grandson, and been trained by his daughter. They're pretty interesting, But I always kept to using one or two specific techniques when fighting as to not give them an advantage, not a big one at least."* - Sat Oct 24 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head "I actually planned to leave this night, So a message might be fairly easy.

He stated, looking towards her as he finished his Sushi.* - Sat Oct 24 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looks to her as she spoke, and he blinked subtly surprised by her 'handle him accordingly', But he didn't say much, but he nodded his head as he spoke "There's always swimming, And if you didn't mind...Conversations with you tend to be enjoyable." He added, as he wiped his lips as well, looking away slighly. His napkin laid atop of his plate, and he prepared to go wash the fishes once she was done.

"Though, cooking for you, and giving you a foot massage, is always enjoyable--At least seeing you comfortable and happy." He stated, scratching his cheek out of embarrassment.* - Sat Oct 24 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinkd a tad bit surprised by her words, there was a light reddening of his cheeks, as he took her plate, before cleaning it off before he began washing it. Taking his time, to make sure that it was blemish free, after a moment he nodded his head "Yeah, and I-I'm looking f-forward to next time.." He stated, before realising what he stated, "S-Sorry for that." Apologizing for saying something so upfront, before he headed to the door.* - Sat Oct 24 01:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) noticed Koji approaching via the technique in use, and simply sighed, he didn't intend to be hit. and if he was hit, he'd probably be thrown back into the contestants behind him. But he was curious as to how Koji detected him, he thought his timing was well, but that was fine, his plan to get it off before Koji's ability set in had apparently failed. But regardless, he attempted to fall off to the side. Or rather raise his hand, once he noticed Koji's movements, still not saying anything.

But he felt it'd be easier if he accepted his failure, and walked away instead of being knocked into the other test takers, not to mention he didn't desire to get hit. He was already higher ranking than everyone present, save for Muhhamed, so he didn't mind.* - Sat Oct 24 01:41:07 2015
