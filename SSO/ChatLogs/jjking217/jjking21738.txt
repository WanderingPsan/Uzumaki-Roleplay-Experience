<br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved to take a seat beside Yuriko, "We need to talk."* - Mon Nov 30 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took a deep breath, as he spoke "Yesteday, Explain why you  opposed me?" He asked looking to her he wasn't sure if he was going to punish her just yet, Her answer would make the decision for him.* - Mon Nov 30 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) relaxed in his chair "And you believe,I lost control? How so?" He asked curiously.* - Mon Nov 30 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You were stripping all the power away from me because you felt threatened by me wanting to learn to read and to take control over that I rightfully own, this base and the money. - Mon Nov 30 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You tried to control when and how long I can leave the base for. - Mon Nov 30 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Mon Nov 30 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Understood. - Mon Nov 30 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stood from his chair "Do what it is, you desire." He stated, pushing his chair in. He took a deep breath, this was a power struggle...And she proved for a moment she was in control. He disliked that, in this specific manner, but he turned and began heading towards their room, after he had cleared the distance so he wasn't in her perhipherals. His hands would've moved together making a single handeal.* - Mon Nov 30 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled subtly, as the technique was completed she'd see the world before her blur, and fatigue beginning to set in. Perhaps, making her fall off of the chair, he turned to face her, as it set into place, he said nothing just watched and observed her form. This was going to be enjoyable, she may've been right, and it was hard to argue with her reasoning as to why he was wrong...But even so he felt the need to punish her.* - Mon Nov 30 20:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved over to her body once she hit the ground and slowly he aimed to lift her and hoist her over his shoulder while maintaining the genjutsu. He had purposefully warped the effects to fatigue instead of quick-sand, so she wouldn't be able to identify his previous use. Had he managed to grasp her, he'd begin carrying her into their room. In which case the door was locked, as she was placed down on the center of the floor. And he crouched, and began undoing the straps of her dress, to pull it off. Followed by removing her shoes, and then underclothes, leaving her naked on the floor. Afterwards He'd release his first genjutsu, and at the same token he'd make another seal, casting another. She'd probably notice a swirling of dust  around her eyes. After said trigger was casted, she'd find herself chained to a pole in a dark room. Bound by her arms and legs.* - Mon Nov 30 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared back at her, as he seemed to be the only thing within the darkness, he walked around her until he was behind her. And he sent his hand forward, with a swat at her ass, and she'd probably be able to feel the stinging pain of his hand on her rear. "You see Yuriko, I do....Have to punish you though.You defied me, and told me no. Even when I gave you a chance to plead your case later....You continued to go against my wishes...My doll can't be...That selfish." Suddenly he'd begin to blend into the darkness. "When you've had enough, You know what to say." He stated, as a light seemed to shine down upon her from above, subtle whispers could be heard. Increasing in intensity, so that it sounded like hundreds of people were in the room. But still it was dark, besides for the one light that shined over her. If she looked at the ground in front of her, there was a mirror, which captured her nude form, bound and tied.* - Mon Nov 30 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched her trembling, as he walked around her body although she couldn't see him,,His hand was extended, it went across her lips, her jaw, down her neck, over her breast. And across her side, his touch would feel warm against her flesh. "You know what to say, Yuriko~." He spoke, but it was like a ghostly whisper, and another light shot on, and another Mirror appeared, then another and another. All around her from every angle, giving her a look at her rear, and sex, her breasts, he face, and her entire nude form no matter where she looked. The whispering intensified, followed by awed gasps. As he made his way behind her, and his 'ghostly' hand, brushed over her sex. She'd experience a sensation akin to 'pleasure'.  Before another swat was delivered to her ass. The shackles on her hands and legs tightened, adding some more pain into the mix.* - Mon Nov 30 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was enjoying this oh so very much, his finger tip brushed over her asshole, and it was as cold as ice. Out of one of the mirrors, a figure began to rise a dark...distorted silhoutte, which groaned and moaned. Slowly...approaching her it staggered towards her. The mirrors had oddly all began to show the image of her front, perfectly from each angle. Even the mirrors which lay behind her, "Are you...Scared,  Yuriko-chan~?" Thirteen's voice radiated through the mirror'd room. As the chains began to tug on her person, pulling her to an upright position, with her arms extended out to the side, and her legs spread almost as if  as an offering to the distorted shadow approaching her. From behind she'd feel Thirteen's hands on her side, one icly, one warm moving along her curves and over her breasts. * - Mon Nov 30 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as he reacher around from behind her, his body was pressed against hers from behind, and his arm moved beneath her bound one. And moved up, until the hot hand grasped her neck. The other one, moved around lower, and rested over her pubic mound. As his form appeared, he leaned forward. "Do you...Want me...To stop~?" He asked, before moving to kiss her neck, "Then you know...What to say, Yuriko~." The figure continued approaching and would reach her within Fifteen seconds.* - Mon Nov 30 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: \ - Mon Nov 30 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) held her in this position, his hand didn't move from her sex, nor from her throat as he stared at the shadowy figure. "I see....Then it seems like someone is....ready to meet you~." The shadowy figure now stood before Yuriko, it's moan and groans louder, a dense heat radiated from it's form, as its hand was extended to her face, and time seemed to slow down drastically. Besides her, the figure's clawed hand approached her. As he spoke "You know, what to say." Was echoed through the area.* - Mon Nov 30 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched as she struggled and the hand was centimeters from touching her. He decided to guide her. "I love you, My Precious Yuriko." He stated as the figure's hand drew closer, it'd practically feel as if it was burning the flesh over her chest where it's hand neared. This would perhaps be her final chance "Maybe I put to much faith in her." He thought to himself.* - Mon Nov 30 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) gave her neck a kiss, she hadn't figured it out. But even so...His doll would have a lot more time to figure it out, if she tested him again...He intended to break her, he was fine with putting her back together piece by piece...She was his special doll afterall. Time sped up, and the figure---Had transformed, the scenary changed, they were all at a lake. Green scenary, trees, wide blue sky, and the figure before her hand transformed into an exact replica of Yuriko, the heat radiating from her form had dissappeared as the replica placed her hand on Yuriko's chest. Leaning in it'd bite her earlobe lightly before blowing, the chills could easily be felt. "If you only listened, and obeyed, Master, never gave him reason to doubt us.. It'd be perfect, Our lives would be...So much happier! But there's still time...We can be....his ideal doll! Serve him, until we're back in his favor~." The replica spoke, before leaning in, she'd place her lips against Yuriko's own, a light peck on the lips, followed by biting on the original's bottom lip.

"Well, that's up to you~." She stated. Before her body began to whiter away, like leaves, being dispersed by the breeze. Leaving the two of them alone, she was unshackled, and Thirteen held her form against his own. In the same manner, she'd no longer feel burning heat, or piercing cold. Just a welcomming warmth from his body.* - Mon Nov 30 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt her shaking in his arms, but he held onto her, he bit down on her neck as if telling her to stop trying to run. She'd very much feel the pain from his teeth, as they pressed into her but not breaking her skin. "Stay still, Yuriko...Or this wonderland...Can become your hell." He warned, as the hand which rested between her legs, drove a single finger into her. "Stay still, Yuriko."* - Mon Nov 30 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: As he stuck a finger in, She'd probably feel an intense tingling+Warmth radiating through her body. ** - Mon Nov 30 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ran his tongue across his lips, as he felt her go lax. Even though he took notice that she was almost....Lifeless, the intensisty of the genjutsu died down. Only maintaining this utopia around her, slowly lowered himself into a sitting position, and pulled her onto his lap. Pulling his finger out of her sex. He'd hold her gently. "My...beautiful Yuriko...It'll be fun...Shaping you once again...Into my -perfect- parthner." He stated, combing his fingers through her hair, "Mm....I wonder, if you'll remember...The taste of human flesh....I hope not....I wish to see, the look on your face as your virgin tongue tastes it once again...A bit of ambrosia...It'll be..beautiful."* - Mon Nov 30 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Silly virgin tongue - Mon Nov 30 23:46:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) kissed her neck gently from behind, as he spoke "Yuriko, You're mine...In body and in soul. Can you, grace me with a look...Into your beautiful eyes?" He asked leaning to give her another kiss on the back of her shoulder. Allowing her to experience the sensations still as if she was human.* - Mon Nov 30 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Grace. - Mon Nov 30 23:51:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: So many eyes. - Mon Nov 30 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: So many mirrors. - Mon Nov 30 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Crack.... cut... break...shatter... break the mirrors... make them bleed. - Mon Nov 30 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked into her eyes, as he spoke "Beautiful...." He spoke, as his gaze looked down her back. "Stand up, Yuriko." He stated, wondering if she'd follow through, He hoped he hadn't broken her too bad...But he wouldn't mind re-educating her.* - Mon Nov 30 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Break break...broken.. mirrors.... break heheh...broken mirrors. - Mon Nov 30 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head as he saw her move, or attempt to "That's good,  Do you remember what keeps, your Master happy?" He asked, as his hands wrapped around her slowly, resting on her hips. As he rested his chin on her shoulders, holding her warmly in his embrace. Feeling her soft skin against his finger tips, his tongue moved over his lips.* - Tue Dec  1 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiiled as he spoke "Close....I enjoy...That look in your eyes after you eat...When you pleasure me, and take charge of things, Mm....When you kiss me and hug me. When we train together...But my happiness...Is -your- happiness...Yuriko...You will never betray me." He stated, kisisng her neck gently.* - Tue Dec  1 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "Mm...Like in your stories~ But...Some of those stories we should make into reality." He partially wondered if her training was undone, he hoped it wasn't but he was curious about this new personality, it seemed hyper. But it was interesting he wondered how it'd go.* - Tue Dec  1 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as she gasped and he saw that wide smile.."Mhm...Pretend~.." He stated. "I'm glad you like playing pretend~." His hands moved up to her breast, lightly cupping them both. " I wonder~, Which story should we play pretend to~?"* - Tue Dec  1 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as he spoke "Mm, Let's try a bit of all of them...Where you play your part using all of your bod~?" HE spoke, looking towards her, he wondered where she'd take this if given the reigns.* - Tue Dec  1 00:41:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked as he spoke "Sure, let's play a little first...I'll let you decide which one of the stories we do though."Mirrors?" He thought to himself, he didn't have a problem with her breaking them he was just curious as to why. He'd be sure to ask, though he wondered if she'd break mirrors while she ate. That'd be interesting to see, Multi-tasking.* - Tue Dec  1 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, as he spoke "That's fine then~." He wondered if she could stand, but he wondered if she'd be willing to feel good for once. As he spoke "Sit in front of me." Once she did if she was able to, he'd stand, he'd move to help her, down if she wasn't able to. "Maybe we won't follow the script...One hundred percent." He stated, beginning to undo his shirt, followed by his pants and after that his underwear as he stood in front of her.* - Tue Dec  1 00:50:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, as he contemplated it "You stated, you want to break mirrors? Why, Yuriko-chan?" He asked curiously as his gaze settled upon her.* - Tue Dec  1 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched as her smile faded "You don't have to tell me, we can go break mirrors, Yuriko." He stated looking towards her, as he'd aim to lift her as he stood. And the Genjutsu faded completely and they were in their room. And there was of course, a mirror in the bathroom. So he carried her towards the bathroom.* - Tue Dec  1 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stopped in his tracks, "What's wrong, Yuriko?" He asked, holding her gently. His gaze settled on her person as her face rested against his chest.* - Tue Dec  1 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Can you go smash it for me? - Tue Dec  1 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her he wondered if it was some kind of trauma, but he exited the bathroom, and  his gaze fell on her. As he moved to set her down at the ground, he looked at her. "You sure you don't want the pleasure of doing so?" He asked as he studied her eyes.* - Tue Dec  1 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, as he nodded taking a deep breath, as he ented the bathroom. He figured one smooth thing would be efficient, so he moved to grab the miniature trashcan that was in their bathroom, and picking it up, he suddenly threw it forward at the mirror. And when it hit, the sound of glass shattering and hitting the floor could've been heard. "Trauma, Maybe my genjutsu...went overboard?" He thought to himself, as the sound of the trashcan hitting the ground could be heard throughout their room. "There...It's destroyed." He'd stated, looking towards her as he crouched before her on the floor offering her his hand. * - Tue Dec  1 01:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked, as he spoke "M-Meat lolipop?" But he nodded his head, and moved to the door he whispered something and the guard ran off to relay her order. "It'll be a few minutes, Would you like to go for a swim...? Or check on your garden in the meantime?"* - Tue Dec  1 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Garden? - Tue Dec  1 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What garden? - Tue Dec  1 21:30:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: How about this... - Tue Dec  1 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Only focus on the -happy- parts of your stories. - Tue Dec  1 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Interesting...Not the bad parts. - Tue Dec  1 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: O-oh... - Tue Dec  1 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I guess we can go to a garden. - Tue Dec  1 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) would stand while still holding her hand, "Let's go...Princess Yuriko~." He stated lightly, moving to kiss the back of her hand.* - Tue Dec  1 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled  he was enjoying this personality for the time being, as he'd slowly kneel, before lifting her off of her feet. "Now...What was I thinking, A Beautiful princess doesn't have to walk~!" He estated, beginning to carry her off to the garden.* - Tue Dec  1 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ||Watched as some of them actually kneeled, but once he arrivved at the Garden, he pushed open the door before locking it behind him. "Approaching one of the chairs, he'd set her down in it, "How do you like it~?" He asked, some of the plants had begun to grow, especially the succulents.* - Tue Dec  1 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as she spoke "Yeah, I thought you may like it~." He stated, moving to stand against the wall. Leaning, as he turned to her. "Hm~? Something wrong, Yuriko?"* - Tue Dec  1 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her "You can hear the voices of plants...Don't you remember Princess~?" He stated looking towards her curiously. "Memory loss?" He wondered.* - Tue Dec  1 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I thought that was my story? - Tue Dec  1 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) noticed this, and walked over to her, as he moved to lift her up in his arms and exit the room. "Maybe.. This can wait...I was thinking...We could look at some books before going to meer a new person or two...How does that sound?" He asked as he left the room.* - Tue Dec  1 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) carried her back to their room, and laid her atop of their bed, and he reached under the bed for a small box. As he spoke "I've been thinking, Would you mind possibly wearing something only for my eyes while we're in this room~? I also bought a few...Er...Magazines for ideas, for different outfits...And...other stuff."* - Tue Dec  1 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) scratched his cheek, they could do this later. And slowly he laid behind her, pulling her closer. "Yuriko...Talk to me, I can help you."* - Tue Dec  1 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Ngng...  - Tue Dec  1 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Too many stories. - Tue Dec  1 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Too many emotions. - Tue Dec  1 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: All cloudy. - Tue Dec  1 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: All shattered. - Tue Dec  1 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Bloody..blood...shatter...shatter..crack.... - Tue Dec  1 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) wondered if he...went to far, no he was sure  he did. As he spoke "Calm down...focus on my voice...Yuriko. Don't focus on the stories...Not now...Focus on only me...And the story we're creating. The emotions you feel as we build it...Forget about everything else." His arm aimed to wrap around her. "I'll always protect you, we'll have a happy ending."* - Tue Dec  1 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked towards Yuriko as she screamed out louder, and he shut up, and let her go. He wasn't sure how to fix this, not at all, which was problematic for him...He knew she'd make it through this, but for now he kept silent. * - Tue Dec  1 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) he guessed the saying be careful what you wished for applied to him. Bus as she had her back turned to him, his hands were raised, making a single handseal. As he bought her back to their utopia. He figured he'd let her recover here for a while, as he rested beside her on the 'sand'.* - Tue Dec  1 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) simply sighed, "This is going to be troublesome.." He thought to himself.* - Tue Dec  1 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Staing at walls - Tue Dec  1 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stands up, as he began to declothe, and headed to the edge of the water. "Yuriko, I've been thinking...Could you name me?"* - Wed Dec  2 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: I wonder... - Wed Dec  2 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) sits beside Yuriko on the beach, "Hey....can you give me...A name?"* - Wed Dec  2 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Going to the doc's tomorrow, So if I have meds, I shud be good by thursday - Wed Dec  2 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked towards her as she entered the area, and he blinked, noticing the blood. "What happened?" He asked,he already knew she was okay so that question wouldn't be neccessary.* - Wed Dec  2 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Someone didn't have anyone to care for them. - Wed Dec  2 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He was stupid. - Wed Dec  2 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...I think he liked it. - Wed Dec  2 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: laughing* - Wed Dec  2 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ....Liked it? - Wed Dec  2 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hehehe... He smiled. - Wed Dec  2 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And then he screamed. - Wed Dec  2 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was beginning to learn more about this new Yuriko, and he took a deep breath. "When you ate him? Did he at least taste good?" He asked leaning forward as he looked towards her.* - Wed Dec  2 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared into her eyes, "Mm, Is that so? I wish I could've seen that look in your eyes." He watched her expression, and took notice of the tone in her voice. "I'm glad you enjoyed that meal though~." He stated lightly, he felt like her current attitude was reason for concern. But oddly...It was interesting.* - Wed Dec  2 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "It seems not all people are as smart as us, But either way...I am truly happy you ate something delicious." He stated with a gentle smile, which appeared after she licked the blood. "Do you intend to wash off to get the blood off?" He asked.* - Wed Dec  2 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ran his tongue across his lips, when she bent forward, his gaze found her cleavage. And perhaps stayed for a moment to long, "Mm, I wasn't sure if you intended to wear that again...And I was hoping for some company." He stated, locking eyes with her, he figured those walking by needed a reward for their hard work afterall.* - Wed Dec  2 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head, as he stood,."Don't worry about it, Shall we head to the bathroom? Get you cleaned off~." He turned and stopped "I'd even be willing to carry my Princess Yuriko~, If she desired."* - Wed Dec  2 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head "Mm, It's no problem. If I get dirty, I'll just have to get in with you." He stated, walking around the table. He'd aim to lift her up in his arms, before  aiming to walk into the room and then he'd aim to set her on a chair in their room. "I was thinking, while we go to take a bath would you like to visit that beautiful place again?" He'd ask taking a knee before her. On the ground.* - Wed Dec  2 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked up to her "Mm, I thought you might enjoy it anyway~." He stated, as his hand reached down to lift her right foot, he'd begin removing the shoe, and once it was off, he'd plant a kiss on the foot, before beginning to remove her left shoe and repeating the process. Slipping a hand beneath her dress, he'd aim to grab ahold of her panties, and begin pulling them off of her, while giving her inner thigh a little kiss. "I'd be able to allow you to feel the heat, and comforting warmth of the water, and other things, as well..It'd be more comfortable for you." He stated.* - Wed Dec  2 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked towards her as she asked, he looked up to her "Because, like the rest of you...they're beautiful, and don't receive a lot of attention. I adore, all of your body and mind, afterall."  He stated, standing from his kneeling position, after looking at her sex. He'd stand, offering her a hand up, and should should she have stood, he'd begin helping her out of her dress, before her stockings. * - Wed Dec  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked towards her as he stared at her nude blood splattered form, it was oddly arousing. "Why're you scared, Yuriko?" He stated, beginning to undo his own clothing but after removing his shirt, and shoes he looked to Yuriko "Could you do the rest~?" He asked, he was curious why she was scared, hell this was only the second time he heard her use the word and he wasn't torturing her.* - Wed Dec  2 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) worked on that bra as well.* - Wed Dec  2 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched as she moved to undo his belt, and slowly he stepped out of his pants when it was time, followed by his boxers.  He felt his manhood brush against her soft cheek, which resulted in causing a subtle surprised gasp to escape his mouth. He felt that all to familiar churning in his stomach, as he stepped forward, he'd look into her eyes as he spoke "Then...It's time...I introduce you to the good ones, only if....You want to. I don't want you to experience the bad around me...Only the good, My Precious Yuriko...If you trust  me...We can explore the good ones together." He stated, as his hands moved to her hips, as he pressed himself against her looking down to her, from this 'hugging' position.* - Wed Dec  2 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "I just...Wanted a name, that only you would call me by, When it's just the two of us." He stated, looking down at her.* - Wed Dec  2 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Kaiju - Wed Dec  2 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked to her as he spoke "Strange Creature...Monster." He stated, with a light chuckle. "I see." He stated in reference to his name. "If that's what you want, so be it." He stated lightly. "Shall we hop in?"* - Wed Dec  2 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Y-yeah. - Wed Dec  2 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) turns to grab her hand, gently, as he began to lead her into the bathroom setting the water.* - Wed Dec  2 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) set his gaze on her, as he slowly moved in, to sit facing her, his legs found the outter side of the water as he spoke "Stretch out, Yuriko~, Trust me, It'll be enjoyable. Don't resist it, just focus on new sensations." He stated, as his hands were raised to chest level, making a single seal. The world expanded into their Utopia once again, but unlike their former utopia when they were at a beach, they were in a tub overlooking the vast beautiful ocean, with a sight of an untouched green forest. * - Wed Dec  2 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, as he slowly stood, before attempting to re-enter behind her. Had he been able to get into the correct position he'd speak "Yuriko, It's alright...You're fine, don't think about anything else. Focus on what you're seeing, and feeling in actuality. It doesn't hurt, does it?"* - Wed Dec  2 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) wrapped his arms around her slowly, with the help of the water. He guided her back against him. "Relax, lean into me. Listen to the sounds, of the animals...The birds, chirping. Listen to the sound of the waves in the distance. Feel the soothing warmth of the water." He guided her, aiming to push her into a relaxed state. As he reached for a clothe, and dunked it into the water.* - Wed Dec  2 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved to kiss her neck, as she stopped trembling. His arm rested across her lap, and his other arm bought the clothe up to her chest, and began slowly rubbing across her breasts. She'd be able to feel the wet yet, 'rough', clothe material going across her nipples, and all the sensations that would accompany that normally. It went, over, between, and under her breasts, making sure to clean off all the blood before dropping it down into the water. He shifted a bit, so that his manhood rested against her rear. "Yuriko, It's almost unbelievable how soft your skin is, how smooth." He spoke in a light tone.* - Wed Dec  2 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched as she leaned her head back, exposing her neck, he leaned in and ran his tongue along the extended neck. The warmness and wet sensations caused by this would be felt, followed by another kiss. His hand drifted back up to beneath her breasts, and began going over her stomach, taking his time washing her, as the wash clothe drifted over her belly button, and to her lower stomach, before he once again dipped it into the water.* - Wed Dec  2 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) gave her another light kiss  on the neck "This is how...people feel." He stated, as his clothe drifted between her legs. Rubbing the rough fabric of the cloth against her clit, before drifting lower against her sex. "Though...It gets...much...better. If you give it time." As she moaned, he bit his bottom lip, enjoying that sound a lot. Along with all her movements, his manhood had begun to react, and began growing against her butt, he felt his body getting hotter as well.* - Wed Dec  2 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) wondered for a moment, he didn't neccessarily have to restrict her movements...Did he? Or perhaps he was simply that skilled he could control the genjutsu. So he took care not to do so only effecting touch, sight, and sound.  He smiled as her thighs closed around her hand. "Happiness~?"  He asked, as his fingers moved against her sex through the clothe in small motions, which were what he could muster while being confined between her thighs. He planted another kiss on her neck, aiming to let her have her fun he was enjoying this greatly.* - Thu Dec  3 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) released a low gasp, as she grinded against him. His cock pressed firmly against her as he aimed to maneuver it between her cheeks. Removing his hand for a moment he discarded the clothe, and returned his hand between her legs. "This may feel a bit better~." He warned, as he moved to cup her sex, his middle finger rubbing around her entrance, before he aimed to stick the tip of his finger into her sex, while applying a bit of pressure as his wrist rubbed and pressed against her clit.* - Thu Dec  3 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched as she leaned back against him, he desperately wished he could maintain this while both of them enjoyed themselves...But that wasn't currently in his capabilities, Yuriko came first right now anyway, but he could help but find himself getting excited as he heard her moan. It caused his heart to race, but he had to focus, as he slowly pushed the rest of his middle finger into her. Before pulling it out mostly, so that just the tip remained within her, before driving it back in. He felt her hand grip his thigh and he smiled, she was definately enjoying herself.* - Thu Dec  3 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt her rubbing against him, and he was resisting his growing urge. But with the sound of her moans resonating within his ears, he felt the desire to please her first. Allowing her to get exactly what she wanted, but slowly he inserted a second finger, thrusting them in and out of her, while his wrist, rubbed against her clit. But he suddenly had an idea, he hooked his two fingers lightly within her,before continuing his motions of pushing in and out. They started off slow but became faster as time went on. "Mm,  Does it feel good Yuriko~?" He asked, not really needing a reply. But he was getting an interesting idea.* - Thu Dec  3 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) had a really interesting idea...Well two of them, as he began to intensify the levels of pleasure she would be feeling. As his pumping in and out of her continued, but not quite to the level of an orgasm, he'd pull his fingers out of her, before he'd allow his hands to meet. Before making a single seal, creating a single clone much unbeknownst to herself. Who would keep the genjutsu running, so he wouldn't have to focus. "Mm, Yuriko...Would you mind letting us both feel good?" He asked, his hard member pressed against her rear. "I assure you...It'd feel a -lot- better in no time..~" He stated, with a kiss to her neck,  as his hand, moved back between her legs, lightly brushing against her clit. "Take me inside of you~." He stated. He had been waiting for some time.* - Thu Dec  3 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) decides against it, and has the clone, amplify her pleasure, so she can experience her first orgasm. Once she had if she had, he'd stand, and help her out of the bath.* - Thu Dec  3 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: group* - Thu Dec  3 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But I mean - Thu Dec  3 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) as he entered the room, his gaze fell upon Sixty Nine, he examined the male carefully. Silently examining and assessing his appearance and the current state of the room. It was all interesting, he hadn't honestly expected to go meet someone today. It was something that had been pushed off time and time again . Once he entered he stood in the door way, but made no attempt to alert the others of his prescence. He was simply curious and watching.* - Thu Dec  3 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: Yuriko has definately changed. - Thu Dec  3 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) didn't say or do anything he watched, examining his body. His abilities, in a calm manner, "Fire?" He thought to himself before he heard Nine's words about being frosty. "And...Ice?" He considered it for a moment, but never spoke aloud. He wondered how Yori and Yuriko would handle this, he highly doubted Yuriko would get hurt. So he wasn't concerned, he also doubted Yori would let himself get hurt.* - Thu Dec  3 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: U-uhm. - Thu Dec  3 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He's like you. - Thu Dec  3 22:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He's so normal. - Thu Dec  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sixty-Nine(Ama No Murakumo) says: So why are you letting me go again? - Thu Dec  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Other than wanting to hurt people. - Thu Dec  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Becauuuuuse.~ - Thu Dec  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't like that they locked all of you up and lied to Yosuke. - Thu Dec  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And you are similiar to me! - Thu Dec  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: So more friends like me. - Thu Dec  3 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Are you human? - Thu Dec  3 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hmmmm? - Thu Dec  3 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sixty-Nine(Ama No Murakumo) says: Heh. - Thu Dec  3 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sixty-Nine(Ama No Murakumo) says: Im not even sure. - Thu Dec  3 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oooooh, that's okay. We will figure it out.~ - Thu Dec  3 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Lets go! We have more cages to open! - Thu Dec  3 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sixty-Nine(Ama No Murakumo) says: Mmkay. - Thu Dec  3 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled subtly once Yuriko stopped, his gaze settled upon her for a moment as his hand was raised in greeting to both Yuriko and to Nine.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) (*One & Two sat within his room, well the corner of his room. His bed was untouched, he was currently on the ground, his kneens tucked in, his eyes placed over his kneens while slouched over.

"Sis...*sob* Sis.." the child cried in low sobs, tears flowing from his eyes. His personality in question was the complete opposite of his sister Two.*)* - Thu Dec  3 23:45:29 2015

He figured they'd be fine, he was curious about the boy's sister. He was carefully analyzing the child, and he subtly scratched his chin as his hazel eyes focused on his person.  Thirteen was fairly interested in this boy's potential, but he also acknowledged, that he could simply be a normal person, who wasn't...Anything special. Maybe his sister would be different only time would tell.* - Fri Dec  4 00:00:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) walked forward at a steady pace, his gaze shifted to Yuriko as the guards were hit by the water. And he continued to step forward, his black boots touching the ground. Making a steady tapping sound as he progressed, his blonde hair hung low over his face. Almost eclipsing his hazel eyes,  he watched the guards get thrown away and killed by the waves. As he stepped behind Yuriko, "I wonder if they'll be entertaining." He thought aloud, he hoped they wouldn't be....Annoying.* - Fri Dec  4 23:59:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched as the others went about killing and slaughtering, all the while, he remained silent, simply watching and observing he intended to save his strength should any big fish arrive. But his hands were raised to chest level, and made a single handseal, and his chakra was sent out over a massive area, aiming to capture a large sum of people in a low ranking Genjutsu which was beyond the potential to cause lethal damage to the brain. It costed him a small amount of chakra so he didn't care much. 

He continued walking, after all those he had captured were dead, inhaling followed by a deep exhale. He knew that, even civilians as well as Low ranking Shinobi could become...Problematic...in every sense of the word.* - Sat Dec  5 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) turned and proceeded to leap upon the map of the village, he took a seat upon the wooden frame. "How nice of them, to give us a guide on where to go, really...They shouldn't have." He stated, looking towards the next group that had approached them ."Will they be interesting?" He wondered to himself, as his gaze settled upon the next contenders.* - Sat Dec  5 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh yeah suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure, just stand there and look cute Yori-kun! - Sat Dec  5 01:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whistles casually, as he sits upon the sign, his gaze travaled from person to person and with a look to his side he looked at each individual, before stepping down from his perch on the sign. "Two at the rear, Four to the front,  Five to the side. Seems like this will be a pretty nice dance." He spoke, he had taken this time to assess the way each person presented themselves.His hand was raised to chest level, and a single seal was formed. Yet instead of releasing his chakra he held onto it. He had yet to decide upon his targets. "I wonder, who looks the most tasty?"* - Sat Dec  5 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head, as the moment Kana lept from the building. "You are all....Stupid~" Before he had even opened his mouth his chakra had flared out as per finishing the handseals last round. It was sent toward , Anguo, Kana, Iwatobi, Geo, and Kyubishu. "Calm thy selves." He muttered, as the moment they all began preparations for their attacks. A large tree would snake out of the ground, wrapping them all within it's confines. Kana specifically would've been aimed to capture her before she lept off the roof. But the Genjutsu would seem as if she was captured mid-air. 

"Talk about getting yourself tied up." 

He thought to himself, he wondered why there had been a lack of attacks towards him...He felt neglected, at the same token, since he had taken a brief analysis of the battle field. He knew the current positioning of all which had been there, drawing up a mental grid of the place. And thanks to the brief show of speed by Geo, and Anguo's abilities...He had a pretty basic understanding of what was going on. It interested him greatly, they were so.....Basic.* - Sat Dec  5 02:10:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) raised his hand, making a single seal, as the dragon came his way. Because that was all he needed to see, If he was going to die. Fuck it so was this girl,  Though he didn't fear death at all. It was oddly, poetic, So as this single seal was made. His chakra flared out, aimed at Kana's person, she'd immediately feel a immense form of nausea with the world around her blurring, and she'd no doubt feel herself sinking and losing focus. Possibly making the dragon beneath her unstable. Even if he was hit, he doubted she'd be able to safely dismount without becomming a victim of the speed and power of her own dragon.* - Sat Dec  5 03:04:44 2015
