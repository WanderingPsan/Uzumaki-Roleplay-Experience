He'd open a cabinet, before he slowly pulled out a bottle followed by two shot glasses.

He'd bring all the items over to the table where they sat, this time taking a seat beside her on the cushion instead of on the floor. He'd pout the first shot, raising it to his lips, he'd slowly tilt it back, downing it in a single motion. Afterwards, he'd exhale sharply, before pouring the second and downing it just as fast. He felt the alcohol rolling down his throat. 

He distinctly felt like it 'warmed' him some. But he nodded his head, the buzz comming on, since his 'tolerance' had lowered.* - Sat Nov  7 16:10:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) grunted a bit, pouring the first shot once, again, noticing her smile he chuckled a bit. Raising the glass to his lips, it was downed, and he shook his head as he felt the 'buzz' sink in for a moment, before being repelled, and he reached for the second and repeated the process. He sighed briefly, deciding to remove his armor, not like he'd need it.* - Sat Nov  7 16:15:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked followed by a blush, as he saw the dress falling down her sides, revealing her panties. He coughed nervously, as his gaze was averted as he spoke "A-Ah...Only for five or so seconds." He stated looking towards her feet, he wondered if she was wearing shoes or not. Though it was a small curiosity, after a moment. He'd slide the dice over to where she sat.* - Sat Nov  7 16:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) didn't comment on her slippers, but he wondered if she stole those,  not that he honestly cared. Her flexibility came as a shock to him, but he slowly rolled the dice.* - Sat Nov  7 16:43:05 2015

He couldn't contain his laughter "A hero, Ortho the brave!" He stood up before leaning against the wall, the look on his face, was one of hysterical laughter as he spoke "He wanted to be Un-Ortho-Dox!" He laughed, as if completing the best joke of his life, before his laughter came to an abrupt stop, looking down to Owari as he simply stated.

"I hate him, I always have. He believes in Heroes, he wanted to Save the world and get the girl. He wanted to be your Knight...In shining white armor.  Attack the Gezo!? Ha! Biggest Joke I've ever had." 

He paused, his hand going over his face containing his laughter as he spoke "He's Orthodox!, His methods....They're normal, But he's to blind to see. Even with his eyes  as they are now...As Hideki's were.... He's to blind to see. Did you ask him How Hideki died? How Hideki's sensei died?"  He paused, looking at her as he spoke:

"Of course you didn't. You didn't know what to ask."

His face became grim "Suicide, And Suicide.  They're all pitiful Humans....---Humans....The name for cattle, It's befitting of such trash...Ortho, His blood line..." He stared down at her, for a moment, his gaze was pity, but then it shifted to a emotionless gaze, it was cold.

"I, want to teach Ortho....In this world, there is no such thing as a Hero...There is no such thing as Peace...Peace is based on where you sit. Which side of the spectrum you gaze at, Peace----It is boring, The ideal...And he searches for such a thing....Grasps for it! We...We weren't made to strive for peace, All Humans go against...Their natural make up, that's why they're weak. We were built...To Kill...To have war. We weren't given claws, nor fangs, we were given the best weapon of all...Intellegence...A trait most Humans choose not to use."

He paused.

"I want...To teach Ortho a lesson, that can only be learned...With his Death. Heroes, Villians, good and Evil. They're all...One in the same."* - Sat Nov  7 17:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked down at Owari as he simply stated "He is a man, blinded by his 'righteous heart'.  The path to hell is paved in good intentions, And so is the desire of revolution. He is unable to see past his goal, and that will be his downfall. He follows, the path of those who've died, without seeking to change himself to avoid the same fate. That is the man, you follow. He will attack the Gezo, and he will die." He stated with finality.* - Sat Nov  7 17:47:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Alright. I suppose that will do. - Sat Nov  7 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head as he looked to Ikaro, he inhaled followed by a subtle exhale.  He watched the man's hands contort to make a series of handseals which would be needed to cast this technique, and he nodded his head. And sighed, that was truly a massive amount of water Ikaro had released, and he found that to be definately intriguing, he had been wondering for a long period of time. About the water element. 

But he was partially interested in mixing it with the Earth element, he wondered what could be born from it, he smiled warmly understanding that the possibilities were endless. It'd only be a matter of time before he was able to successfully mix the two, even if it amounted to nothing he'd be completely fine with that, but he figured it was time to begin attempting this technique. His hands were raised together.

Recalling the handseals he had seen Ikaro weave just moments before he nodded his head a few more times, smiling warmly, as his hands begn to move together, meanwhile his mind was all over the place, he wondered if the mixture of the two elements would cause some sort of 'erosion', he figured that'd be amazing but incredibly dangerous.

He didn't seem to mind hard work, and he enjoyed learning but there was a lot more he'd rather be doing with the opposite sex if you catch my drift. He continued though practicing the transition from seal to seal, he was eager to improve, he had to he desired to, it'd make his life so much easier, if he managed to imprive.

So he ran his tongue across his lips, going through the seals once agian, he nodded his head he began to feel as if he had what he needed to do so far, so he began thinking of applications this technique would have in battle. He knew it'd have many, he was thinking if he could make a technique from the earth element he could use in conjunction with this one, it'd definately be astonishing so all he could do is prepare.

Ikaro was a pretty good teacher, he didn't honestly mind learning from the male, he assumed Lera had learned from him as well. And he assumed he wouldn't begin training him just to kill him, so he smiled to himself, the seals he felt like was the hardest part of the technique...It'll take the most work, because of the transition it wsas a new pattern he had to memorize.

He figured this was a good start, he'd learn to improve from here, he felt like he'd be a force to be reckoned with if he improved his arsenal, he wanted to desperately, to get better, he wouldn't get destroyed by Ortho...Not again he had to improve, get stronger, stay stronger...He had to,so he focused and stayed on task.

After he felt like he had gotten the seals down, he nodded his head and had decided to this time work on the chakra flow, weaving a series of handseals, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale as he began to slowly gather his chakra        is stomach, beginning to mould it into that of water, taking a deep breath he'd smile. Holding it as he allowed the particles to propagate.

Two fingers were raised to the side of his mouth, as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, releasing a torrent of water forward, which was aimed at spreading outupon the water's suraface, the water spewed from between his lips like an endless fountain, aiming to wash away anything in his way. He focused making sure to keep his chakra flow balanced.

After a moment the torrent of water would come to an end and his hand would drop to his side before he looked at Ikaro he spoke "I think I got it." He was fairly excited, he had made a major improvement and that made him fairly happy, so he took a deep breath and took a seat on the ground, looking towards Ikaro, he seemed a bit tired himself.* - Sat Nov  7 19:49:58 2015
