<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath, why did he agree to these actions, definately seemed like he would have a higher potential to harm than do anything that wouldn't result in pain--But he wondered if she actually cared, but he took a deep breath. Before he slowly raised his leg, bringing his foot around he aimed it at her arm. He definately held back, not that he had the strength to break an arm. "You o-okay?" He asked, assuming she stayed still he wanted to make sure she wasn't hurt.* - Wed Oct 14 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Wait....That means she could potentially end up kicking me in the face of Vice Vers---- - Wed Oct 14 01:25:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as the dice was aimed at his head, and was efficently pegged by them. "O-Ouch, W-What was that for?" He asked,  rubbing his face as he moved to pick up the dice, definately the dice stung a bit.* - Wed Oct 14 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For not having long sleeves. - Wed Oct 14 01:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as he looked at her. "W-Well m-my bad...A-And.." He looked down, deciding a throwing stuff rule ---Dammnit she outsmarted him. "T-True."* - Wed Oct 14 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked he on the other hand did blush slightly, as she leaned forward filling her lips on his arm. He swallowed hard, his eyes were averted for a moment, as she pulled back. A single hand was raised towards his cheek, scratching it out of embarrassment, as he procceeded to be pegged by the dice, before he decided to roll the first one.* - Wed Oct 14 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Leg... - Wed Oct 14 01:39:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: N-No...I-It doesn't... - Wed Oct 14 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was still a bit shocked in response to her legs being placed on his lap, he felt his heart accelerating a bit. His blush becomming a bit more pronounced, as he contemplated what he was doing. He swallowed hard, before his hands moved down to lift one of her legs, assuming it was covered in the same material as her body suit.

He'd take a deep breath aiming to calm his nerves, before he leaned forward, extending his tongue "A-Am I really doing t-this?" He asked himself mentally, as he moved to press his tongue against her leg, running it along the fabric of her clothe about half way. Before he retracted his tongue, definately embarrassed but he lowered her leg back, leaving it up to her if she kept her legs where they were.

"U-Um..."He mumbled, eyes moving to the side, as he extended his hand for the dice.* - Wed Oct 14 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --- - Wed Oct 14 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was kind of hoping she took the gauntlets off, but he guessed she wouldn't. So he closed his eyes and braced himself, as he felt the cold metal of the fingers pinch upon his cheek he winced "O-Ouch.." He muttered, resisting the urge to pull away, though it definately hurt, especially when she pulled to and fro. Once she released, there was a noticable red mark, and he rubbed his cheek, as if he could somehow rub out the pain. "D-Damn that hurt.."* - Wed Oct 14 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) appreciates the kind passing of the dice, he checked her face, fully expecting a grin, he continued to rub his cheek. Wondering what he'd get this time, though he'd had...Pretty decent luck thus far.* - Wed Oct 14 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Foot... - Wed Oct 14 01:53:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath, as he pulled his foot back, and sent it forward, aiming to kick the side of her foot, rather than her heel. Before he retracted his foot placing it back down, he partially believed, this next roll would result in his death, as he nervously handed her the dice.* - Wed Oct 14 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Safeeeee. - Wed Oct 14 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) raised his foot, which was currently covered by his black boot, waiting for the poke to occur.* - Wed Oct 14 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt the covered handpoke her, he was able to feel it but luckily no pain was felt, and slowly he took the dice, and slowly rolled before taking a deep breath. He had managed to survive this long.* - Wed Oct 14 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Foot...Again. - Wed Oct 14 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: -- - Wed Oct 14 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) scratched his chin, these dice were definately making him out to be a pervert, and slowly he moved his hands, attempting to lift her foot. Before he swallowed hard, he assumed she was wearing some sort of shoe, but he looked at it. Before leaning forward, attempting to plant a kiss atop of her foot, before looking away as he scratched his cheek, lowering her foot back down to his lap unless she removed it prior.* - Wed Oct 14 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would look away briefly, before he had an idea, he extended the back of his hand forward, as if he was some sort of entitled prince or princess, deciding if they were to do this, he assumed it'd be good to have fun?* - Wed Oct 14 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiles lightly, as he retracts his hand there was a bit of a blush as he spoke "After this roll..I believe this is round Five...So we're upping it?" He asked looking at her but decided to go for his roll.* - Wed Oct 14 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: C-Chest.. - Wed Oct 14 02:09:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) swallows hard, and for the first time, his eyes actually looked at Katsune's chest, I mean he had to know where he was going through with the action. But after a moment his eyes were averted to her shoulder... He swallowed hard once again, and his face lit up, before his hand slowly inched forward. Two fingers moved to the area, just above her breasts, before he aimed to lightly pinch down on the area. Just a normal pinch, he didn't go out of his way to hurt her.

But immediately afterwards his hand was withdrawn, looking away as he spoke: "W-Would you like t-to remodle the actions? Or c-change the parts of the body?" * - Wed Oct 14 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath and nodded his head as he spoke "I...I like that idea of going higher than six numbers, Make six more actions...And I'll pick six my body parts?" He suggested looking at her, before he wondered what they could do to incorperate money so he decided to ask "How w-would you incorperate money?" He asked lightly, before he extended his hand as if asking for the bottle, he'd definately need it.* - Wed Oct 14 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) takes a deep breath and slowly raises the bottle to his lips taking a large sip, as he took notice of her extra actions...Realising how violent they've gotten. He figured he may be forced to use his safety net more than a few times. "S-Sure..." He agreed before he spoke:

"T-Then the extra body parts are...lips, stomach, neck, butt, back, and...cheek?"* - Wed Oct 14 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as she got the matches, and was definately surprised when she placed her legs on his lap again. His eyes averted with a light blush. "L-Ladies first?" He stated offering her the die.* - Wed Oct 14 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Leg.. - Wed Oct 14 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her slap his leg, and it twitched lightly, only out of reflex, but he looked at her as she tossed the dice towards him, and moved to catch it---If only he was fast enough and as such he was pegged once again "Ouch.." He stated lightly, before rolling both die at once.* - Wed Oct 14 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: B-Butt.. - Wed Oct 14 02:35:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked away briefly, for a moment, before he turned as Katsune got herself into position, he felt his heart racing. And his face was definately as red as a tomato out of embarrassment, as he looked at her skirt and her butt, he swallowed hard. Before looking at his hand this was definately not how he envisioned the night going,  as he looked at her. He slowly swung his hand forward attempting to hit her butt once. Maybe a bit on the harder side, but that wasn't intentional.

His gaze found his hand, before shifting off to the side, as he waited for her to sit back down, and he offered her the dice back. He wasn't sure how much more he could take.* - Wed Oct 14 02:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt like this was divine intervention, so as her foot connected with his arm, he closed his eyes and braced for it. And the heel of her boot connected,sending pain through his arm, he gasped in pain winching. As he cursed under his breath "S-Shit..." He muttered, as the pain radiated from the point of impact, his hand moving over, where her heel connected in an attempt to nurse it, but he'd definately have a bruise. * - Wed Oct 14 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) using his other arm both dice are launched into the air.* - Wed Oct 14 02:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her as she kicked her boots off before he averted his gaze. "I think...I'd like to take my safety. So...Penialize me." He stated looking away.* - Wed Oct 14 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sake. . . - Wed Oct 14 02:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) offers the dice back to her, as he reaches for one of the glasses she pre-prepared. And slowly he took a deep breath, before raising the glass to his lips, aiming to down it in a single go. He felt his mind go hazy for a moment, but he shook his head, looking at her. The taste of the alcohol rolling down his throat.* - Wed Oct 14 02:53:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) agreed with the notion it was a poke, so it was fine, he got poked in the back and on the neck. Before he took the dice back, tossing them up.* - Wed Oct 14 02:55:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked looking forward it was an odd sensation, getting a back rub from something cold and metal, but he beared with it taking the dice they were tossed up.* - Wed Oct 14 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Foot.. - Wed Oct 14 03:03:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) slowly looked down to his lap extending a single finger, he'd move to press it against her foot. Poking it gently, before retracting his finger with a warm smile, he offered the dice back to her.* - Wed Oct 14 03:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) gasped in pain, as he felt the kunai pierce his flesh, feeling the cold steel move across. He bit his bottom lip, before he looked towards Katsune, it definately hurt a lot, but luckily it would probably stop bleeding on it's own in a minute or so. It definately stung, and he felt the pain surge through his leg. But he couldn't deny each and every one he had to take them eventually. He knew this, and so he decided to tie his headband over the wound because why not. Taking the dice he tossed them up again.* - Wed Oct 14 03:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) contemplated it for a moment as he decided to give it a shot, he did blush a tad faintly before his hands found her lower leg, and slowly he attempted to mimic the fondling motion on her calf, almost ending up being a kneading motion on her calf, though after a moment his hands were retracted, he said nothing but offered her the dice back.* - Wed Oct 14 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Cheek.. - Wed Oct 14 03:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --- - Wed Oct 14 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) had his own problem with the pinkening of his cheeks, as she leaned forward he stared forward, before feeling her tongue move across his cheek. And before he could relish in the moment, he felt her fist connect with his nuts, forcing him to double over, as both hands found his crotch. He nearly fell off the couch, as he gasped and moaned in pain.  There was even some tearing in his eyes.* - Wed Oct 14 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watches the dice hit the floor before him, and reaches out to get them, still in pain. As his dice were tossed up, struggling to sit up right to see what he got. Man did his nuts hurt, he would've asked why she punched him, but he didn't feel like that'd help his case any.* - Wed Oct 14 03:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) tosses her the dice, and reaches for a glass of sake, downing it like the first, he felt the heat moving through his body. And oddly it helped suppress his pain a bit, but he blinked a few times, he'd probably only be able to survive one more.* - Wed Oct 14 03:26:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as she leaned forward, and as he felt her tongue going up and down his neck. He gasped out, and immediately he noticed a problem was developing, his blush intensified, as he shifted uncomfortably on the couch, a single arm going across his crotch, before he looked away, taking the dice in hand he tossed it up. Defiantely embarrassed greatly.* - Wed Oct 14 03:35:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as she leaned forward, looking into her eyes as she looked into his. And as he noticed how close she was, he leaned back a bit out of embarrassment. His face still lit up, especially when he felt her breath against him with every exhale. His heart raced, and if he was thinking clearly. He probably would've considered the fact of her punching him again, but he wasn't. So he nervously closed his eyes, swallowing hard.* - Wed Oct 14 03:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as his eyes were closed, he wasn't expecting what was comming at all. Her fist connecting with him like a rocket, the hardened gauntlet, sending such pain trough his face with that single strike he recoiled back, this time probably falling off the couch as he hit the ground with a thud. If he wasn't unconcious, his world was definately swimming and dazed. His head hurt a lot, and probably he had a cut on the side of his face, though that probably wasn't major. If he managed to retain conciousness.

He'd blink multiple times, trying to get his eyes to focus as he shook his head. "W-What..." He mmbled as he tried to focus--That was assuming he was concious.* - Wed Oct 14 03:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked a bit as she spoke "S-Swimming in the earth?" The concept had never crossed his mind, and she definately had his attention now.* - Wed Oct 14 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her as she spoke examining and taking in every word she stated, and nodded his head, though the thought of Katsune being owned somewhat irritated him, he knew it was apart of her past. But regardless, he took in what she said as he nodded his head "I see." He knew that overconfidence was a major force in how people lost fights. But he was surprised she'd admit her short-commings and it increased his respect for her.* - Wed Oct 14 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiled warmly as he spoke "I'd kind of like to sleep off that punch and the sake for a bit...If that's fine with you." He stated, he didn't seem all to annoyed or anything just neutral. "But...I'd be happy to learn it."* - Wed Oct 14 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath and sighed to himself he figured this would be an interesting technique, definately would be valuable in the midst of battle, he was wondering how she learned it, then the male who had identified himself as Kilm had taken credit for teaching her and he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, he considered this to have many applications. But he wasn't all to sure, either way he carefully watched her.

From the moment the demonstration had begun he observed her motions the way she channeled her chakra and sunk into the ground, none was safe from his gaze. He didn't say anything but he took a deep breath inhaling followed by an exhale, he was recovering from his last training session, and sighed to himself, but he knew this technique was something he didn't want to miss out.

He particularly admired the way she managed to sink into the water otherwise unharmed, and he smiled warmly. Escaping battles would be ideal, so would sneaking past people who'd otherwise notice him, he noticed a few variations between her technique and Trilliams, and took note of them, his hands moved together and he cracked his knuckles.

From what he had observed this was also a seal-less technique which only added to it's worth, probably being able to be casted on the fly, definately made it all the more useful to himself, so taking a deep breath he stared forward, watching her as she swam around him. That speed of hers was definately something he admired.

So he took a deep breath, once he saw her pulling herself from the ground and watched how the mud simply fell from her body he had made his decision and this was definately a technique he wanted to go about learning the only question was would he be able to? He wasn't sure, but he'd definately put in some work towards learning it.

Cracking his knuckles he closed his eyes he had decided that the best thing to do. He inhaled followed by an exhale, as he prepared to begin practicing, first he started with his chakra, though he realised this would've been easier had he been able to sense. But that was fine, he took a deep breath and exhaled, before his hands were raised to chest level.

Cracking his knuckles, he decided to begin focusing so he closed his eyes and slowly began invisioning his flow of chakra inside of his body, taking a deep breath he inhaled followed by an exhale. Katsune certainly was a great teacher, or at least made it easy for him to understand so he recognized that as a plus which would aid him.

But regardless after he began focusing his chakra some more, he felt as if he was gradually beginning to understand what he had to do, he wondered what the factual differences were between the two techniques, he figured it'd be great to learn in case of a battle, being able to identify the two of them and also identify their weaknesses would be ideal.

Already his mind was beginning to think of ways to incorperate this technique into his fighting style, and eventually he'd have it all planned out, but for now, he began to gather his chakra, mimicking her motions, as he allowed it to seep into the ground below him and slowly the ground began to turn into a liquid of sorts at his feet.

Taking a deep breath he slowly sunk into the ground, dissappearing effortlessly into the dark depths of this world. After a few moment's he'd resurface looking at her, and with a gentle smile he'd speak "I think I got it." He stated smiling warmly, as he'd move to take a seat on the ground.* - Wed Oct 14 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I reccomend using it during somersaults if you're trying to escape. Don't pull a Kilm and nearly get grabbed by Erebus when you're trying to use your feet for the jutsu, like a dope. - Wed Oct 14 21:17:52 2015

Such a grimy sensation with a rough texture, as he gagged a lot, doing his best to keep the sand in for the remainder of three seconds before spitting it out. Though it wouldn't get all of it out, he had some remaining effects of gritty mush in his mouth.* - Wed Oct 14 21:42:36 2015
