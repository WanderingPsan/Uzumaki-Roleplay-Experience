<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you're not sure, you didn't push your chakra hard enough. - Sat Oct 24 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head as he took a deep breath and looked to Kat, he definately found this technique interesting. He had heard about but never actually seen in practice, but even so he was greatly interested and he wondered how she had learned it for such a mimiscule drain, he didn't have to sense chakra to see that that technique didn't even effect her at all, but he took a deep breath and sighed.

Slowly his eyes followed Kat's hands, watching the seal she had formed, as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, acknowledging the words that she spoke, and he cracked his knuckles, she had given very valuable insight on how this technique was performed, and he yawned slightly. It wasn't out of boredom, he just had a lack of excitement on this day of the week.

But he didn't honestly mind, holding the tiger seal as instructed he took a deep breath and sighed, as he slowly began to rethink the words Katsune had spoken merely moments before, he took deep breaths, before exhaling shortly aftwards, he knew this technique would definately be valuable in the midst of battle, he was surprised he didn't have to deal with any Genjutsu yet, maybe that was a blessing.

But he sighed as he once again raised his hands to chest level, holding the seal he began to slowly concentrate, attempting to take control of his chakra, flow which was easier said than done, but he didn't seem nearly ready to give up, slowly he continued trying, he had excellent chakra control but even so this technique was an interesting one, and though it wasn't complex, it wasn't easy either.

So slowly he grasped control of his flow of chakra, before he slowly attempted to stop it's movement. And eventually his flow of chakra came to a halt, and he smiled briefly, cracking his knuckles as he spoke "Hm...I think I've done it." He stated lightly, definately sure he felt it in his body, it was an interesting process to say the least. And as such, he was sure that sensation he felt was the stopping of his flow of chakra.* - Sat Oct 24 20:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Alright. - Sat Oct 24 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) offers her a scroll.* - Sat Oct 24 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: I plan to do some of my own training outside of our house. - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: You comming? - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: What a suspicious name for a scroll. . . - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Alright. - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) heads off, Man he wished he learned Shunshin it'd be a lot easier.* - Sat Oct 24 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: . - Sat Oct 24 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) simply sat on the ground, he took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a subtle exhale, as he slowly raised his hands to chest level, making a series of handseals, followed by biting his thumb as his hand touched the ground, and immediately a seal sprouted and a small kitten was summoned, after a moment, he repeated the same process, and moments later a Snake was summoned, similar to that of a garden Snake which coiled around his leg.

Unlike most or everyone else in the world, he was definately better equipped to summon animals, and slowly he sighed, taking a deep breath as he cracked his knuckles. Slowly he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, and he began focusing on the techniques he'd learned over the course of the last few months, he didn't focus on one more than the other. But he tried to recall the learning process.

He focused, his goal was to understand his techniques, and he wanted to work on all of them without  expending a ton of chakra. So he focused, his eyes opened briefly once he noticed Katsune approaching him once again, he'd take the scroll, with a gentle smile, he'd nod his head:

"No problem Kat. But as a precaution, be careful,  Try not to make a lot of clones, This technique can harm your health. That was the warning I was given, so I'm Passing it on."* - Sat Oct 24 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as he took the scroll back, he slowly returned to doing what it was he was doing prior, slowly taking in the techniques he had learned, but suddenly he hatched an idea and he began to slowly unravel the scroll he was given as he focused on his techniques, he realised with this technique the possibility for combos, would be practically endless, and that definately excited him, but he inhaled followed by a brief exahale.

He wasn't sure if he was taking the ideal way to get stronger, or if he should sit down and wait, he hadn't been in a real fight, and part of him wondered if he was capable of handling himself, he definately didn't want to have someone protect him in a serious fight, so he needed to get stronger, it was his goal he had to, he had spent a while slacking off and having fun, getting to know, and love those around him.

He figured once he had learned this technique, he could use it as a modifier for his learning, he read that all knowledge gained would transfer back into the host once the clones were dispelled, he wondered if that also went for knowledge gained through the process of training, but he figured he'd only find out if he tried. So he continued reading teaking his time to focus on the technique at hand.

He realised it'd be a long way to train, but he had to muscle through it, taking his time he inhaled followed by a light exhale, as he noticed he was nearing the end of the scroll. Most of his reading had been completed and he decided it was time to actually begin attempting the technique as he stood, he smiled lightly, hands raised to chest level.

Slowly he held the seal, before transitioning into one of a different technique and repeating the process repeatedly, trying to get his transition from technique to technique down, he needed it to be fluid if he ever intended to try it in the heat of a battle, so he continued to try it, he was having fun at this point, and he figured it'd be fun if he ever got into a real battle, he partially wondered if there was anything else he could do to improve his potential.

He knew that this was a painfully boring task, but slowly he continued weaving the seal, he was definately taking his time, and he didn't want to fail himself, or those around him so he continued to practice, pressing onwards, he read, and read onwards, he'd make progress one way or another, he had to, it was his dream and his goal, he desired to learn all there was to offer at any cost, that was the reason he became a spy to begin with.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) had probably given up a while before she did and was sitting on the couch as he spoke "How was your training?" He asked, he seemed to have set out a glass of ice-cold water, and surprisingly a steak for her "You should eat some protein after training, It helps the muscles." He stated lightly.* - Sat Oct 24 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath and sighed to himself as he cracked his knuckles, deciding this would be a fairly interesting thing to do, he sighed to himself, as he continued to focus on the techniques at hand, raising his hands to chest level, he made a single seal holding it as he slowly  channeled his chakra outwards, gathering into that of a real clone which sat at his side  he smiled warmly, as he began to focus.

He figured this would be a fairly interesting thing to try as his clone sat beside him entering a meditative stance, as he cracked his knuckles, and began concentrating along with his clone, slowly they focused on the techniques at hand, preparing to make a difference of sorts as he sighed to himself, deciding this would be a fairly good learning experience.

He yawned to himself, as he began to focusing, inhaling followed by a deep exhale, he was finding the pace in which he was advancing to be almost startling but he decided it was proof of his hard work and as such he was excited, only wishing to improve at a steadier rate, he wondered what would happen if he reached his pinnacle, but he shrugged it off.

He continued doing what he was doing, and eventually he took another scroll out and raised it to his eyes continuing to read, about the technique it was a genjutsu and he had decided it'd be ideal to have at least one in his aresenal, he never knew when one might come in handy so he began  to focus, reading the lines of text, after a few moments he sighed to himself.

Putting the scroll down, he felt as if he had a firm grasp of it and as such he dispelled his clone, and allowed his summonings to be unsummoneed and as such he approached the couch in their house, and plopped down upon it, laying across it as he waited for Katsune to re-enter, which actually wouldn't be that long.* - Sat Oct 24 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) scratched his cheek as he spoke "No problem..I probably should've warmed it up for you though." He stated lightly, sitting up as to give her space when she sat.* - Sat Oct 24 23:31:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Care to have an awkward gaming session as we relax? - Sat Oct 24 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. We can do that. - Sat Oct 24 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Which are you in the mood for? - Sat Oct 24 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: The chicken one? - Sat Oct 24 23:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Should we? - Sat Oct 24 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Easier and less awkward not to. - Sat Oct 24 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Sure. - Sat Oct 24 23:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I suppose I'll start us off then? - Sat Oct 24 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) slowly headed off to grab the dice as he smiled briefly this was a game they hadn't played for a while, so he was actually pretty...Interested in playing it with Katsune again so he took a deep breath as he spoke "Well here goes nothing." He stated, taking the dice he rolled them both forward, hoping to start this game off on a high note.* - Sat Oct 24 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Arm. - Sat Oct 24 23:55:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as she took off her gauntlets but didn't actually say anything. As he raised his hand above her arm, his chakra slowly began to gather there as if he was using chakra flow, before he placed it upon her arm, he held back a lot. And as such it'd probably only burn through the fabric as he spoke "E-Eh...I'm sorry, I'll pay for it later." He offered lightly, it was no doubt hot, but not overpoweringly so. But she'd probably be uneffected.* - Sun Oct 25 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lick leg. . . . - Sun Oct 25 00:02:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm.. - Sun Oct 25 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you prefer being hot or being cold? - Sun Oct 25 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sun Oct 25 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Cold, by far. - Sun Oct 25 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I can agree. - Sun Oct 25 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You can always put more stuff on, But at a certain point you can't take it off. - Sun Oct 25 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd rather be in pain than be light-headed. - Sun Oct 25 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Worst-case-scenario. - Sun Oct 25 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's true. - Sun Oct 25 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) takes the dice and tosses them up silently praying to the dice god.* - Sun Oct 25 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Chest.. - Sun Oct 25 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Cut chest.. - Sun Oct 25 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her legs  resting atop of his lap, as he looked at her, and sighed as he felt if she was fine with it then he should be as well right? So slowly he reached for a pencil, he didn't seem to have a knife with him, so he slowly gathered his chakra into the pencil, increasing the sharpness of the point. As he swallowed hard, looking at her chest for a moment, as the 'blade' was moved forward, before making a vertical cut, the blade was dulled greatly, and aimed between her cleaveage...There was probably a better place he could've aimed. But he wasn't thinking.

It was probably sharp enough to go through the fabric but would only leave a welt on her chest if she didn't avoid it.* - Sun Oct 25 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked a bit as he noticed his handiwork, revealing a small bit of flesh his eyes were averted, slightly. Swallowing hard, as he looked at her next roll. He figured this would be alright for the most part, and as such he'd nod his head, not intending to take a penalty for this though he knew it'd hurt, had she moved her legs from his lap momentarily, he'd pull up his pants leg, before raising his leg up til his foot rested on the edge of the couch, exposing his leg to her.* - Sun Oct 25 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I forgot to pay you when I took the penalty roll. - Sun Oct 25 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) takes the cash nodding his head.* - Sun Oct 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: worst* - Sun Oct 25 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) closed his eyes as he bit the bottom of his lip, preparing for what was to come. And as such, he was unprepared as the clone approached him and slowly held the flame to his leg. His eyes widened as he bit down on his lip "F-Fuck!" He declared, the pain surging through his leg, causing the flesh to sting, as heat spiraled throught he limb. Though she'd probably notice, his skin was a 'bit' thicker than when they initially sparred the first time a few months agao. But he scurried to the kitchen grabbing some ice, before sitting back on the couch.

The pain was very much on his face, and he released occasional moans of pain. But it didn't seem like he was 'angry' but he seemed to be more towards 'excited', if that makes sense. But he channeled his chakra into the ice, and eventually it transformed into bandages which he wrapped around his leg. "A-Ah..." He stated, reaching for the dice. In which he'd roll them.* - Sun Oct 25 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Lips.. - Sun Oct 25 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Rub your...Lips. - Sun Oct 25 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lame. - Sun Oct 25 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Go for it though. - Sun Oct 25 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) actually managed to smile for a bit, as his finger tips were icy, and a tad bit wet after holding ice cubes...So he considered this a miniature payback, but he doubt it'd get a reaction from Katsune. As he extended two fingers towards her lips, tracing them around them. Before he lowered his hand offering her the dice, as he relaxed back on the couch, allowing her to put her legs back on his lap if she desired.* - Sun Oct 25 00:29:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) offered her the Hundred Grand. And moved to take the dice before rolling it.* - Sun Oct 25 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Dare. - Sun Oct 25 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Sun Oct 25 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't have any good dares. - Sun Oct 25 00:32:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Keep an ice cube on your tongue until it melts. - Sun Oct 25 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --- - Sun Oct 25 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No swallowing or spitting it out. - Sun Oct 25 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: That sounded like such an innuendo. - Sun Oct 25 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nods his head as he moved to the freezer, and grabbed an ice cube, before moving to put it in his mouth. He figured this would be a fairly easy dare, until the coldness hit his tongue, but it was bearable for a moment, but it was gradually getting worse. He felt the cold radiating through his mouth, as he felt the coldness stabbing at his inner cheek. His face showed that of discomfort, but he was determined to win this dare, as he reached for the dice and began to roll.* - Sun Oct 25 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: That sounded like such an innuendo. - Sun Oct 25 00:34:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. - Sun Oct 25 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Thought it was lips for a second. - Sun Oct 25 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. Whatever. - Sun Oct 25 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her stomach or rather the fabric which covered it, before swallowing hard as a peek was shot towards where he had cut. He slowly extended his hand over her stomach, and like last time. Chakra gathered over his hand as he placed it across her stomach, he was holding back a lot, as to not hurt her too severly. As the flames would probably burn through the fabric, and inflict a minor burn, if not just plain irritation on her stomach. * - Sun Oct 25 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . . - Sun Oct 25 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Gross, but okay. - Sun Oct 25 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A hundred thousand is a lot. - Sun Oct 25 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) raises his arm, as he looked away, once again swallowing hard. He just knew this would backfire one way or another.* - Sun Oct 25 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked, a little bit of embarrassment showed on his face, as he reached for the dice and prepared to roll the dice.* - Sun Oct 25 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Back* - Sun Oct 25 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Cut. - Sun Oct 25 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as she turned around and when she laid on her stomach the briefest of flances was sent towards her butt, causing a faint blush to appear on his face, as he grabbed his handy dandy, pencil. And once again chakra began to flow through the wooden tool, going across her back horizontally, utilizing about the same power as the one that went across her chest, aimed at cutting through the clothing and leaving a moderately irritating welt on her back. As he offered the dice back to her.* - Sun Oct 25 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ---- - Sun Oct 25 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Going to be painful...But I'll survive. - Sun Oct 25 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) silently cursed "I'm going to regret this." He muttered under his breath, thank god she had taken off her boots, but he didn't think that'd matter much since she had used Domu. But he nodded his head telling her he was ready as he tried his hardest to brace himself for impact.* - Sun Oct 25 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her feet connect with his stomach, and honestly, the pain shot through his stomach, quite litterally knocking the air out of him. But he took the hit a lot better than he anticipated for that matter, he groaned in pain as she pulled her foot back,  before sitting beside him, coughing a few times as he groaned some more. Before reaching for the dice, hoping he'd get something that'd allow him to get some well deserved payback.* - Sun Oct 25 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Lips.. - Sun Oct 25 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hey, I'd like to reccomend a rule. - Sun Oct 25 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Sun Oct 25 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If you roll Rub lips two times within three turns. - Sun Oct 25 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'd like to reroll. - Sun Oct 25 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Is that fair? - Sun Oct 25 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fair enough. - Sun Oct 25 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you want to re-roll when that happens, you can. - Sun Oct 25 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Thanks. - Sun Oct 25 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --- - Sun Oct 25 01:00:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ...'Kay. . . - Sun Oct 25 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) honestly didn't believe the roll at first, his heart felt as if it stopped. As he heard her speak, a faint blush befell his face. He felt the heat which accompanied embarrassment moving through his body as he spoke "T-Then...Here..I-I go..." He stated, as he shyly leaned foward. Hoping that she'd at least meet him half way, he was definately embarrassed. And honestly, with his luck he never anticipated a roll like this which only added to his surprise in the end.* - Sun Oct 25 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after a moment, he moved to clear the gap, causing him to slightly hover her. As he felt his heart beating to a nervous symphony. A tune only to be heard by his own ears, and as such when his lips touched hers. He felt like time stopped for a moment. Almost as if he had entered his own world, cut off from the outside. He wasn't expecting her tongue, or her suckling upon his own and his lack of experience shined through. Though he went with what felt natural, aiming to match her actions with his own.. 

With a sudden influx of emotions and sensations, his face lit up like a tomato. And after a moment of holding the kiss, he slowly pulled away looking at her for a moment, he was simply, at a loss of words. With his eyes averted, he offered the dice to her with eyes averted. * - Sun Oct 25 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I'm going to pray...To the dice god more often. - Sun Oct 25 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) meets her gaze with his own, as his heart seemed to speed up all over again. As she ended the game, he swallowed hard, and nodded his head "Y-Yeah...T-That...That sounds good." He stated lightly standing up, as he looked down to her assuming she hadn't already stood, he'd offer his hand to her a gesture which was becomming habit, even though she usually denied it.* - Sun Oct 25 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- - Sun Oct 25 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. - Sun Oct 25 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Gotta change clothes first. - Sun Oct 25 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as she spoke as he scratched his cheek out of embarrasment "I-I'll buy you another one whenever y-you like."* - Sun Oct 25 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Sun Oct 25 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sun Oct 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot, or.... - Sun Oct 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Shunshin? - Sun Oct 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Your choice. - Sun Oct 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: S-Shunshin is the high speed movement technique right..? - Sun Oct 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Aye. You'd be learning from a scroll. - Sun Oct 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's fine.. - Sun Oct 25 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That the one you want? - Sun Oct 25 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah. - Sun Oct 25 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) takes the scroll as he bowed his head in thanks looking to her as he simply spoke "I'd...Never show anyone, anything you taught me. I thought it'd be wrong for me to do so, especially without at least asking you first.." He spoke, looking towards the scroll in his hand as he spoke:

"I definately won't show anyone."* - Sun Oct 25 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Sun Oct 25 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In the mean time I'll just. . . - Sun Oct 25 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Practice one I got from Seisuke. - Sun Oct 25 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Huh? - Sun Oct 25 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) slowly unraveled the scroll, as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he slowly began to observe the tect which had been written down in the scroll, which would be identified as Katsune's handwriting, slowly he smiled. As he began to slowly read the scroll in his hands, it was definately an interesting technique, he wondered what the person who created this technique was like. But he didn't bother to bring it up.

But slowly he smiled, inhaling followed by a deep exhale, as his hands were raised to chest level. He intended to make a single seal slowly gathering his chakra, he slowly vanished from his spot, in an explosion of smoke. Appearing several feet forward,with a spell of nausea "M-Man...T-That's horrible.." He stated lightly, resiting the urge to puke, as he offered the scroll back to her.* - Sun Oct 25 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as he looked at Katsune as he spoke "R-Really?" Genuinely surprised by this revelation, as he looked to her, he was panting a bit heavily. The first use of Shunshin always did that, he took a bottle of water out and twisted the top off before taking a sip. Resting it on the ground.* - Sun Oct 25 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as Katsune's clone taunted the original, or the original taunted the clone. He was confused, it was hard to tell the difference. But either way he laughed lightly, moving a hand over his mouth to suppress his laughter, it was truly an enjoyable and entertaining sight.* - Sun Oct 25 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. Tired now. - Sun Oct 25 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see.. - Sun Oct 25 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: What now? - Sun Oct 25 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wanna train. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Do you mind? - Sun Oct 25 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Got exams to prepare for after all. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mind training with me I mean. Or watching, or whatever. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Either is fine.. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know other stuff probably seems more fun but that's ninja life for you. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Training or watching, whichever is better for you. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. . . - Sun Oct 25 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Whichever is fine. - Sun Oct 25 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have clones to spar with after all, if you don't feel like helping. - Sun Oct 25 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: No, It's fine, I'll spar with you. - Sun Oct 25 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Speaking of clones. . . - Sun Oct 25 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Probably what I should train first. - Sun Oct 25 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Sun Oct 25 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nods his head, as he slowly lowers into a stance, looking at the clone, he inhaled followed by a brief exhale. Katsune practically destroys him in terms of speed, and any physical abilities he was lacking but with anything Ninjutsu or chakra based, he was your guy. But first his hands were raised to chest level in preparation for the initiation for the spar, not that he was about to fire a jutsu.* - Sun Oct 25 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as the clone rapidly approached him definatley outspeeding him. But he aimed to raise his arms in a defensive manner, aiming to block the assault of kicks comming from the clone. The initial kick, he felt the strength of the Domu enhanced kick send paiun through his arms, a lot of it as well, should he even have been able to block the initial he kept his guard raised as the barrage hit him, eventually he stumbled backwards but he aimed to gather chakra into his left hand.

Flames seemed to spiral outwards, as he recalled Katsune's words, as the ball of flames spiraled, before he launched it woards the ground before the feet of the clonem it definately was powerful, as it connected the ball of flames would've exploded, aiming to not directly harm Katsune's clone, but inflict concussive damage, or light burns.* - Sun Oct 25 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Huh. - Sun Oct 25 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ya know I just realized! - Sun Oct 25 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I master this jutsu my clones can go with you whenever you leave the village. - Sun Oct 25 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This jutsu should be forbidden. It's too good and too dangerous. - Sun Oct 25 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) laughed a bit as she spoke, but that was only after he attempted to roll out of the way of the spikes comming at him. Since he was already on the ground, he hoped this would be plausible, but once he came to a stop. He'd clap his hands together, chakra flowing through his palms, as a large wind would sweep through the area, he didn't hold back so it was probably pretty powerful, aimed at making a dense cloud of sand which would obscure both of their visions, as he moved off to the side, to conceal his prescence. Hopefully.* - Sun Oct 25 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) at the same time as Katsune's clone pours chakra into the ground, the male raises his hands together in order to make a single handseal, and his chakra surrounded the area around them casting a fairly large barrier which was a sphere going into the ground as well. So he was able to locate the clone as it slept into the ground and as such he lept backwards, attempting to evade it's grasp or simply prolong his own capture if at all possible.* - Sun Oct 25 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was definately having large spurts of luck and as such by whatever stroke of luck had befallen him this long, had probably run out as Katsune's clone launched the technique at him, he saw his possibility of escape diminish, as he was caught in the net, and the electricity surged through his body, he grunted out in pain, as he was forced to a knee. The tingling sesnsation radiating throughout his body, as he was definately left strunned and in pain...Witha  few numb places in between.* - Sun Oct 25 02:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Probably a good time to end this. . . - Sun Oct 25 02:19:56 2015
