<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. Then we start with the most simple. - Mon Oct 12 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath and cracked his knuckles, as he slowly examined the technique that the woman was showing him. He was curious as to where she came from and what path she had walked that made her more willing to teach strangers. But it made him happy on some deep level, he looked towards her as she casted the jutsu, taking care to heed her warning in regards to releasing it to early, he inhaled followed by a brief exhale.

His fist was raised to his lips, with a small opening which would allow the funneled air to be shot out, he inhaled, slowly gathering his oxygen in his lungs staring forward, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, his chakra gathering and swirling about until, he began to force it up his throat, before exhaling, releasing a steady torrent of chakra enhanced air, which he then ignited with his chakra. The flames spewing from his lips.

Gathering into that of a stream of flames which shot directly ahead of himself, the flames were continuous and seemed to stay focused, ahead of him, though it was unfocused and untamed as a novice elemental user's techniques would be but they seemed to be somewhat more defined than your average person. After a moment he released his flow of chakra, as he looked towards her. "I think I got it."* - Mon Oct 12 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Not bad - Mon Oct 12 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Next. If you're still good to go. - Mon Oct 12 13:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I definately am! - Mon Oct 12 13:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her as she seemed to simply be a fountain of knowledge,  looking at her as she attempted this next technique, he nodded his head lightly. As he watched as the flames took form before him, "Liquid fire?" He asked himself, but didn't think to much into it, but he did plan to envision it as she had said. But he definately wished he had an affinity to the wind element as she had he figured that'd be great for fire Jutsu.

He smiled warmly benihaling followed by a brief exhale, as he focused on Lera before attempting to follow in pursuit, hands raised to chest level, he made the same seal she had demonstrated. Before he began to conjure his chakra, mimicing her as he took a deep breath through the spacing between his teeth and tongue, before exhaling, envisoning that of liquid flame, he exhaled. Chakra spewing from his lips.

And circling around them, before the flames ignited, much like the first technique, they were weaker than most and untamed, but he did seem remotely excited regarding it. He was finally able to make some progress on his training, much thanks to Lera, and this would definately be a useful skill in the future, he simply hoped he'd have a chance to practice it before it really counted.* - Mon Oct 12 13:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright....and the next. - Mon Oct 12 13:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as he noticed it seemed like she was kicking it up a notch, scratching his chin. As he watched her motions, watching her hands as they moved together, followed by envisoning the flow of chakra that she must've utilized, he took a deep breath and inhaled, this was definately a bit more exciting, a bit more dangerous, and would require a little more focus. He ran a single hand through his hair as he focused.

Deciding to first work on his handseals, his hands were bought to chest level, beginning to inhale followed by a deepp exhale. Slowly he attempted to work with the handseals, his hands were slow to form each seal, and slowly he yawned. But even so his focus was focused on that of the technique he didn't want to squander the opportunity he was given so he cracked his knuckles.

Running a single hand through his black hair, he moved it to the side, this time he began to focus on the chakra which may be needed in order to use this technique proficently. So with a subtle inhale followed by a deep exhale, he began to apply his focus to the user of the chakra, taking notice of her hint, about how this would need to be similar to that of the flame thrower. He smiled warmly.

His hands raised to chest level he decided this was as good a chance as any to begin to try the jutsu, first he took a deep breath followed by an exhale, deciding this was the time he needed to adequately prepare himself for this technique, before he slowly began to weave the handseals needed for the jutsu, slowly his chakra was beginning to mould. Before he raised two fingers to the side of his mouth.

Inhaling followed by a deep exhale, as flames were released from his lips, gathering into a large ball of fire which flew over the water before them, colliding with the surface of the water before dispersing. He took a deep breath, and smiled, as he spoke "Sounds like I did it?" Surprisingly, he didn't look anywhere near drained, perhaps his reserves also were higher than most.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he inhaled, this was definately another technique which would prove to be a lot more interesting than originally intended, he smiled warmly as he watched her, she had a wide-aresenal of techniques, and didn't seem to mind teaching which was definately a plus. But he was definately intrigued by this lack of seals this technique required. Definately a plus, so he was excited.

He inhaled followed by a brief exhale, but he figured since this technique lacked handseals in the long run it would be a lot quicker to learn or even a tad bit, so he cracked his knuckles, inhaling followed by a deep exhale. Slowly his hand moved to his side, taking another deep breath before exhaling and slowly he aimed to begin gathering chakra on his palm.

The formation of chakra upon his palm was slow and gradual, but slowly the chakra began to gather into that of a fireball on his palm, taking form, it slowly gathered into that of a ball of fire, which began burning around his palm before it ignited once again, he took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a brief exhale.

Before his hand shot forward, tossing it forward, it hit the water's surface before exploding and immediately it died out as he smiled lightly, he crouched down as he spoke "That's...Amazing...Thanks...Thanks so much." He stated lightly, watching the steam rise from the water.* - Mon Oct 12 14:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yes. - Mon Oct 12 14:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) whistled lightly as he took a deep breath, watching the ground rip up as the lightning passed through it. It definately looked like a powerful technique. And definately like something he desired to learn, he took a deep breath and sighed to himself,he found the jutsu fairly interesting so it was definately something he would use in battle if given the chance. 

So slowly he had decided that he would first work on getting the seals down before he even tried to gather the chakra needed for it. So he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he smiled. His hands slowly were raised to chest level, and he began slowly weaving the handseals taking a deep breath, he enjoyed this process greatly.

As he finished working on the handseals he decided it was time to begin working on the chakra, as he began to envision Hideki's flow of chakra as he would've attempted this jutsu, he figured it'd be adequate and serve it's purpose, he wasn't a your average Ninjutsu user, he did have some behind the scenes work.

So he had a somewhat easier time attempting this as he made a series of handseals once again and slowly he began to gather his chakra, allowing it to flow to his hands as he dropped them down to the ground touching the pavement, as lightning surged from his fingertips, surging through the ground before him.

"Wow...Definately a good skill."* - Mon Oct 12 15:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale as his hands were raised to chest level and slowly he began to weave a series of handseals after he had weaved the handseals his chakra began to form. Inhaling followed by a brief exhale. As he raised his thumb to his mouth, biting down as he drew blood before slamming it down against the ground, and as he did it a black seal appeared.

It spiraled outwards and there was a puff of smoke once the smoke cleared, sitting there was a small cat the bot set on his shoulder as he took a seat on the ground. Going into a meditative position, as he began to go over his techniques mentally simulating all of his techniques going from fire to lightning, his transition was smooth between each technique.

And slowly his transiton became smoother, his mind went over each seal, all the flow of chakra, he didn't waste any time moving and going over each technique he took a deep breath and sighed this was definately proficient when it came to training he didn't want to fall behind.

So he definately tried to continue, moving over each technique he inhaled followed by a deep exhale and as he was finished he scratched his chin, deciding it best to return to Hideki.* - Mon Oct 12 15:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath and slowly watched the bear, he wasn't about to simply charge in and attack the bear. He looked to Takeda as he spoke "How do you wish to go about this? I'd reccomend getting something to lure it away, It's better to avoid a fight afterall." He spoke in a low tone, he was whispering afterall didn't want to alert the bear to his presence. But either way, he inhaled followed by a deep breath.

His coal black eyes simply watched and waited.* - Mon Oct 12 15:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nods his head as he looked to Takeda as he scratched his chin he inhaled followed by a deep exhale as he then procceeded to whisper "You have any ideas?" He asked lightly, he wasn't seeing how they'd force a bear into a hole, at least not currently. But he had an idea, but he was also curious as to what Takeda's plan may've been, watching the beat as it moved around.* - Mon Oct 12 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he figured this was as good a time as any to broadcast his new summoning so his hands were raised to chest level he inhaled followed by a deep exhale as he spoke "We can use her for the decoy." He stated as he bit his thumb before slamming it against the ground causing a small seal to spiral outwards before a small cat was summoned "With her as the destruction we can both work to stun it." He stated lightly, the feline standing at his side before he began moving north expecting Takeda to come with him, he kept to the trees.* - Mon Oct 12 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he sent his summoning out from the cover, the small cat walked towards one of the holes the Bear had built more specifically, the one it had just dug, and stood on the opposing side of it as the Bear took a crap, the small cat opened it's maw and mewed loudly. In an attempt to get the bear's attention, as Index finished his circling aiming to wait for the bear to take the bait.* - Mon Oct 12 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as the bear's shit-cannon flew towards the cat, and ultimately the cat was hit and de-summoned almost instantly. He looked towards Takeda "This counts as attacking right?" He asked staring at the bear, a bit pissed that he now had a shit-faced cat.  But he didn't say anything after that, he was kind of ready to give this bear the work, no one threw shit at his cat, and got away with it...Besides Chuck Norris.* - Mon Oct 12 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was not about to be in the path of an angry bear, so he gathered his chakra into his palm, causing a ball of fire to began to form. He inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as the ball was sent towards the bear's legs. Attempting to knock it off balance before it hit Takeda, or rather before it reached him. He took a deep breath and sighed, his goal was obviously to trip the bear up, maybe Takeda would be able to finish it off.* - Mon Oct 12 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) jumped backwards as he blinked almost in disbelief of the Bear's agility, his hands moved to chest level, as he began to make five handseals. Before raising two fingers to the side of his mouth, inhaling followed by an exhale, flames were shot from his pursed lips, gathering into a ball of fire aimed at striking the bear. Or at the very least give Takeda time to retreat backwards.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) simply sighed as it seemed like his first mission was on the horizon and he simply began to walk away he definately knew this would be problematic and as such he desired to get this mission done as soon as possible, he inhaled followed by a brief exhale. Cracking his knuckles, he stared forward, he heard their barks and gnawing on the flesh of the deceased and as such he sighed this would be problematic. But they were dogs and animals, they would follow a preset path.

So he prepared himself, inhaling followed by a deep exhale. As he focused his eyes ahead of him, he reached for his holster and grabbed six Kunai. He figured if he could dispatch them quickly and efficently he wouldn't have a need to use chakra, so he prepared to focus. He wanted this to be easy, that would make his progression a lot better and more cost and time efficent.

So he sighed to himself, looking around as he took notice of his targets and sought higher ground, and taking one of the kunai he launched it from a tree, hitting one of the dogs on their necks, the poor thing slumped over, having been handled fairly quickly. The rest of the dogs turned their attention on the man, and he simply sighed as they ran to the tree.

Barking up at him he simply sighed, this made his job a lot easier, as he continued to simply throw Kunai down as they looked up, picking off each of the dogs one by one striking them one by one he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as the final Kunai met it's target and it slumped over, having successfully rid this location of the dogs.

He took a deep breath and sighed, that was already completed, so returning back to the Mizukage, he aimed to turn in his scroll, taking a deep breath as a hand was run through his hair, that was an easy mission but he already had a new one to undertake so he'd go and get on that.* - Mon Oct 12 20:54:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I know one other, but it is spcific to my fan, and unless you are trained in it's use the jutsu is pointless - Mon Oct 12 21:00:48 2015
