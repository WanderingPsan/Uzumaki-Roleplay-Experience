He slowly took a deep breath and sighed, deciding to pay out of pocket for a broom, he nodded his head as the shopkeeper asked for the money and handed it over without hesitation, and he cracked his knuckles, taking the new broom he approached the steps to the Kage's office.

Slowly he placed the bristles of the broom along the top of the steps, and slowly he began sweeping the dirt off of each of the stairs, knocking it over onto the stair below and repeating that process until all the dirt was knocked from the stairs into a pile which sat before the stairs, and eventually said dirt was swept into a pan before properly disposed of, he yawned lightly, after having disposed of the wate. The Broom was placed in the open.

It'd make it easier for whoever came after him to complete this mission because they wouldn't have to go and purchase or find the broom and as such once he was done he approached Shinjin once again, taking a knee before the Hokage, his head was bowed as he spoke "Mission complete, Lord Hokage."After that was said he simply awaited for the man to decide what to do with him next.* - Sun Oct 18 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) swallowed hard and nodded his head genuinely taken back, he wondered what had caused her to change so drastically in a short period of time, but he had assumed it was none of his business. So he took a deep breath and sighed it was fine, but this technique seemed to be on the more interesting side, taking note of her words as she spoke, and he carefully took notice of the seals she was performing. He swallowed hard and prepared.

Slowly his hands were raised to chest level, beginning to make a single seal, before transitioning into the next,  and repeating the process over and over again, trying to get the transition for each seal down to a timely fashion, he figured this would be fairly easy in the long run, once he had mastered it's use he predicted it'd become second nature to him, and that was swell. But for now he had to focus.

Eventually he felt as if he had gotten the seals down and as such it was time to focus on the part of their daily scheduled program which relied on the controling of his chakra, in which case he began to concentrate, as if he was performing the fireball jutsu, he slowly gathered his chakra allowing it to gather at his core, and swirl around in his gut, he focused on the task that was at hand, he figured he was still happy.

At least he was going to be able to make some progression and as such, he began to raise his hands to chest level and began to formulate the seals needed for that of the technique, shortly afterwards his chakra was gathered at his core, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, making sure he had the chakra correct, he raised two fingers to the side of his mouth, steadiying his aim forward, as he swallowed hard.

And eventually he exhaled, spewing flames from his mouth, which spread outwards before them, not touching anything just spewing forth, he had decided this was good, and as such he looked towards Lera and bowed his head "T-Thank you." He stated, still a bit perplexed by her new look, but he shook it off, he was happy she was assiting him.* - Sun Oct 18 13:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was definately a bit nervous as Lera entered commando mode, he felt his heart racing as things were being thrown at him. But slowly he watched as she reached for the hilt of her blade, holding it out with one hand he was surprised at how strong she had gotten but didn't say anything, he took a deep breath and nodded his head deciding this would be a valuable technique to use in the midst of battle so he had to focus, he inhaled followed by a brief exhale.

Slowly he reached for a kunai he held on person his only weapon, since he didn't rely on weaponry much at all, so when he held it by the hilt he took a deep breath and sighed it might end up being a long day today, but he shook his head inhaling followed by a deep exhale. Slowly he closed his eyes there was only a single part to this jutsu he had to understand and as such he only needed a small amount of time.

So as he held the kunai in his hand he had decided to begin working on the chakra flow, inhaling followed by a deep exhale as the chakra was gathered in his palm, slowly he closed his eyes before he began to slowly seep chakra into the Kunai which was held in his hand, and gradually the blade began to heat up in his grasp, before ultimately the bladed weapon began to ignite with flames that surged around it.

With a nod of his head, he looked to Lera, before ceasing the flow of chakra to the blade, he cracked his knuckles, since he had learned this one he figured that he was good, and smiled for a moment, taking a moment to rest and regain his breath.* - Sun Oct 18 14:01:48 2015

"A cup of coffee, Black. And a bowl of dumpling soup." He stated lightly.

Folding his menu he offered it to the waitress, looking to Amaterasu. He awaited her order.* - Sun Oct 18 16:03:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hmm.. - Sun Oct 18 17:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I have a technique I can show you. - Sun Oct 18 17:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Called Misty Flames Dance Jutsu. - Sun Oct 18 17:41:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he inhaled followed by a subtle exhale, his eyes focused on Hideki, watching as he began to formulate the handseals, his coal black eyes scanning the man's hands as he took in the process which was being demonstrated before him, before ultimately he nodded his head, he figured this would be fun, so he had decided to give it a shot cracking his knuckles, he inhaled followed by an exhale.

Hands were bought to chest level, and slowly he began to replicate the seals Hideki had just formed, forming them as well at a slower pace, eventually he attempted to replicate the flow of chakra  to no avail, and as such when he attempted to try the technique, nothing happened at all and he sighed himself,  he did in fact catch Hideki's matches.

But this time he felt as if he had a better understanding of the jutsu at hand and as such, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, with a gentle smile upon his face he prepared to try the next portion of the technique, hands raised he made a series of handseals, before inhaling followed by a deep exhale, as he did, a clear mist began to circle through the air, before he grabbed one of Hideki's matches. Lightning it, he tossed it into the mist causing the flames to ignite.* - Sun Oct 18 17:49:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Evening. - Sun Oct 18 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Anything I can do for you? - Sun Oct 18 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Be it a Massage, food, Or simple company. - Sun Oct 18 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. . . A massage would be fun, but that would make me far too lazy. - Sun Oct 18 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: As I have business I need to conduct. - Sun Oct 18 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Food sounds well, I suppose. - Sun Oct 18 18:10:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath, as he headed inside and slowly began preparing a simple dish for Asteroth. Slicing up some raw Salmon, as well as taking out some caviar, and sea-weed wraps, he began to prepare a fairly basic dish which would cost a fortune in a restaurant. Placing everything together neatly, he'd return, with a single plate for Asteroth, along with a fruit drink of his own creation, offering it to her. Hell, if she desired he'd stand there and hold the plate for her.

The drink was a mixture of several fruits and lightly sweeted with an umbrella on top.* - Sun Oct 18 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he figured she wouldn't enjoy eating something after he took a bite out of it. So what he did was he cut a piece off of the sushi, and raised it to his lips, chewing down on it as he spoke "I believe you'll enjoy it." He stated, before heading to the kitchen he began to clean stuff up, as he returned he took a seat across from her as he spoke:

"If you like it, I could make more later."* - Sun Oct 18 18:54:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) saw her smile and he himself smiled in response as he relaxed on the table, running a single hand through his black hair his eyes focused on her person. "Thank you, you don't know how much your words mean to me, M'lady." He stated warmly, but he carefully listened to her words as he spoke:

"If you don't have any more business to attend to we can try your massage, or handle any work you may have. Possibly go for a swim if you desire in the beach to the west." He offered lightly, taking a sip of a glass of water.* - Sun Oct 18 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Is that so? Will you be taking a group of guards with you? - Sun Oct 18 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. No need. - Sun Oct 18 20:52:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Omega**(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he ran back to one of the further carts in the caravan, and carefully he got her some water, which was chilled not icy.

While opening the fan with the other, and slowly his hand moved up and down fanning the woman as he kneeled.* - Sun Oct 18 21:17:52 2015
