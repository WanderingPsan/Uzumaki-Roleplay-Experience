<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hi everyone - Thu Nov 12 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) probably woke up at some point.* - Thu Nov 12 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked a few times, as he woke himself up, after a moment his gaze fell upon her. "Morning'."* - Thu Nov 12 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was a bit on the dazed side, and he was probably up against her, he had his head against her chest. (Last I remember) He was a bit groggy, as he spoke "Yeah...Very comfortable." He stated.* - Thu Nov 12 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: What did you, do while I was sleep? - Thu Nov 12 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I laid here, because  you were holding me. - Thu Nov 12 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked his arm moving from across her, as his gaze shifted. "S-Sorry about that...You could've pushed me off...I wouldn't have minded." As he thought to himself "S-Soft.."* - Thu Nov 12 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I know. - Thu Nov 12 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But you would have minded. - Thu Nov 12 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Would I? - Thu Nov 12 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Let's see. - Thu Nov 12 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) faked a pout, as he spoke "You're right, It's not as comfortable."* - Thu Nov 12 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) rested back against her as he took a deep breath before he asked,  "What would you like to do today? There are tests, but they're scheduled for later." He stated lightly.* - Thu Nov 12 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) thought about it for a second as he considered the options they had. "Well, there's a lake outside, I wouldn't mind taking you to.  Or an inside Hotsprings, we could find a game to play, look at flowers and maybe get you a few more variations.... I would invite you to eat,  but all I have are some people who wandered upon this location."* - Thu Nov 12 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked as she began to chuckle, it sent chills down his spine every time. But he'd probably heard worse, as he spoke "Out of those...Which would you like to do first?"* - Thu Nov 12 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "I'd have no problem teaching you...And...You're my friend not a science project."* - Thu Nov 12 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: A friend that isn't allowed to leave for four years? - Thu Nov 12 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: ....I guess that's so, but when life gives you lemons....You throw them away, because it didn't give you sugar. - Thu Nov 12 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: ---Bad joke, Not just in taste, It was horrible. - Thu Nov 12 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...I don't get it. - Thu Nov 12 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: What I basically meant was... - Thu Nov 12 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: This isn't the best of situations. - Thu Nov 12 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: But we can take this time to make it sweeter by doing something else. - Thu Nov 12 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: More enjoyable. - Thu Nov 12 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Thu Nov 12 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: So...What would you like to do? - Thu Nov 12 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Learn to swim like I said. - Thu Nov 12 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked she had said that, What was he thinking? But he sat up, and slowly he stood from the bed, he didn't have a need for his armor so he left it, along with his weapons, but walking to the other side of the room. He extended his hand to her "Shall we then?"* - Thu Nov 12 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was considering changing her clothing situation---Joking, but as she took his hand, he began to lead her through an expansive hallway up to a large stairway, which he followed all the way up, before reaching the surface, the guards stood at attention, as they walked past. And opened the door to the base once they had entered, once that was accomplished, he led her to a location in the woods which happened to be the proud owner of a beach-like area.* - Thu Nov 12 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) scratched his cheek as he spoke "I suppose you're right, It is more of an ocean." He scratched his cheek, he looked at the area before he asked "You speak to plants, Right?  But can you also feel where plants are?" He was making small talk before he prepared to hop in.* - Thu Nov 12 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head as he spoke "You get more interesting the more I listen to you." He spoke with a light smile, as he looked at the water which was clear "Shall we begin then---You don't have a swimsuit...do you?"* - Thu Nov 12 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked as he noticed her pulling off the dress, and he swallowed hard, watching as the dress was moved up unveiling her legs, followed by her sex, stomach, and finally her breasts. And a faint blush, caressed his cheeks. "N-Nevermind.." He stated, as he gave her one more look from head to toe before his gaze was averted. Slowly he began to undo the top of his shirt, removing it, it was laid on the ground beside him. Before he undid his belt buckle, and placed his pants atop of his shirt, and finally he removed his boots. He was fairly fit, having noticable muscle tone. But not extreme amounts, though he was still wearing his boxers. 

A single hand was raised to his cheek before subtly scratching. "S-Shall we?"* - Thu Nov 12 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her as she stepped into the water, and slowly he stepped in behind her, feeling the coldness of the water against his  flesh. His blush had only intensified as a result of her staring as he undressed, he seemed to be easily flustered. As he looked at her, he didn't have to worry about her being afraid of the water, so that saved him some trouble, he didn't think he had to worry about her drowning either, but slowly he stated "Give me both your hands." He stated, as he stood in front of her, he offered her both of his hands.* - Thu Nov 12 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her, as he reached to grasp her hands as he spoke "Let your upper body follow me, and your legs float behind you. Keep your head up." He stated, as he looked at her he contemplated the question as he spoke "It isn't. It's Yosuke." He stated lightly, he couldn't help the curious glances towards her as he helped her swim.* - Thu Nov 12 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) smiled a bit as he spoke "You could say that." He stated warmly, as he did in fact lead her around the water, after he felt like she had gotten a feel for it he'd state. "Start kicking your legs, up and down, alternate between them. And try to maintain a steady pace." He stated.* - Thu Nov 12 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) stopped for the briefest of moments, as he spoke "I'm not sure, I've been acting so long. Not sure if I remember what I really am like." He stated in an almost defeated tone. But he didn't seem to actually mind, but slowly he'd say "We're going to try getting you to wade in the water, try to stand on your feet." If she tried, she'd probably notice she'd need to stand on the tip of her toes to remain above water.* - Thu Nov 12 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) actually laughed a bit as he spoke "The goal is to stay above the water, so try moving your arms and legs in -controlled- circles. Keep yourself above." He of course released her hands so she could try.* - Thu Nov 12 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) smiled as he spoke "That's great." He stated, swimming a bit backwards as he spoke, "Try to come to me now, kick your legs like before. But this time move your  arms." He demonstrated the procedure with how she should move her arms.* - Thu Nov 12 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Move them h--oh. - Thu Nov 12 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) moved over to her, and submerged himself in front of her holding his breath, as he aimed to guide her upwards by finding the space between her arms and pulling her up as he spoke "You have to keep your head up, face your destination. Try to stay above the water instead of going down." Not letting her go just yet.* - Thu Nov 12 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) contemplated it as he spoke "I suppose you don't have to,  bur Most people can't hold their breath forever, At tops they can only hold their breath for a minute or two. For the sake of your personas, It may be best you know this, You'll blend in easier." He stated lightly, looking into her eyes, but something about teaching her how to swim was getting to him.* - Thu Nov 12 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) thought about what she asked him this time, He looked at her as he spoke "What you've seen is probably...Part of the bigger picture, All lies contain truth. But before I started playing this 'game'... I don't honestly remember, much before it." He stated, he had been playing it for a while ,this game of 'life'. After a moment he released her hands, before taking a few steps back "Try again."* - Thu Nov 12 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked into her eyes as she swam closer, and he smiled as she began to tread in front of him, and he laughed lightly before he replied.  "That's for you to decide, Ume." He stated lightly.* - Thu Nov 12 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But...how can I decide what is a lie or not from you? - Thu Nov 12 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I suppose..Through interacting and doing things. - Thu Nov 12 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Then you can formulate your own thoughts on whether my feelings, what I've done and said are lies. - Thu Nov 12 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But you said that it was a persona. - Thu Nov 12 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Then...How about I show you the real me? - Thu Nov 12 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That would be good, if you want to. - Thu Nov 12 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) would slowly move to wrap his arm around her waist, aiming to pull her in closer, confident in his ability to tread in place with a single arm. He'd pull her to the point their bodies were touching, as he spoke  "You asked me before....If I loved you. But....I'm not sure what love is, nor what it feels like. It's foreign territory." He admitted, staring her in the eyes.* - Thu Nov 12 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) felt her body against his own and he felt the reappearance of his blush,  "I don't think love, is something that could happen in a short period of time. And if it does, I don't believe it'll last long." He stated, staring into her eyes. His own were as dark as the night. His palm found her lower back, resting there feeling the softness of her skin coupled with the wetness which surrounded it.* - Thu Nov 12 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) stared into her eyes as he spoke "Three months---Four if you count this one even though I haven't seen her." He stated, his hand slowly drifting lower, aiming to test his luck, as it followed the curvature of her butt, before moving back and forth, his heart raced. As he looked at her, he felt the temperature of his body rising despite being in the middle of the water. * - Thu Nov 12 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head "Yeah, it hasn't been that long. Though...It felt like a lot longer  at certain points." He stated with a warm smile, she'd probably feel something hard poking at her through the fabric of his boxer's, his hand lightly squeezed on her butt. As he spoke to her.* - Thu Nov 12 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head as he spoke "Yeah...It was fun." He admitted with a smile of remembrance. His hand returning to the rubbing motions from before, and the bulge only increasing in size. But with a sudden moment, he moved onto his back, aiming to pull her atop of him, taking advantage of her light weight, he didn't see an issue, but as a precaution chakra was sent beneath him to make sure he didn't end up going beneath the surface unexpectedly. Had he succeeded, she'd be either laying or sitting atop of him.* - Thu Nov 12 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "I'm not sure...I try to be who she needs me to be, ...What she needs me to be." He stated, with a sigh, as he continued his process of rubbing and groping her butt. As his second hand found her back, moving up and down with subtle motions.* - Thu Nov 12 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "I don't know...I thought it was what I had to do...." He commented beginning to realise how troubling these boxers were becomming. He shifted some beneath her, his bulge pressed against her mound, as he spoke "But maybe you're right...But I feel like you Ume, aren't blank...Or maybe it's your blankness, which allows you to be so colorful."* - Thu Nov 12 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) smiled as he looked at her as he spoke "It was pretty cute, how you acted--Never seen you look or act so agitated." He spoke with a smile, both hands now resting on her butt.* - Thu Nov 12 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) contemplated that as he spoke "I guess I might have a soft spot for them, It was pretty interesting. The thought of you doing it was definately, intriguing." He stated, by this time he realised it was probably unbearable to remain in his boxers, he didn't know why he let himself get to this point at all. * - Thu Nov 12 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) bit his bottom lip, as he replied, "She's just about as tall as you....Her hair is just about the same color as yours.. She's beautiful, she wears a lot of body suits, along with the armor I bought her...She really liked that armor. She's more into fighting than romantic things though." He stated, closing his eyes as he focused on what he was thinking about.* - Thu Nov 12 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked, as she spoke, and suddenly the similarities set in and he bit his bottom lip as he spoke. "No....I like you, because you are you..." He stated, though part of his brain told him that was true, he didn't want to believe it he couldn't.* - Thu Nov 12 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) opened his eyes as he looked at her, he released a breath he had been holding for a while as he spoke..."I'm...stupid, aren't I?" He stated,one of his hands moving from her butt to his forehead. He couldn't believe what he was doing, "I'm...really stupid."* - Thu Nov 12 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) sighed as he spoke "Yeah...Probably...This is one of those times I'm going to apologize for being an idiot."* - Thu Nov 12 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) gasped when she moved causing him to bite down on his bottom lip, what little bit he had calmed down had instantly been reversed. As he spoke "That doesn't change the fact, That you're my friend...That has -nothing- to do with her....Ume, no matter what form you take. You will always be someone precious to me, Owari, Ume--Or anyone else...And when you have your feelings...I'll do whatever I can to make up for this."* - Thu Nov 12 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked as he spoke "Aijisai-san..." He muttered under his breath as he closed his eyes, he had never asked for the name of the form he had killed, and that hurt him a bit, but he listened to her words replying with a "I see." His hands resting on her lower back, holding her tightly against his body.* - Thu Nov 12 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her as he looked up to the sky as he spoke "M...Maybe...It would be..." He spoke lightly, looking at 'Ume', he sighed. He was really pitiful at times.* - Thu Nov 12 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he spoke "C-Change..." He didn't want to associate the two of them, it wasn't right for either of them.* - Thu Nov 12 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) closed his eyes when instructed, he swallowed hard, he wasn't sure what to expect, he felt Ume's body beginning to change atop of him. He had honestly no clue what to expect, but once he felt the change stop. He waited patiently for Ume's permission to re-open.* - Thu Nov 12 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) opened his eyes, and his jaw pracctically dropped. His cheeks turning as red as tomatos, as he saw the contrast between her red hair, and pale skin. Her pink lips, and curvy figures, she'd no doubt be able to hear the melody in which his heart beat to. "B-Beautiful..." Was all he managed to get out, he was definately awe-stricken by this form she had taken, and he was practically speechless as his eyes moved over her form.* - Thu Nov 12 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head, but if that wasn't enough confirmation, his bulge had almost seemed to reach a new height of arousal. His eyes caressed her frame as he spoke "W-Wow..."* - Thu Nov 12 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) bit down on his lip as he felt her adjust her body atop of him, he almost whimpered how unbearable it was getting inside his boxers, why he wore it he wasn't sure but he heard her speak, as he spoke "It's...It's possible.."* - Thu Nov 12 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: N-Not quite... - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I-I'm...confined. - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Confined? - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm just laying on top of you. - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And you put me here. - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: N-No...In...m-my boxers. - Thu Nov 12 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That's a problem? - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Y-Yeah. - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Y-You won't mind...I-If I t-take it off? - Thu Nov 12 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...why would I? - Thu Nov 12 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) would swallow hard, as his chakra flow lessened, and he fell into the water. "G-Good point.."" His thumbs found the edges of his boxers, and slowly they were pulled off revealing him to all to see beneath the water. As he looked at Ume, he blushed fairly hard, it could be obvious he was very aroused by this new form, and his gaze shifted off.* - Thu Nov 12 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her briefly, as he swallowed hard "Y-Your staring, is e-embarrassing.." He stated lightly.* - Thu Nov 12 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Is that why you always look away? - Thu Nov 12 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he spoke "M-Man, t-this is uncomfortable." He spoke, his hands going to cover himself, though unneeded at this point, and not covering much.* - Thu Nov 12 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) stepped in closer to Ume as he spoke "I-It's t-to late for that reaction now.." He stated, looking at her body, once again before his gaze was shifted to her face, "I'm not sure...I-I can make it back to t-the base without h-handling this." He stated, he was quite litterally saying the first thing that came to mind, which made him seem idiotic in hindsight.* - Thu Nov 12 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) swallowed hard, he was moving to fast, way to fast, and he felt as if that if he continued with this pace he'd end up getting burned, but ultimately he took a deep breath as he said "T-Tomorrow....I have to show you s-something..." He stated as he suddenly moved to the side of the water, he was incredibly flustered, and the conversation they had; had gotten to him. He needed to think.* - Thu Nov 12 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) wakes up wherever he had called his bed for the night, he wondered if Ume was up.* - Thu Nov 12 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Mornin'....Ume. - Thu Nov 12 20:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her and sighed briefly, before takinga  deep breath in an attempt to calm himself as he spoke "They'd like you to wear the gown again, no under clothes this time." He stated lightly, his eyes were averted to the side. As to give her, her privacy. He didn't comment on what she had said though.* - Thu Nov 12 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head once she sat down, he was resisting the urge to steal a glance when she removed the red dress. But slowly he moved, calling for the scientist, and this time, a single woman came, perhaps in her mid to late fourties. She had chestnut brown hair color, with piercing green eyes, with a knock on the door she entered bowing to both of those already present before she approached Ume, as she spoke "I''m Doctor Yatsuhina." She stated, before adding "I'm going to run a few tests if that's fine?"* - Thu Nov 12 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) | The woman smiled a bit before she spoke "We tend to switch it up every so often ." She paused before she added "Just to make it a bit more exciting." She added a warm, almost motherly smile, before she looked at Ume, she spoke "Lay on your back please?" And with that Index stood, heading to the opposing side of the bed he didn't want to interfere.* - Thu Nov 12 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||The woman looked at Ume as she laid upon the bed, slowly approaching the girl, she spoke "My hands may be a bit cold." But slowly she'd aim to raise the bottom of the gown just a bit, moving her hand beneath the gown until it rested on Ume's lower stomach she'd simply speak "Could you take a deep breath for me then cough?" She figured there was no need for this test, but she desired to cover all basis.* - Thu Nov 12 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||Contemplated what she said but she spoke "That's fine then.  But tell me, is there any part of your structure you can't control?" She asked lightly, before she spoke "Flip over please?"* - Thu Nov 12 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) | Looked at her curiously as she stated "That must take some amazing amount of control, I'm envious." She joked lightly, before reaching to undo the bindings had Ume tied them to expose her back side, had she not she'd simply aim to part the back of the gown, before her hands, would move to the back of the girl's neck, looking at where the hair was connected to her head as she asked curiously. "Are you able to control parts of your body that're detached?"* - Thu Nov 12 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||Was astonished by the information Ume was giving away, and her eyes scanned the woman's back, which was most likely still blemish free. Before her hands moved to Ume's rear, she'd aim to slightly spread, her cheeks, as she spoke "The detail is pretty amazing, I noticed the only hair is on your face..Is it safe to assume you can grow it elsewhere?" She asked while looking at where she had just spread before her eyes drifted to her sex and down her leg. She was fairly intrigued, but slowly she walked over to the cart to retrieve a few tings.

"Does your body produce any fluids?"* - Thu Nov 12 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was trying his hardest not to steal a glance, though it was pretty hard for him, by some stroke of luck he had managed not to. ||The scientist nodded as she spoke "I know some of these questions were already asked, It's just reassuring to ask them yourself." She explained, before she spoke "Could you stand up for me?Place both feet together?"* - Thu Nov 12 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was still resisting the urge to take a glance.|| The Doctor slowly moved behind Ume, her hands finding the space between her arms. And she  guided Ume's arms up, until her hands had rested upon the pit of the girl's arms. After a moment, her hand would move down the center of the girl's back, as if feeling for a spine. She'd easily come to find out not one exists,  as she spoke "Extend your arms forward, and bend over to touch your toes."* - Thu Nov 12 21:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) took notice of this, and immediately his face turned red, and he swallowed hard. His gaze shifted, to the side, eagerly desiring to steal another glance but he willed himself not to. || She spoke "A little bit of both." Stated the doctor, her eyes exploring Ume's form, as she decided to ask. "Are you able to extend your limbs? I know you can modify your height, but are their limits?"* - Thu Nov 12 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||Contemplated Ume's words as she then proceeded to nod her head "Your ability to transform into others...Is it based off of the forms of other people? Or purely imagination. Does the pigmentation in your skin have limits? Could you make your skin color blue?"  She took notice of the lack of a scent, but she was comming closer to the end of her session for today, tomorrow would begin the testing of chemical responses.* - Thu Nov 12 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||Nodded once as she spoke "We'll begin testing injections starting tomorrow. By any chance is there anything you'll react to that you know of?" She asked curiously, before heading towards her cart and began putting things away.* - Thu Nov 12 22:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) watched as the scientist exited the room, he scratched his cheek as he looked to Ume, as he spoke "I-Is s-something wrong?" Still a bit flustered from seeing her bent over.* - Thu Nov 12 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) (*Ouichi, Ryutaro watched as the scientist exited the room, he scratched his cheek as he looked to Ume, as he spoke "I-Is s-something wrong?" Still a bit flustered from seeing her bent over.*)* - Thu Nov 12 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) shrugged as he spoke "I'm not sure...Not at all,  But I don't believe they've ever seen anyone like you before." He stated, as he aimed to move around to sit beside her.* - Thu Nov 12 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So they are idiots in other words? - Thu Nov 12 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: If they haven't seen anything like me shouldn't they be in here twenty four seven poking and prodding me? - Thu Nov 12 22:27:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) took a deep breath, he had been comming along with his training, and he was happy about this. He smiled warmly, he was making progress on this 'Release' of his own. It'd be done in only a  few days, he'd have created something knew...Something original. A power of his on, it was within his grasp, he was able to reach it.

He inhaled followed by a deep exhale he was unsure about a lot of things in his life, but the one thing he was sure about was that the power was comming. It would make him...A King...a god amongst men..It was inevitable, and it was comming, he just needed to give it one final push, one more shove in the right direction.

This new element..."Wood...Release." He muttered, he was on the verge of something great, but even with greatness on the horizon, he wasn't sure about his feelings, Ume...Katsune, who did he care about..? Or was it equal for both? He wasn't sure, but he took a deep breath, and inhaled followed by a subtle exhale.

With these emotions swirling around in his mind, he was unsure about his future, and that hurt him. But even so, he was happy, excited, and looking forward to his progression, there'd be a while before he actually decided upon a technique which would follow the release known as  'Wood', he had already begun plotting out several possible scenarios.

A single hand was moved through his hair, he stared forward. There was definately endless potential that lay before him,he could become a monster, or a god. He'd be unbeatable, unstoppable...That would be perfect, and it excited him, but he began tof ocus, concentrating, on what was to come in the future, but for now he inhaled followed by a deep exhale as he took out a book.

And slowly he began to read. About the World Tree and Norse Mythology "In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is the world tree. Yggdrasil is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Yggdrasil is an immense ash tree that is central and considered very holy."

" The sir go to Yggdrasil daily to hold their courts. The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations; one to the well Urarbrunnr in the heavens, one to the spring Hvergelmir, and another to the well Mmisbrunnr. Creatures live within Yggdrasil, including the harts Dinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Durarr, the giant in eagle-shape Hraesvelgr, the squirrel Ratatoskr and the wyrm Nhggr."

He found this idea of norse Mythology to be pretty appealing the idea intrigued him greatly, he had known that this was a religion which was appearing as of late." Scholarly theories have been proposed about the etymology of the name Yggdrasil, the potential relation to the trees Mmameir and Lrar, and the sacred tree at Uppsala."

After he had finished reading he took a deep breath and slowly approached a plant, extending his hand he began to gather his chakra before sending it into the plant, taking appropriate measures to mix his Earth and Water chakra, and slowly the plant began to grow.* - Fri Nov 13 00:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) approaches the field, his eyes shifted about the area before he noticed a figure before him which he indentified as being a female "Hello?"* - Fri Nov 13 20:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked as he recognized the figure, their gaze met Rymei's as he spoke "I've met you before...The Gezo Tournament wasn't it?" He asked curiously, after hearing her words he asked "Is something wrong?" Taking notice of the tone.* - Fri Nov 13 20:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) took a deep breath and lept backwards, a sizable distance, as he looked at her hands and the position they moved to..."Is....Something...wrong?" He asked, he was getting closer to take up her offer on leaving.* - Fri Nov 13 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) stared at her, as he silently cursed. "I'm sorry, If you wait a bit longer...I can help you. I'm unable to now." Though he swallowed hard, seeing her groping her own chest, if he didn't know better he would've been stunned, by the sight. But his hands moved to chest level, aiming to make a single handseal, once performed he'd vanish from his position, happy he had taken notice of such a thing, he felt bad for leaving her, but he wasn't sure he could actually handle her by himself, at least not safely. Upon vanishing he'd appear some distance away.* - Fri Nov 13 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) took a deep breath, as he found his gaze locked onto her breasts, almost hypnotized. He wasn't able to move, he took a deep breath. As suddenly his chakra flow began to change, his control truly was one of a kind. He was also fairly smart, that was definately a plus, he was able to deduce the possibility of a genjutsu almost deceptively quick, and as such his mode of response was different. He lept backwards  once again attempting to keep his focus on Rymei. 

"Remember me..? I'm Index. We met at the tournament, Try to calm down." He stated, aiming to get through to her.* - Fri Nov 13 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he saw her comming towards him, his eyes turned a scarlet red color, as his flow of chakra was immediately shifted. He wasn't playing around any longer, black chakra began seeping from his pores. As she first approached him.

-----Meant for last turn, But I'm strategist so I can get an extra turn anyway.

The moment she charged towards him his chakra flared around him, making him virtually weightless, as he took flight with approximately the same speed Rymei was approaching him from, she had revealed her tactics. But at this point, his mind was on the hazier side of things. Slipping from the edge of conciousness. His now slitted pupils, had three tomoe swirling around the pupils. Focusing on Rymei's person.

"Calm. Down." He almost sneered out. Remaining hovering in the sky.* - Fri Nov 13 20:55:40 2015
