<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm sorry, about leaving so suddenly. - Fri Nov  6 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sat there on the ground and slowly he closed his eyes, these last few days...He'd come to a painful breakthrough, and he decided to meditate upon it. It was becomming a pass time in recent days. He inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as his legs were crossed and his eyes closed, slowly he began to focus his breathing. Taking deep but slow breaths, he calmed himself. Over these last few days..He realised something.

The young male had realised...This world, was broken, it was dark, and horrible. It was trash. He realised this was a product of his ancestor's failures, and he realised he had no write to complain about it, since he wasn't doing anything to help. He realised...There were no such things as good and evil, the concept had such a blurred line, he considered them one in the same. His dream had always been to become a hero.

There were no heroes...He realised, Heroes were only people who were more screwed in the head than the rest of them, there wouldn't be a happy ending to the story of this world. He had shed his desire to be a hero, instead, he had decided to take on another role, which was just for him. He wanted to make a tradgedy, he acknowledged, and accepted the world around him, but he knew he couldn't change it.

Heroes decided to go against the flow, to challenge Authority, but he'd...He'd become the authority, he'd go with the flow of the world. And wouldn't seek to change it's course for the better, or for the worst. He had decided, that this world, would be it's best if such a state was maintained, Balance...Was what he desired. He wanted to be the one to control this, to tip the scales.

Create Balance.

He would be both the judge, and the jury, he'd crucify those so-called heroes. But he knew, that he himself would be crucified by his peers, not for being a Hero...But for being Tragic, he was choosing to suffer for what he had decided was his path. It was because of his flaws...The flaws he embraced which had shed light down this dark alley that he now traversed. He wasn't on the brink of insanity, he had dipped into it's depths.

And he felt like he had finally become sane, he felt the world around him was insane...Such concepts...Social Norms. He realised..They all followed the Theory of differential association, and because of that...They were easily manipulated, they desired to go against the flow...But they failed to realise...Going against the flow, is simply going -with- the flow...Because there was no flow. 

Humans defined the flow, therefore they set their own limitations.. He knew...Humans were weak, they desired to be controlled...He'd be the king in this game of chest, even if he had to work his way from the pawn, he'd grasp this ideal....Of natural order...And he'd destroy it, along with the Humans who grasped onto it's concept.* - Fri Nov  6 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath he had quite a few things he had desired to learn as of today, so he sat down on the ground and inhaled followed by a brief exhale as he slowly reached into his back pouch and grasped his scroll, slowly he inhaled followed by a deep exhale. As he slowly began to read the scroll at hand, he realised this would be a long process, but eventually he would get to it, he sighed to himself.

Sitting upon the ground he'd slowly read about the technique known as Chakra enhanced strength, he figured this would be a fairly interesting technique to employ  in battle. So he hoped he'd be able to learn it in a reasonable amount of time, he sighed, taking a deep breath before yawning, his eyes scanned the page, finding it to be a lot harder than originally anticipated, he wondered how to accomplish it.

He was  actually wondering what kind of person came up with this technique, part of him felt like it was some kid that was being bullied that came up with the idea, he thought it to be so, he wasn't sure though he wondered where it first arose. He had an idea it was Sunagakure he did hear about such a thing a while back, so he laughed a bit, as he continued reading it would have numerous implications both in and out of battle.

He was making great process on the technique, which was definately good, and as he read he considered his own abilities, and he desired to get stronger so that he wouldn't fail himself, that would be a harder task than most, but he was prepared for it. He was relaxed and focused, and he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, he needed this, he needed to focus, and prepare, to stay in the game he had to.

He knew if he fell behind he'd die, and that was something he did -not- want to experience. So he had a single choice, and that was to keep moving forward and not stop, he would succeed in accomplishing what he was doing, that was his goal he had to, be strong enough to protect the one he loved, he was weak, to women, booze, and other things, but even in his weakness he desired to find strength.* - Fri Nov  6 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as he sat there meditating, there was one thought that kept passing through his mind...The people...The person he hated most on this planet...The one who made his blood boil...That led him...To this point, the one that caused Hideki to commit suicide...Ushinawa to do the same.. He felt his heart racing his blood boiling....He had lost track of his goal...Of why he was doing this...Why he even stood here today.

His feelings had side tracked him from the Two he wanted...To kill...He wanted revenge on.."Xavier....And Xeno." Just thinking their names, caused his heart to throb, as he recalled the victims of their orders, he recalled the book he had found..The notes, that showed their crusade, his mind was clouded. His breathing heavied, his fists clenched as they remained on his lap.

"They...Forced...Hideki to kill himself....Out of fear...The reason...I wanted to become a shinobi....The reason...I survived..Kept moving forward...Was to spill their blood."

The pain in his chest was almost unimaginable, he couldn't help replaying the scene of Hideki's death in his mind. "They...Killed Hideki....Ushinawa.." He felt his hands going numb from how hard his hands were clenched, Lera's....Lera's face..."If they....were dead....Lera...wouldn't have lost her Girlfriend...Hideki would still be alive....Ortho wouldn't be on this suicidal quest....Nina wouldn't be left without a family....Without her brother."

He kept repeating the phrase "If only...They were dead." In his mind, he felt a certain clarity in his mind....All of his thoughts stopped. And his reasons for choosing this path, joining the Gezo....Was all..To get closer...Closer to the source of his hatred, The source of his pain...The pain of others. 

"Xavier....Must die."* - Fri Nov  6 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: . - Fri Nov  6 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as he sat on the ground, now he had established a clear target...Someone...who he hated...That he desired revenge on for killing Hideki....He was powerless against them as he was now. The anger, it cleared his mind...It was a unique sensation...He felt the tension...He just didn't care,  he wanted their blood. He wanted to rectify the wrongs they had done.

He wanted to let Hideki rest at peace..But as long as they lived, that was impossible. He hated them, he despised them, he knew the Gezo had done good. But they had also done great evil, and it hit home, his Sensei, brother...The loved ones of his friends, they had all experienced great loss. Which he felt outweighed the small amounts of good he felt the Gezo had created.

"Xavier...Is a parasyte.." He thought to himself, but he inhaled sharply, and calmed himself, he needed to work...To get to a point where he could challenge them, and wouldn't just end up as another casket in the ground, he didn't want to be another number, or statistic. He wanted, to be the one that made Xavier and Xeno pay for their sins. He couldn't save Hideki, but he'd sure as hell Avenge him.* - Fri Nov  6 04:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) heard the reports circling that Ortho was dead, he had...Just seen him..A few days ago...He was in perfect health, and he fell to his knees. His heart began racing, as he heard the news. He..couldn't believe it..What about Nina...Ume? He sat down to brace himself, his chest hurt, "He can't be..." He muttered under his breath, as he took a deep breath, trying to brace his nerves, but he noticably shook.

"I'm...Losing...everyone."

Hideki, Sunagakure, Kilm...And Now Ortho. All gone, killed by some freak of nature...He was seeing the people he trusted and cared for the most...Ripped away from him. And it hurt, he heard that the person who killed Ortho was the Mizukage...And he began to driect his hate towards that person...Who had killed yet another of his brothers.

His heart raced, and felt like it occasionally skipped beats, he bit his bottom lip. Trying to resist the urge to scream out, he was too late...Again..He wasn't able to save Ortho, nor Hideki, he had failed Nina, and Ume, and it hurt him. He was to slow, he wasn't there, but the man...Who killed Ortho was alive, he was angry he wanted revenge...To give Nina justice...He needed to make sure she knew this wouldn't be allowed to stand.* - Fri Nov  6 05:18:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll see you soon. - Fri Nov  6 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath and decided it was time to get back to training but first he had decided there was something he needed to do before he actually got to hardcore training, he had a scroll he desired to learn, so as he sat there, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, focusing on the scroll he had just removed from his pocket, and slowly he began to read the text which was oh-so- beautifully writeen upon this scroll. He smiled to himself as he focused.

He realised this was a genjutsu, but oddly he was okay with that, he didn't seem to mind that. But he surely wouldn't tell Katsune about it or she'd kill him. So this Genjutsu would be his little secret but while he aimed to learn it, he'd begin mentally training his own techniques, he needed to make sure he was able to hold his own, he needed to. So he took a deep breath and smiled as he began to focus.

He'd probably be able to see Katsune soon enough, he was happy, he would survive this without cheating or doing anything exceedingly questionable. So he was happy, he had a girl, and it was Katsune, he wouldn't trade her for the world, so he continued to focus, and simply smiled to himself, this would be fun, extremely so. He was enjoying this task of his it was good for training, and so he continued doing it.

He assumed he was making progress, so he didn't slow down, he was doing something that's for sure and as he sat here practicing the techniques mentally, he began thinking of various things that would allow him to utilize this in battle. Both strategically and other things,  he had quite a few ideas, and he nodded his head, he felt as if he was prepared for what was to come, so all he had to do was brace himself.

Finally he felt like he had a firm grasp on the technique at hand, so he inhaled followed by a brief exhale. He felt like he was doing fairly good in terms of getting stronger, he had successfully learned all he could so he was prepared to finish the process of mastering what it was he learned.* - Fri Nov  6 12:59:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) farts.* - Fri Nov  6 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) raised his hands together at chest level, his hands began to weave a series of handseals honestly he was fed up with this. He had watched...For too long, he wasn't sure who Ketsu was, he had been unable to get a actual view of his face, he didn't actually care. If he was another snake summoner, he was on his list, and that was problematic. He also summoned Manda, upon completing the seals. His hand was raised to his mouth, before slammed against the ground.

"Manda, Over here now." 

The male commanded, as a seal spiraled outwards from his point of contact, the Giant snake known as Manda would more than likely be forcefully summoned beneath the male. "I'm....tired of losing people. It'd easier if everyone else, just learns their place...And dies." He muttered, his gaze was cold, and around his body, was an armor as red as blood, his hair hung low over his face.

If it didn't the look in his eyes would probably send chills down the spines of most people. He was annoyed, he was angry, He needed....To make sure Hideki's will, remained in check, he needed to prevent the loss of another friend.* - Fri Nov  6 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as the snake fell limp beneath his body, as per Ketsu's seal. He was left several feet in the air, in which case he lept from his perch. His hands moved together to make a single seal, and his shadow which would no doubt be elongated assuming the sun was behind him, forward. Shot out towards the Anbu Agent, who wasn't paying attention to him and by extension left himself open, the shadow raced forward aiming to connect to the Agent's own.

In which case, had he been caught, Index would attempt to take control of the man's body. In which case, had he succeeded,  because Why would he be looking  at the ground behind him. In which case, he'd aim to manipulate the man's body to reach for his holster.* - Fri Nov  6 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt the wind surge through the area which would without a doubt cause him to raise his hands for a moment, causing ANbu to mimic his reactions. But afterwards, he'd mimic the throwing action. Forward, aiming to make the Anbu launch his tanto at one of the Earthern clones. With a swift motion, he mimiced the 'dispel',  seal. Which showed his knowledge of the technique in use, which at this moment was the clone technique. After he had made ANBU dispel his clones, Index would begin walking forward. Which would in turn cause the Anbu to walk towards him.

"Ortho, You are all....Stupid. You want peace, you desire to stand up for the morales, of those who are dead.  But they are dead for a -reason-, their morales weren't correct."

He looked at the Anbu Agent, as he drew near, "You my friend....I pity you." Stated the male, as he reached into his own holster for a Kunai, in which he'd hold in his hand, his armor was looking more and more like the color of blood. He extended his hand forward aligning the blade with the Agent's heart. 

"Wrong place, Wrong time. You will be able to understand, that there are no heroes. You were misguided and stupid, A child....It's a shame you were only able to find this out with your death. As if on cue, Lightning began to shroud his armor, zapping the air around him. Before it began to gather at the edge of his Kunai. "Exit stage Left." He stated as he prepared to drive the blade into the man's chest.* - Fri Nov  6 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt his arm being repelled by some unknown force, instinctively, he'd raise his arms to cover himself as he felt the first barrage managing to cover himself up before he was hit by the brunt. Probably not being knocked back as far as the male would've hoped, since Manda was right behind him. He'd probably hit the snake's body, his armor taking a brunt of the damage dealt to him.

He'd feel a lot of pain going through his body, but he had in fact survived the attacked, which was a definate start. The technique maybe not doing what it was intended for, he wasn't sure if Mizumi would've been released, but he'd probably replicate his actions of falling, which would make him hit the ground in front of him, But the wind probably wouldn't have blurred their shadows, or created some kind of distortion so he was probably still caught.

After a moment, he'd attempt to stand, and had he been able to his hands would be raised forward at  Mizumi, as he simply spoke "Two can play that game." As flames, began to gather forward rapidly along his palms, before being sent towards Mizumi in a spiraling vortex like fashion. Aiming to take the male in it's confines with a single motion.

He was in fact aching, but he'd definately survive. If it wasn't for the armor he'd probably be in a lot more pain than he currently was.* - Fri Nov  6 22:35:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was knocked back, by the force of the explosion from his side, knocked against the wall of the building. He suggered minor damage, he shook his head,  he was dazed and his ears were ringing. He supposed he didn't have to worry about the clones anymore either, but he shook his head, this was definately...Problematic, he struggled to get to his feet, only stumbling which would probably cause Mizumi to mimic the same attempt. But he was dazed for a bit. 

He needed to end this, and soon. There was a bit of blood rolling from his forehead as per the force.* - Fri Nov  6 23:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looks to Ortho, his eyes were focused on his person. Piercing holes into his soul, he felt his fists unconciously clench. He wanted....Blood, Ketsu had done something far worse than dying on him. He had betrayed his trust, and that hurt a lot, He couldn't trust Ortho, and by extension a majority of his allies. Once again he was alone. He sought revenge against Ortho, and he knew where to hurt the man.

He knew his weakness, he knew his strengths. He knew his resolved, and what made him tick. He also knew what he loved, as well as -who-. He didn't care anymore, as he held Samehade, he moved to seal up the blade. He didn't feel like carrying it, he slowly stalked closer to Lera, and by extension Ortho.  His blood was boiling.

Obviously resisting every urge to just...Attack, he'd feel relieved...To show him, he wasn't a Hero. He wasn't a victim, he was considering Ortho, A child. He thought the world was out to get him, so he despertly tried to break free of the cage he was trapped in. He bit the bottom of his lip, hoping pain would sate his urge to attack if only momentarily. He knew....With one hit, he could end this new source of hate before it developed further...One strike....One strike...But he couldn't. He knew if he attacked it would be a problem. One he didn't wish to handle currently.* - Fri Nov  6 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) stared at the man known as Ortho as he spoke "Fine, Let's settle this. Ortho, Once and for fucking all. I hope, death will open your eyes." The male looked at Lera's body, and slowly he tossed a headband towards her with noticable black markings upon it. And his gaze fell upon Ortho as he simply stated:

"I thought we were brothers, But you're just another obstacle. I didn't want to hurt you for Nina's sake, But maybe...She'll be better off without a sorry excuse for a brother." 

He muttered, walking south until he faced Ortho completely. He stared at the male, his eyes narrowed. He thought of Ortho as a false heir to Hideki's will...And it was about time, they figured out who was the rightful heir. Who saw the world for what it really was...Whose morales were correct.* - Fri Nov  6 23:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Kilm(Vysasi) says: Guess I'm meeting someone after this fight. - Fri Nov  6 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath and the moment Ortho moved so did he, his hands were raised together in a quick succession of handseals. Before he stopped slamming his hands against the ground, as a wall of earth was erected, aiming to act as a defense against the incomming air bullets. He took a deep breath and focused, this was his opportunity...To end Ortho.

He had betrayed him once to his knowledge, who knew how many more times he had betrayed him without him knowing? He wasn't sure and the thought...Terrified him , it caused his heart to throb...He could he have trusted this man to begin with? He wasn't sure, there wasn't a need for words...Only strategy, that's what he needed in this moment...To think, he knew his opponent and he had to put his knowledge to the test.

Or he would die.* - Sat Nov  7 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ajisai(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Erg, Ortho, why aren't you listening... - Sat Nov  7 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) reacted the moment he saw the  Earthern wall begin to raise he kicked off his hind leg, sending himself towards the walls as they began to close. He landed against the wall, staying against it with the use of Suimen, his heart was racing. As he aimed to make himself to the top as it finally closed, looking down upon the spikes which were beginning to shoot up. With his hands raised to chest level, a series of handseals would be made. Before slamming his hands down against the roof of the dome.

Immediately lightning would shoot from his finger tips, aiming to take out the spikes which were comming towards him. And if possible, strike the dome itself, to weaken if not make a hole in it that could be exploited, he focused, taking a deep breath he understood that his life was on the line. But he felt something stirring deep within himself. It seemed to be prying at his conciousness as he attempted this.* - Sat Nov  7 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was making his way out the hole behind his lightning,  when he saw Ortho take a tumble thanks to Nina's wind, he on the other hand would be virtually unaffected due to being protected by the dome around him. He noticed Ortho making a series of handseals, and immediately the chakra was gathered around his body. He'd suddenly pick up in speed, as he lept, once the wind came, with the fireball shortly behind it.

As he lept, instead of comming down he found himself going up, lifted into the air as his mass was reduced to practically nothing. Had he managed to evade Ortho's strike, he'd make his way to the top of the Earthern Corridor, in which he'd find his perch.. He had no desire to use that technique forever, channeling chakra to the soles of his feet to keep him attatched to the wall.* - Sat Nov  7 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) his eyes glared down at Ajisai, Nina, and Ortho. But more specifically Ortho, he didn't know who Ajisai was, the skin tone belonged to the only person he knew. His fist was clenched,  as he looked at Ortho he stopped. He had no reason to stop, he stopped because he wouldn't attack someone who was defending someone, if only Ajisai didn't step into the way. His heart was racing as his gaze focused in on Ortho.

He wanted to see blood...He wanted to spill blood, but he didn't attack. He wouldn't endanger innocent 'civilians'.* - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) kicked off his perch, purposfully increasing the chakra flow to his legs since he was utilizing the suimen technique, to send him propelled off the top of the dome like novice attempting Suimen would be shot off, although it was more controlled. This was  his attempt to dodge the fireball, had he succeeded, his hands were raised to chest level making a single handseal. Before inhaling and exhaling several times.

Several small balls of wind were shot at his person, with pinpoint accuracy, aimed for his stomach, shoulders,  and legs.  He wasn't holding back in the slightest, he needed to make a point.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as is bullets shot across the sky. Hoping to find their intended target of Ortho, only for him to be protected...By two people. The Earth Wall, followed by Ume's body. His eyes focused in on Ume, when the first one hit, he saw her blood splatter. He went wide-eyed in disbelief, his heart felt like it had stopped. He was forced to watch as the rest of the bullets drilled into the fragile woman. Who was backed up against the wall. He couldn't help but meet her gaze...Those yellow eyes, that dissapointed gaze.

It hurt.

He heard her words as clear as day, as he her eyes flutter shut and blood trailed from her lips, down her alabaster flesh. The life of a flower...Had been extinguished. He had killed her, it was his fault..."No, It's Ortho's fault." He heard a voice in the back of his mind speak, he didn't care to think back into it, but he felt a certain influx of emotions entering his body. As he muttered "If only...If only...You didn't exist...Didn't Exist.." He spoke under his breath.

The boy entered a state of hyperventalating. His chest, rised and lowered growing faster as the moments passed. "If only....You weren't here...If you were gone...Erased...Dead...Like Hideki...She'd....She'd be fine..." He muttered, his eyes looking towards the ground in front of him, as something broke inside of him...It snapped,  black Chakra began to seep from his person, small bubbles which seemed to begin to increase in numbers around his person. His eyes found the ground in front of him.

"You....This....This is your fault...Ortho....I'll kill you....For her sake."* - Sat Nov  7 02:08:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked down towards Ortho, Index's own eyes had changed his pupils were slitted, in an almost preditorial manner. His breathing was heavy, and occasionally an animalistic purr as if he was looking at his prey could be heard. As he stared down at Ortho he simply stated "It is....Your fault. Her Death, Is on your hands." The propagation of black chakra seemed to have ceased for a moment, and when he blinked his eyes seemed to revert back to normal circular pupils.

He was hurt, so bad, he lost his will to fight. Even if he thought this was Ortho's fault, he was...The gun that pulled the trigger. He was equally as responsible even if he chose to deny it. They shared this death...This responsibility was theirs...A sin they'd have to bear together for eternity. But his eyes were opened to this darkness. 

"Ortho....Is the source of all my problems....He isn't my friend...My Brother or my ally...He's an obstacle."

He finally found a target to manifest his hatred towards, his desire for revenge, the man behind the mask had been unveiled, any trust, or compassion he had for Ortho,was gone. "I'll kill you Ortho." He stated, as he jumped from his perch, giving Ume's body one final glance. He cut his attachments to Ortho and his family, His allies. This wasn't the Index they knew, not any longer...No he wasn't even Index any longer. The Identity he had created to start over...It no longer existed. Who was he? What did he fight for....He'd figure all of that out, once Ortho was dead. 

Turning his back to them, he slowly began walking away without looking back. As a generous offer, he'd give Ortho time to mourn her death, as he intended to do.* - Sat Nov  7 02:40:51 2015
