<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath he had decided, he needed to think over the past few weeks, and meditation would be ideal for clearing his mind. Slowly he sat down on top of Sunagakure's gates, his legs crossed Indian style, his arms rested against his legs as he closed his eyes. This was a unique process for him, he didn't know what to do, there was to much going on for his mind to efficiently consider a plan. But as he concentrated the faces of his friends passed through his mind.

He thought about not being able to save Hideki, the trials of his relationship, and the oncomming battle. His mind felt clouded, and he searched for guidance. Inhaling gently, before exhaling in the same manner, through everything he's been through he's always thought destruction would bring him happiness, that he could rebuild this world. But as he sat there, he began to believe in the opposite.

He was starting to feel as if peace was the answer to what he needed, he believed if he wanted to be happy, he had to make peace with himself and with the world around him. Instead of seeking death, he should welcome life. There were many people, he didn't want to lose, and he knew if he continued upon this same path, if they weren't dead, they'd leave him, he didn't want to be alone. Just thinking about it, caused him to shiver.

He was afraid, but it was the strength of others which gave him the strength to move on. And he couldn't risk losing all he cared for, the ones he loved. He desired to bring about an era of peace, where he...Nor the ones he loved were hunted,  for looking for a way out. After a moment, he opened his eyes and looked out over Sunagakure, his mind oddly felt a bit clearer, as he stared over the village.

"This Village...I'd like to see the world, be able to smile like these villagers do. Some day."* - Tue Nov  3 02:46:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked towards the figure who currently wore the hat, he looked her up and down with a swift glance. Taking in her noticable features, before his gaze shifted to Ortho "Plant?" He thought to himself, deciding Ortho had decided to venture into horiculture---He wouldn't judge another man's interests, he listened as the man inquired as to his reason for being here.

"I couldn't do that to Nina, Though---It depends on the bounty." He spoke in a Joking manner.* - Tue Nov  3 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked towards the figure she was the one he hadn't had the pleasure of meeting recently as he looked to Ortho "As tempting as that may be, I think I'll pass. But had you hit One Hundred and -one- Million. Your life would've been forfeited my friend." He stated with a gentle smile, as he approached the cloaked figure as he spoke "Ortho, you haven't introduced me to your friend yet." And without further ado, he offered his hand to the figure. "My name's Index."* - Tue Nov  3 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Friend. - Tue Nov  3 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) observed her behavior, for the moment he didn't respond to Ortho and his eyes found her fingers as she ran them against the back of his hand his eyes found her own. And he examined the color, his vision focused on her iris, studying her eyes. They say the eyes are the windows to the soul, and as she spoke. Without missing a beat he replied "Extremely." Desiring to see her reaction to this statement.* - Tue Nov  3 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched her, his eyes trailing down her person as he spoke "Those who are extremely dangerous, are mostly those who've gained the power neccessary to protect those around them. Your name is a weapon, It fires a shot into a person's brain. And believe it or not, it helps them formulate an opinion of you, I won't ask you to tell me, your name. If you want to, I'd be happy, If you don't that's fine as well." He paused for a bit scratching his chin.

"Seems like I'm rambling, But let me say this, "Extremely Dangerous" is based on your perspective, Depending on which side of the spectrum you gaze at me from. So I prefer you'd formulate your own beliefs." He stated, lowering his hand.* - Tue Nov  3 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Why is he talking to me instead of the person who is important? - Tue Nov  3 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at the woman as he simply stated "Protection? You could say that. But I'm sure Ortho would do a better job. But, I'm reccomending, you make some friends. That you wouldn't mind watching your back, These are troubling times. And there are only a select few wishing to make a differece, But that's like tossing a stone into a bucket of water. You never know what kind of waves you'll make."* - Tue Nov  3 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) stared at her as he simply spoke "Because, There's potential in everyone, I have placed faith in you for now." He smiled briefly, as he spoke "Ortho spend time with Nina, there may not be a lot of time left." He warned before finishing with "That's why I came here, I'd rather deliver that in person." His expression was grim for a moment, before turning into a smile. "But don't think to much into it." He stated turning.* - Tue Nov  3 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Strange, it looked like he was delivering bad news but then he smiled. - Tue Nov  3 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Ume. - Tue Nov  3 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) stopped as she said her name, and a single hand was raised as he waved back to her. "It's a pleasure." He stated thinking about her name, It was interesting. But he had managed to accomplish his goal. The rest was for Ortho to prepare for. He continued walking until dissappearing with the aid of a handseal.* - Tue Nov  3 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hey...Kat. - Tue Nov  3 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt like he shouldn't ask what happened, he had a fairly good idea, what did happen. But he slowly stepped forward, attempting to approach her, he'd aim to wrap his arms around her, a single hand going behind her head if permitted to bring her in closer to his chest as he spoke:

"We can...Relax now right?"* - Tue Nov  3 23:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as he held her he closed his eyes subtly "She won't be a problem for us anymore.." He stated, a bit glad, that they could live in the now, and not plot for the future,  they weren't hunting anyone and for the moment, they weren't being hunted. "But I'm glad."* - Tue Nov  3 23:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She was so nervous. So -excited-. She had so much adrenaline. - Tue Nov  3 23:49:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked down into her eyes as he simply smiled, he watched her eyes dance. He was awe-stricken by the sight. "A challenge?" He repeated under his breath as he spoke "I was thinking for a while about us Kat." He paused, he had a warm smile but his gaze showed something serious, as if this was something he'd thought long and hard about.* - Wed Nov  4 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) attempted to take her hands within his own, as he saw her gaze shift from him,  he'd smile a bit warmly.Seeking her eyes again with his own, though seeing her gaze so vibrant and full of life would be etched into his memories for years to come. After a moment his gaze would find the ground, the space between them as he spoke:

"These last few months...Have been...Not what I've expected, But they've been exciting...And I feel like, I've grown as a person, I've matured, and changed...Hopefully for the better."

He sighed, lightly, but it was a sigh of tension being released, as he looked back up to her. "I was able....To come to understand my feelings for those around me." He paused once again. "And Ultimately you." He stated stopping to see what she'd do or not do.* - Wed Nov  4 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's....have fun, instead. - Wed Nov  4 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as she spoke, and he resisted a sigh. But he looked into her eyes, as he spoke "Okay." To her suggestion at waiting, part of him wondered if they were on the same page. But he managed to hold onto his happy demeanor as he spoke "What did you have in mind?" He asked, his words having a certain 'flow' to them as they seemed to just roll off his tongue.* - Wed Nov  4 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not...sure. - Wed Nov  4 00:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To explore. Especially murder. I like exploring that. - Wed Nov  4 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) stared back into her eyes as she spokeand he chuckled, it was subtle but he wasn't expecting anything different from Katsune not now and really not anytime soon as he took a look at her, assessing her appearance from head to toe, before once again focusing on her eyes as he asked in a somewhat playful manner.

"And how do you plan to go about that?"* - Wed Nov  4 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No...she wants to figure herself out by killing me. - Wed Nov  4 00:34:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Why? - Wed Nov  4 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's because she knows she's weaker than me. Emotionally. - Wed Nov  4 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She wants to prove that wrong. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She can only do that by killing me. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: She won't be able to. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She won't be in control of her emotions. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm not sure, she'll be a shinobi for much longer. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She'll be crippled by how over-whelming it is. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: She took the private exam. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That so? - Wed Nov  4 00:39:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But, at the cost of one of her arms. - Wed Nov  4 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's not why she can't kill me. - Wed Nov  4 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She can't kill me because she won't be able to focus. - Wed Nov  4 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know, because I wasn't able to focus when fighting Kilm. - Wed Nov  4 00:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm? - Wed Nov  4 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her as she spoke, and he was definately surprised, he didn't say anything but just looked at her. Wondering where she aimed to lead this conversation, though he was curious what would end up happening should she kill again..But he was forming... Theories about Katsune's desire to kill.* - Wed Nov  4 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's..... - Wed Nov  4 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Go lie down somewhere. I wanna talk about Kilm. - Wed Nov  4 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or sit down. Either way, don't wanna be standing up. - Wed Nov  4 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --...Alright. - Wed Nov  4 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: We can lie down. - Wed Nov  4 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) walked behind her she'd find that there were practically countless rooms.* - Wed Nov  4 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ToYoToMi - Wed Nov  4 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he sat beside her, though he was still wondering about the context she used the word 'excites', he looked over to her as he looked at her giving her, the time she needed to vent while he tried to think of something not extremely lame to say.* - Wed Nov  4 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) whistled casually, as she spoke that, his eyes shifted to the side, revealing what he thought.* - Wed Nov  4 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I....can't calm down. -Ever-. - Wed Nov  4 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not until...I talk this out.... - Wed Nov  4 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And figure out what I've done. - Wed Nov  4 01:05:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll listen to you, and try to help. - Wed Nov  4 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think.... - Wed Nov  4 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I need someone to agree with me. Either that what I did was bad, or good. Because I'm not sure. - Wed Nov  4 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm.... - Wed Nov  4 01:13:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It -will- come up in my decisions in the future. - Wed Nov  4 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In my conversations. - Wed Nov  4 01:13:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We don't figure this out right now? - Wed Nov  4 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then when someone brings his name up.....I'll panic. I'll be weak. - Wed Nov  4 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "Then we'll just have to figure it out right now." He stated, looking to her, he nodded his head, he didn't want Katsune to panic or be weak in any situation. So he didn't mind helpin her work through this.* - Wed Nov  4 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Wed Nov  4 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: U-um.... - Wed Nov  4 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lie down. - Wed Nov  4 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: On your back. - Wed Nov  4 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he swallowed hard. But slowly he moved to transition to the bed, in which case he'd lay down as instructed, upon his back. He looked to her, wondering where she was going with this. Though partially he was concerned this would end up with her fist against his chest once again.* - Wed Nov  4 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as she removed her boots, before seeing her crawl atop of him on all fours, which did result in a faint reddening of his cheeks. Especially when she sat upon his lap. His eyes found her hands as they rested on his chest, but his gaze returned to Kat's own eyes as he asked:

"Why?"* - Wed Nov  4 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her as spoke, and he focused on each word she said. Before he took a deep breath and exhaled. He didn't say anything but just from her words, he was starting to paint a more clear picture of what had happened, but he didn't say anything and watched her face, or more specifically her eyes.* - Wed Nov  4 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched her arms as they moved, feeling her palms find their rest on his arms, his gaze returned to Kat as he gazed up at her from where she was, He was realising the gravity of her situation, and was taking it in, "An obsession...?" He thought to himself, it definately did seem possible. But he spoke:

"I don't think, you could've changed it Kat...Love makes guys do stupid things, and some times it changes people for the worst." He paused for a bit choosing his next words carefully.

"I believe, what you did was right. If it continued...I don't believe, you'd be able to call him Kilm...Or think of him as your 'brother'..I think for the sake of his memory you did what was right."* - Wed Nov  4 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head as he realised he spoke prematurely,  so he waited patiently, he figured at the end of what she had just said. He had hoped it was his proper time to finish what he was saying, his belief had only changed slightly but he decided to wait a moment, he took in what she said entirely, before replaying it in his mind. This time he decided to wait a little bit more before speaking.* - Wed Nov  4 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I... - Wed Nov  4 01:50:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay.... - Wed Nov  4 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I get it now. - Wed Nov  4 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's... - Wed Nov  4 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why I like...murder. - Wed Nov  4 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her arms wrapping around him, and he looked towards Kat as she hugged him. He listened to her but instinctually his hand moved to rest on her back as she hugged him.

"Playing people? The thrill? Of being the Smartest person in the room? The strongest?" He inquired.* - Wed Nov  4 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I murder people.... - Wed Nov  4 01:57:45 2015
