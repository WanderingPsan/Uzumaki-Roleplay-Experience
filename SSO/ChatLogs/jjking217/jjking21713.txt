<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was hit by the mud, and was definately thrown backwards, before being swept away. The pain and numbness swept through his body, with the numbness gradually receeding, but regardless he had no way to escape the river of mud, and eventually when the  mud stopped carrying him. He was laying in the mud, breathing heavily, mostly out of fatigue, she had just given him the work. He also was in pain but it was definately bearable.

He had no clones hidden, so that area was clear.* - Sun Oct 25 02:21:39 2015

They've been living together for almost two months now. If not longer.* - Sun Oct 25 02:35:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was once again taken back by the kiss, and suffered from a deeper blush this time around. As he took the dice, and offered her the money after their lips had parted.* - Sun Oct 25 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded as he looked towards the bottle of Sake, and slowly undid the cork. Before raising the bottle to his lips, he'd take a large gulp, followed by another which he assumed to be enough for the sake of the bet.  Afterwards he picked up the dice, and rolled them.* - Sun Oct 25 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Cheek. - Sun Oct 25 03:50:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) extends his hand to her cheek and with a gentle motion he carresses it before watching to see what she rolled. After a moment of hesitation he extends his arm for her.* - Sun Oct 25 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) figured this was the dice god's way of balancing things out. And when Katsune's gaze locked with his own, he knew that the dice god had abanadoned him, closing his eyes, he felt the blade of the Kunai dig into his arm, dragging across, he was sure it'd probably scar. And man did he groan and moan in pain as she did that. The tension in his body could easily be seen along with the pain on his face.

"F-Fuck!" He shouted, as the pain surged through his body, taking a part of his shirt, he slowly aimed to wrap it around the wound, before taking the dice he tried to roll but winced at the pain, --Though he still ended up rolling As he thought "I guess, I deserved that."* - Sun Oct 25 03:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Slap. - Sun Oct 25 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her arm, as he held his hand flat, aligning it with her fore-arm, before it shot down aiming to slap her forearm, and cause a moderate amount of pain with a bit of stinging thrown in.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sighed as he spoke "I'm going to have to buy you...So many new suits..." He muttered just loud enough for her to hear, as he grasped his trusty pencil, channeling lightning chakra, he moved vertically right down the center, with a light cut only capable of leaving a welt as he offered her the dice.* - Sun Oct 25 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as he noticed her Yukata being cut open. "Crap...I actually liked that Yukata..." He spoke in a low tone, a bit saddened, though also embarrassed as he saw it begin unraveling which was quickly stopped by Katsune as she took the dice he awaited her rolls.* - Sun Oct 25 04:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) once again, takes a few large gulps of the bottle, and the first one was almost finished, a faint red tint to his cheeks was obvious as he rolled again.* - Sun Oct 25 04:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Lick.. - Sun Oct 25 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at Katsune's bare leg,  and blushed deeply. Honestly he wondered if he should do it...But part of him more specifically the drunk part asked him "Why shouldn't I?" So his hands slowly moved down, aiming to gently lift her leg, as he exteneded his tongue attempting to run it up the side of her calf before lowering her leg. His blush was much more pronounced at the end of the task than it had been at the beginning as he offered her the dice.* - Sun Oct 25 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe we should play a different game. . . - Sun Oct 25 04:26:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) shrugged as he spoke "Yes and no, I'm never truly bored when I'm with you." He stated, attempting to wrap his arm around her shoulders.* - Sun Oct 25 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked towards her with a gentle smile as she scooted closer he looked towards her as he spoke "I see,  If you're tired then you should probably rest." He stated lightly, surprised that she actually scooted closer instead of away.* - Sun Oct 25 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hey, Asteroth-sama. - Sun Oct 25 13:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You know - Sun Oct 25 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I've been thinking about. - Sun Oct 25 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: What you said. - Sun Oct 25 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And There's a lot I'd like to do, But I'm not sure If It's my place. - Sun Oct 25 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . So long as it isn't perverted.. - Sun Oct 25 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Well...Ideally, what would've been the most enjoyable would've been helping you relax by the lake-side,  Maybe a picnic, or something of the sorts. - Sun Oct 25 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I like the water, It's almost calming.. - Sun Oct 25 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . That is fine, I suppose. - Sun Oct 25 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Were you hoping for something else? - Sun Oct 25 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Nothing in particularly. I just expected something outlandish. - Sun Oct 25 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: The only outlandish thing, I have the guts to ask you is maybe, to have a few drinks with me and talk about anything for the day. - Sun Oct 25 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But I didn't think you'd enjoy the latter. - Sun Oct 25 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Either or would have fit. - Sun Oct 25 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then out of those two, which would you prefer, My Queen? - Sun Oct 25 14:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I believe that's for you to decide. - Sun Oct 25 14:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then, shall we go for drinks? - Sun Oct 25 14:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: We shall. - Sun Oct 25 14:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) moves to elegantly lift Asteroth in his arms princess carry style. As he spoke "Then off we go." He stated as he began to walk towards the house, he figured she'd be more comfortable in her own home, than drinking out in public, and he didn't really mind, if she had a living room, he'd move to carry her over to the couch, of course removing his shoes before entering as to not track mud before setting her down. He wasn't sure if she had wine and sake in the house.

So he ran to the store, and bought, several high grade bottles of wines, and sakes. He figured she wouldn't enjoy beers, he didn't anyway. So once he returned he spoke "M'Lady, May I sit beside you?"* - Sun Oct 25 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded  his head, as he looked around he found her living room quite beautiful,  then again he probably lived in some part of this house when he was here didn't he?  But slowly he fetched two glasses, and set then down on the nearest table as he took a seat beside Asteroth, he did seem to be on the more nervous side but he asked "Would you prefer...Wine or Sake?" He asked, preparing to pour her a glass.* - Sun Oct 25 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) attempted to avoid the question, as he pulled out a glass and slowly he poured Sake into both, offering one to Asteroth as he himself took one, raising it to his lips he took a sip.  As he spoke "No such law exists unless you yourself made one~" He joked lightly, he seemed to be...'relaxing', Though he was still very nervous.* - Sun Oct 25 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took yet another sip of the glass, after watching her as he spoke "At risk of ruining your opinion of me, I do." He stated lightly,  lowering the glass as he rested it on his knee, while still holding it, Index was definately no light weight, he had built up a tolerance.  As he looked to Asteroth, he decided to ask it was definately quite randomn but: 

"Asteroth-sama, Do you have any hobbies? Or rather things you enjoy doing?"* - Sun Oct 25 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was forced to laugh a bit at the  'random girl stuff', as he looked to Asteroth he spoke "Maybe sometime soon, I can buy you a full day at a hotsprings." He offered, with a light smile, he seemed to down the rest of his glass. Before waiting a bit before he refilled it.  a single hand moved through his hair before it simply sprung back into place as he decided to ask:

"What kind of obscure knowledge?" He was curious but he didn't remember seeing or hearing an answer to that in recent days.* - Sun Oct 25 14:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was kind of enjoying Asteroth's pleasant attitude. As he spoke "I've become interested in the Greek 'Mythology' that's arisen recently, I also heard of something called Christianity---But you said lost Ruins? Have you actually seen any? Or explored any?" He asked looking at her as he took another sip of the sake,  he partially doubt she did, he couldn't see her investigating an old, dusty and dirty ruins.* - Sun Oct 25 15:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) once it is empty he makes a move to fill it again in case she wanted more to drink, he seemed somewhat more relaxed a lot more. As he rested his back against the couch as he spoke "I see...And I'm glad you came here, I feel like this part of the world is better because you did." He stated with a warm smile, as he took a sip of his own glass, "But the Land of Vegetables, What was it like?" He asked,  "And if you want to you can put your legs up." He stated offering his lap for her legs so she can rest them.* - Sun Oct 25 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) did blush a tad, as he noticed her actually going with the idea, though he was a bit embarrassed that he had even suggested it, but he didn't seem to 'mind'. If that makes sense, but he nodded his head as he listened to her speaking, and honestly it sounded to good to be true, and it probably was. But he heard her speak of mercenaries as he spoke:

"It sounds, like a great place, I'd like to visit it one of these days." He commented lightly before he spoke "Kind of a weird question, But do you have a favorite animal or anything of the sort?" He asked lightly, it was definately a random question but he was aiming to get to know Asteroth.* - Sun Oct 25 15:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as Asteroth's finger plucked his nose, and he recoiled a bit, rubbing his nose as he bowed his head apologetically, rubbing his nose with one hand "S-Sorry A-Asteroth-sama.." He stated lightly, now embarrassed that he had been called out, but as the conversation progressed he looked to her "R-Really? An octopus or s-squid...I never w-would've guessed it..." He admitted lightly, taking a sip from his glass of sake after he figured his nose had been rubbed enough.* - Sun Oct 25 15:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head in response to her words "R-Right.." He stated lightly, as he said nothing while she sipped, before he heard her speak once again as he spoke: "T-There's no reason in particular, I was just curious. It's always n-nice to learn about t-those around me..." He stated lightly before he asked "Have you ever played any sports or games with family?" He asked he wondered if her phobia of germs came from her family or maybe if it was something she developed around strangers.* - Sun Oct 25 15:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) shook his head as he spoke "I was just curious,  I was wondering if maybe your desire not to get messy came when you got older.  But it's kind of nice to know that it's something that's always been there." He stated, realising how awkward his sentence sounded as he spoke "There's a lot of dice games, I'd reccomend trying with someone you trust. They're fun and at the same time, help you get to know someone."

He spoke, laughing lightly as he decided to state: "This game is one called chicken...Though...It can get a bit...Awkward. The entire game is based off a series of actions to get a person to take a penalty, which will force them to pay a fine. And roll a dice which will decide on their penalty, which will consist of...Take a drink, Truth...Which is when they have to answer a question asked by the other person truthfully, or Dare when they have to accomplish a task given by the other person." * - Sun Oct 25 16:50:20 2015

He admitted before he spoke "Then how about this, Name Six body parts, And I'll name Six Actions...We'll roll twice, the first role determines the body part, and the second determines the action which will be dealt... You can call for a penalty if you like...But how about....One Hundred Thousand will be the Cost of a penalty. Then you will roll again 1-2 Is take a drink, 3-4 Will be truth and 5-6 Will be Dare.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: The order in which they're listed would be the corresponding action I have to complete, in which case the person who rolled needs to complete the task. If either party objects, they must accept the penalty. - Sun Oct 25 17:37:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Are you able to make a clone of any kind? - Sun Oct 25 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Nope. - Sun Oct 25 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Sun Oct 25 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: All it requires you to do is send your chakra to the water and mold it into a clone. - Sun Oct 25 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Simple stuff. - Sun Oct 25 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Requires the Tiger handseal. - Sun Oct 25 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath inhaling followed by a deep exhale, as hands were raised to chest level, he nodded at the seal she demonstrated but first he bowed his head "Thanks for teaching me." He stated lightly, she didn't have to so he appreciated it. But slowly he smiled this technique seemed fairly easy, and he appreicated that, he wasn't a fan of hard to learn techniques, so as he observed her he decided it was time to try.

Raising his hands to chest level he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as the water began to rise as his chakra was sent into it, slowly a clone emerged from the water's confines, an exact replica of the male before the Mizukage, he looked at his clone as he nodded his head, he had a firm grasp of the technique, he seemed to be awefully skilled with elemental Ninjutsu.* - Sun Oct 25 18:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: They cannot learn a jutsu of that element. - Sun Oct 25 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: keep your clone there. - Sun Oct 25 18:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head as he watched her next technique, he scratched his chin noticing the surplus of handseals which would definately make this technique annoying in the case of a battle. But he slowly nodded, with his hands raised to chest level he slowly began to replicate the technique she was showing. Taking his time, he waved the eight seals. Surprisingly he had a bit of speed when it came to the seals, suggesting a great mastery.

After he attempted this looking towards the Mizukage's clone, his chakra was flooded out, before the water arose around the Mizukage's clone, creating a sphere in which he placed his hand on the water which contained the clone, his chakra stabalizing it. As he blinked "I see." He stated  nodding his head as he spoke "Definately...Nice to have in battle." He admitted.* - Sun Oct 25 18:28:28 2015
