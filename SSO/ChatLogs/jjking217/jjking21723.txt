As long as you love, what you are, and enjoy what you're doing. I'll be in support,  I never enjoyed labels such as good and evil, What makes a good person good? Or a bad person bad?" He asked her, but it wasn't directed -at- her. Before he spoke:

"The person, I see in front of me is Katsune, It doesn't matter to me. If you're a good person, if you're a predator, Or if you're just doing what you want. As long as you're living life Kat, I'm sure everything will work out." * - Wed Nov  4 02:11:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched her lips, as she formed each individual word. And slowly he closed his eyes as he decided not to speak this time. It wasn't neccessary, he enjoyed the thought of Katsune being herself, but he was also somewhat eager to see how the latter half of her statement would unfold. Ultimately hoping there wasn't another Kilm...He didn't want her to experience that kind of loss twice.* - Wed Nov  4 02:19:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her, and honestly he was a bit startled by shaking of her hand.  And the words that came out of her mouth...Stabbed him far deeper than any blade could, his eyes flared upon and suddenly he moved to a sitting position.

"W-What...? When...? Why...How....How...could that...Bastard?!" 

He felt his blood boiling, but  honestly his reaction was a bit delayed, he didn't believe the words his ears picked up. It startled him, he felt almost light headed like this revelation...Turned his world upside down.

"Ka-Kat..."

He realised very quickly...He couldn't kill someone that was already dead...He had no way...of avenging Katsune....No way of helping her get revenge...Getting even...He was powerless.* - Wed Nov  4 03:12:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at Katsune, he sighed, a lot had just been thrown at him as he simply listened to her. And watched her expressions, he'd move to maneuver behind her resting his legs at either of her sides, as he aimed to hug her as he spoke:

"Kat, are you sure....? You'll be fine...? I'm here for you...If you need to talk more."* - Wed Nov  4 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Orokuru....he got raped too. - Wed Nov  4 03:34:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looks at her, he probably shouldn't have bought it up...But at the very least he was trying to switch to 'lighter' topics...Though this wasn't exactly the best sakeway. 

"I won't ask for a reason then..But I want to say...If there's one thing you don't have to worry about...Is that...I won't die on you.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would've given her a kiss on the cheek had she still been turned to look at him. Had she not, the kiss would've found the side of her neck. "I'll be here to talk to, Vent to, Or beat up to the end---Depending on your attitude for the day." He joked, attempting to rest his chin on her shoulder from behind.* - Wed Nov  4 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) held her gently for a moment more, before letting her go. "What would you like to do? We still haven't actually celebtrated like we said we would."* - Wed Nov  4 04:04:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) stood up, before running into the kitchen, he grabbed a few bottles of sake, before returning to Katsune. Setting one down in between them and the other two on the cabinet to their side. He figured they could drink them together. So he cracked open the first bottle, offering her the first sip.* - Wed Nov  4 04:12:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) in that case, had he been allowed taking Ume by the hand, he'd lead her and Ortho off. Seemingly pretty 'giddy'.* - Thu Nov  5 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) ended up leading them to a small house not far from where they originally were, it was abandoned, but there was a small stairway leading down into a basement which was surprisingly 'expansive', there was no locks on this house as he spoke "When I was younger, me and a few friends used to use this place as a hideout of sorts, We'd go and take clothes, food and Comics from people who didn't 'need'  them, We used to use the clothes to dress up like those old Samurai and stuff...It was pretty fun." Had they looked around, there were practically rows of clothes, dresses, suits, and other attire...Seems he'd kept up to date.

"Eh, there are underclothes as well, I'm not sure what sizes you wear though. So feel free to try it all on."

Once he came into contact with money, he made sure to keep this place 'funded', in case anything went wrong.* - Thu Nov  5 00:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked, he was definately surprised by her shape, he wasn't expecting her to be curvacious or flaw less skin. He swallowed hard before he spoke "Y-Yeah...Well then.." He stated, the 'woman's clothes, he hoped they'd fit her. For whatever reason, it was stocked up. Maybe when he was younger he expected himself to have lots of lady friends. But as he walked over to the section, he returned with the first outfit he had in store for her, first he set down a pair of panties, which were a deep red, color with black trimmings.

And a bra, which followed the same color scheme. Finally, he pulled out, a dress which, was black with a red belt. He looked at her and asked. "Would you change into it? So we can see how it looks?"* - Thu Nov  5 00:59:18 2015
