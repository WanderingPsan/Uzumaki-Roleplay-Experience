But then he decided the princess carry was less work on her end, and decided upon it. As he approached Asteroth, he'd slowly bend down, attempting to pick her up in his arms lightly, before he nodded. Before he began walking towards where Xon was last seen.* - Mon Oct 19 01:09:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Omega**(Jjking217) as they entered Amegakure he'd smile lightly, before he asked "Shall I take you home, M'Lady? I'm sure you'd like to wash up after having been in such a village for a few days." He stated, slowly removing his mask.* - Mon Oct 19 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would slowly proceed to carry Asteroth to her house a taking care to remove his shoes at the door as to not track dirt into the probably sparkling home. And slowly he moved to set her down in a chair. Before he went to the bathroom, and began setting the water, nice and warm and not overly hot as he spoke "M'Lady, I've been wondering if there was anywhere I could stay?" He hadn't actually thought about his living arrangements and living outside wasn't the best.* - Mon Oct 19 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked towards her as he simply stated "Five days." It was the truth and as he  looked around, he slowly scratched his chin. Bowing to Asteroth as he spoke "Thank you...For letting me stay here."  Before he stood upright and looked around once again before he asked. "Should I prepare a bed for a massage if you still desire one after you get out of the bath?" He asked lightly, he probably was in need of a bath himself, though he wasn't overly dirty.* - Mon Oct 19 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) decided to take this time and prepare her bed as instructed, after a few moments, he realised she was probably going to be a while but as a good servant he patiently waited for a while preparing a glass of hot tea for her once she exited the bath but since it seemed like she prepared to sleep he exited the house, assigning two guards to watch the door as he headed off. Leaving a note that stated:

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Index you're letting other villages' people strengthen you. - Mon Oct 19 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They give you power so you can fight alongside them. - Mon Oct 19 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And you don't even intend to be loyal? - Mon Oct 19 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looks towards the ceiling as he simply spoke "You misunderstand." He seemed to pause for a moment.

"I will never be loyal to a Village, I can't be, It isn't in my nature. I believe that the fact so many can say they are, is arrogance. How can you be loyal to a Village, I can't comprehend it." 

He stared back into her eyes as he spoke:

"I'm loyal to the individual. There are people, I would never betray, and would fight alongside, fight for, Defend, Even at the cost of my own name and life. But for a Village? It's impossible to be loyal to it in my eyes."

His gaze was averted.

"My logic may be flawed, but It is the logic I stand by. I will never betray you, if that's what you're thinking. Even if you place a Kunai to my neck right now, I will not make any move against you."* - Mon Oct 19 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Friends huh. Loyal to friends. - Mon Oct 19 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And what if two friends fight each other? Go to war against each other? - Mon Oct 19 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked towards Katsune, as he spoke "If two friends fight eachother, It'd pain me greatly. But that's one thing, I can't accept. To mend that tear, I'll take the pain, suffering....Hate of both. Even if it kills me, But, I will never attack either of them. If I lose them both in the process, I suppose we were never truly friends to begin with, If a bond is so easily shattered, Could I even call it a bond?" He spoke, the latter half was him thinking to himself but he spoke:

"Don't get me wrong, You may believe from my words, I desire peace. When in actuality, Pain is much more entertaining. I believe peace harms a person, far worse than pain ever can. Pain doesn't dull your blade, It doesn't dull your senses, make you second guess yourself. Pain and Sorrow are absolute, Pain is your friend. It tells you that you're still alive. But Peace, is fleeting, when you desire it the most...It's already gone, It makes you weaker, your judgement is flawed."

Once again, he seemed to get a bit darker for a moment.* - Mon Oct 19 03:21:23 2015

He stated, he wasn't ripped, but he was slightly toned, as was part of his job description he was in shape, not overly so. He extended his hand for the dice.* - Mon Oct 19 04:10:01 2015

As he frantically rubbed it, only to feel the heel of Katsune's foot, hit his nutz, causing him to learn forward in pain, You'd think he'd be used to this by now, but he actually wasn't...Regardless, once he recovered enough, he'd slowly move to grasp one of her feet in his hands.

Swallowing hard, as he began to put his thumbs to work, gently massaging the sole of her foot, he was definately taking his time, if he was going to try, he minds well as give it his all, Right? So he continued to massage with a single hand, blushing deeply as he did so. Occasionally looking down at her foot to make sure he was doing it properly.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Pleasure or Business. - Mon Oct 19 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Are my options. - Mon Oct 19 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno about you, but I haven't been in any good fights for months. I'm eager to ruin someone's day. - Mon Oct 19 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And I'm sure, you're getting tired of hanging with me. - Mon Oct 19 18:12:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But yes. If you win, you'll get a date. - Mon Oct 19 18:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm comfortable making that bet. - Mon Oct 19 18:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Because he can't win. - Mon Oct 19 18:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Sounds good. - Mon Oct 19 18:15:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm,  I see. - Mon Oct 19 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll do that after this match. - Mon Oct 19 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sure. - Mon Oct 19 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Unless something comes up. - Mon Oct 19 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) shrugs "Sure, It's easier to hide a body in the middle of the desert." He joked lightly.* - Mon Oct 19 18:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) leads her off.* - Mon Oct 19 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Funny. I was thinking the same thing. . . - Mon Oct 19 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Guess you're still not durable. That's too bad. - Mon Oct 19 18:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I miss going all out. - Mon Oct 19 18:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) almost shed a tear "Sorry to dissapoint." He stated lightly, a bit annoyed at his own lack of ability to take hits as he spoke "If you want to go all out..That's fine, It's not training if we hold back...Right?"He asked, as he lowered himself into a loose stance, Katsune was definately a lot faster than him and that was a problem, she was also more experienced than he was which was also problematic.* - Mon Oct 19 18:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or else I would. - Mon Oct 19 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Eh... - Mon Oct 19 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm probably not a good match for you in a spar. - Mon Oct 19 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he looked towards Katsune as she dropped to the ground, and immediately he lept backwards as rocks shot from the soil. he definately wasn't the fastest, man in the world, nor the most reflexive, there was a lot of stuff he had to work upon as he watched her his hands were raised to chest level and he held a single handseal, before raising two fingers to the side of his lips.

Inhaling followed by a deep exhale, as flames shot from his mouth gathering into that of a large ball of flames which shot towards the woman, he also held back because it was a spar.* - Mon Oct 19 18:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) certainly was not expecting such an attack, and as such, he immediately channeled his chakra into the ground beneath him, before attempting to suck himself into the ground to avoid the attack which was closing in on him rapidly, had he by some chance in hell managed to avoid such a strike, he'd remain hiding in the ground for a bit longer, she definately had scared him by that display of power, Katsune was no push over.

But on the flip side, if he wasn't able to dodge, without a doubt he'd be hit or grazed resulting in some sort of injury.* - Mon Oct 19 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) certainly hadn't thought to far ahead, he wasn't the best in any range, and was probably one of the worst in most, but regardless, he inhaled followed by a deeep exhale. Before he began moving towards Katsune in the ground as he approached her chakra began gathering in his left hand, and suddenly when he emeged from the ground, a ball of flames was shot at the ground before her, once it connected the ball would explode, aiming to target her legs, with concussive force as well as heat.* - Mon Oct 19 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after all wa said and done he noticed the potential she currently had as mud swirled around his feet, and he raised his hands."I surrunder." He stated lightly.* - Mon Oct 19 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Shit got haywire irl. gotta run for a bit sorry for holding you up like this - Mon Oct 19 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: -omit- - Mon Oct 19 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Fujitora-sensei. - Mon Oct 19 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's been too long. - Mon Oct 19 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Oh hello Index... - Mon Oct 19 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: How've you been? - Mon Oct 19 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Was just going to the monks temple. - Mon Oct 19 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm? - Mon Oct 19 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: May I travel with you? - Mon Oct 19 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Sure. - Mon Oct 19 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) relaxed upon the ground, taking a deep breath, as he inhaled sharply before exhaling he listened to Fujitora's words as he spoke "It'd be my honor, although at my current state, I'm sure she'd be the one protecting me." He stated lightly, running a single hand through his hair,part of him wanted to ask to do something but he felt as if Fujitora would get to that on his own time. Taking out a small book he began reading.* - Mon Oct 19 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Fun thing about this cloth binding...It can be manipulated .. - Mon Oct 19 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Possibilities... - Mon Oct 19 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would flip through the scroll once again before putting it into his bag, as he yawned lightly looking up into the sky he simply spoke "I see, A unique style." He stated, as he relaxed, Fujitora did have some interesting tricks up his sleeves or so he thought, as he spoke "My core abilities are really lacking, Although, I'm sure my Ninjutsu and Control are above Average." He stated lightly referring to his abilitiy.* - Mon Oct 19 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) shook his head "No...Not at all." He paused considering Fujitora's final element, as he inhaled through his nose and exhaled through his mouth.

"Four Elemental affinities, Water, Fire, Earth, And Lightning." He admitted lightly.* - Mon Oct 19 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm, all but wind eh?..Very useful indeed... - Mon Oct 19 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I wish to learn it. - Mon Oct 19 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: But I do suggest obtaining atlease a single weapon unique to your own. - Mon Oct 19 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But Muhhamed probably won't teach me, And I lack any money. - Mon Oct 19 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Within time, you'll learn about fire, earth and water from me...Granted my water element knowledge idn't very vast.. - Mon Oct 19 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I appreciate it.. - Mon Oct 19 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: You know of the water gun correct? - Mon Oct 19 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I don't know any water techniques. - Mon Oct 19 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm..Well this one will be the first.. - Mon Oct 19 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Pay attention. - Mon Oct 19 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) figured this would be an interesting learning experience, and he took a deep breath and smiled a bit repeating Fujitora's description aloud. "Kneading your chakra within yourself slowly to form the liquid chakra, you will be able to mold such into a beam which can be shot out from your mouth, if strong enough this medium sized beam."

He nodded his head before reciting the final piece of information."Water can even become a canon in somes own eye..This jutsu alone can be a great advantage over some earth and fire users, giving you the edge with the little chakra required to use it... " After having finished this recital, he nodded his head.

Inhaling follwed by a brief exhale, as he raised two  fingers to the side of his mouth, inhaling followed by a brief exhale, as he began to gather his water elemental chakra, before inhaling followed by a deep exhale. As a stream of water spewed from his lips shooting forward at the lake, he relaxed, taking a deep breath.

"I think I did it."* - Mon Oct 19 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm... - Mon Oct 19 23:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Sure. - Mon Oct 19 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hey...M'lady. - Mon Oct 19 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm? What is it. . ? - Mon Oct 19 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Nothing, I'm here to serve you aren't I? - Mon Oct 19 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Is there anything you desire? - Mon Oct 19 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head lightly as he spoke "Of course, sounds easy enough." He stated lightly as he looked to Xon he simply stated:

"It isn't our place to question her. Only do as she asks."* - Mon Oct 19 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Ohhh look the drone can talk. - Mon Oct 19 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: They'll be given funds to get new places to live. - Mon Oct 19 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Where they gp is none of my concern. - Mon Oct 19 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you care to call me a Drone again? - Mon Oct 19 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'd advise against it if you value your tongue. - Mon Oct 19 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: If thats the case then why did you state they may be killed. - Mon Oct 19 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zuvian, Xon(Simbasax) says: Awwww so cute. - Mon Oct 19 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: She said the gangs may be killed. - Mon Oct 19 23:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You would do well to earn some. - Mon Oct 19 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he headed towards the residential district and looked around he took a deep breathing in through his nose and out through his mouth as he stared ahead. He cracked his knuckles focusing  as he looked to Xon "I'll head towards the more dangeorus neighborhoods, meet me there when you're done." He stated lightly, as he moved towards his destination, taking a deep breath.

He began knocking on various doors, gaining the attention of the citizens, he spoke of money being given out if they vacated their homes, and etcetera, he was greeeted to few people who didn't take kindly to his words, and as such, he helped himself into their houses, and told them how to be loyal citizens with his fists. Eventually he took a deep breath and decided it was time to go into gang controlled territory. So he waited for Xon.* - Tue Oct 20 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he realised this may be insanely problematic as he entered the neighboorhood he was surrounded by gang members, part of the eighty percent of the world who didn't have the ability to use chakra. He sighed briefly, and cracked his knuckles, before inhaling followed by a brief exhale, he realised that his Taijutsu powers were perhaps on their level, but the fact that he coul dus e ninjutsu put him at an advantage.

And as such as they approached him, he fired off flame shots aiming to damage their person, or knock them back. But none of his attacks were honestly aimed at killing or permanently injuring just suppressing them to make his job easier, but they seemed to be comming in hordes, luckily he had a vast amount of chakra whic made suppressing them a lot easier. 

He took a deep breath after like thirty minutes, he had managed to suppress that one specific section, and in which case he took a deep breath and decided to sigh. Cracking his knuckles, he figured he'd leave the other half to Xon, as he headed off, he seemed to have some business to attend to, and as such he headed off.* - Tue Oct 20 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) slowly approached the water, crouching down, as he spoke "Hello, Hideki-sensei." The male spoke, looking at his own reflection through his coal-black eyes.* - Tue Oct 20 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) shifted his gaze towards Hideki as he spoke "Hm? What's it? Anything." He stated as he stood upright looking at Hideki, he didn't have a reason to avoid eye contact and as such he didn't. He trusted Hideki perhaps with his own life.* - Tue Oct 20 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as the Kunai was tossed towards him, and extending his hand, he grasped it looking at the blade. His coal black eyes examined the blade, staring at the point...The sharpest point, which also was the blade's limitation. And slowly his gaze raised before it rested upon Hideki's eyes, he said nothing for a moment, he simply stared. Listening to the man's words. He looked at the bladed weapon.

And slowly his hands fell to his side, as he spoke "Hideki-sensei....Stop joking around....I don't like these kind of jokes...It's in bad taste." He stated, feeling the muscles in his body tensing, he felt his heart racing, he couldn't believe the words he was hearing in this moment. His left hand tightened into that of a fist, he wanted to hear the words. "It's a joke." He needed to.* - Tue Oct 20 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) he looked down at the blade which he held, he felt the weight of the world crashing down on his body, never before had he experienced the weight of this Blade...It had never hit him like this, it was hard to believe...This man...His Teacher...His Brother...Would ask this of him, he felt his heart tremor, it hurt him...A lot. He felt the tears beginning to swell in his eyes, but he wouldn't release his tears...He couldn't.

He felt the heat of his body, and never before had he noticed the coldness of the world around him, which rocked through his body despite it's heat, ripping away at his defenses, leaving him frozen in place, he watched the man he once deemed as strong cry....The tear...The one a man was never supposed to shed.

He didn't...Know how to reply...He didn't want to...He couldn't...Could he drive this into Hideki's chest...And still be the same person..? Could he call himself Index? Would it make him a shell of his former self? Would he even be human? Were questions that swirled through his mind.

"S-Sensei...Please....P-Please...Don't...Don't a-ask me to do this....E-Even if you've lost...Y-You can still gain more...Y-You have time.."* - Tue Oct 20 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was stunned his brain taking a moment to process what he was seeing as Hideki charged forward "Wh-What...?" He muttered, as Hideki was suddenly in front of him, and his own body served to stop Hideki's movement, he hadn't come to the inevitable truth. And when it his his brain, his heart felt like it stopped. "What...?" He stated, his eyes widened in horror, as his gaze began to drift lower to his hand, the blade which he held had been hidden in Hideki's chest.

His entire body began to shake, in horror, and fear. "W-Why!? Why!" He screamed out, his entire soul seemed to shake, and tremble, "Hideki...Why!? Why would you do this!?" He shouted, unable to believe what he was seeing, his voice seemed to cease as he watched Hideki's hand reach up to grasp his own eye, he heard the violent sound as the cord which kept his eye connected in his socket was pulled to the point it snapped.

He felt his food comming up from his stomach, his heart raced, part of the blood splattered onto his cheek, and the same action was repeated for a second time as Hideki remove dhis own eyes, and coughed blood splattering over his chest, as his tears began to fall, he couldn't...Couldn't accept that this had happened and when he heard Hideki's words, his hand released the Kunai and grasped onto Hideki's shoulders.

"W-What are you saying!? Y-You'll be there....Y-You'll see me grow up! Y-You'll be there to punch me when I g-get off course...Hideki you...You're my family...I...I'll find a medic...W-We'll get you healed up....T-Then we can go home...And just talk t-this through...Hideki....Please...Please...don't...Don't leave me...I don't want to be alone...Not...Not again.."

He stated the trembling of his heart and soul were unmatched, he had never had to experience murder...But this death....It was on his hand....And why exactly....Did It hurt him so much...? He wasn't sure....But one thing was for cetain...This pain...Meant that he was alive,  Pain was his friend....His ally...Pain would never betray his trust...Pain was predictable...Pain...Was his truth.

And as Hideki's body fell from his grasp, the young male collpased....Falling to his knees, with his head bowed...."H....Hideki....How...How could you..?" He asked, staring at the corpse as it bled out, the tears continuing to flow from his eyes as a steady torrent, the scarlet blood of his teacher....His brother...Stained the soil below him.

And the male, opened his mouth....And just screamed....Screamed until his lungs gave out...Til his throat hurt from the simple action, and after he was done screaming, he stared....At Hideki's body, unbelieving of what had happened...This blood...Was on his hands.* - Tue Oct 20 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) reached down to Hideki's hands and slowly he looked at these eyes Hideki hated so much, and with a single motion they were sealed away into a scroll, and Hideki's body was lifted into his arms.* - Tue Oct 20 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) decided...That the best place to burry Hideki...Would be in a place which never stayed in one spot...One which would symbolize his life, eternally flowing. This way he'd be able to explore the world for an eternity...Not shackled down by anything.* - Tue Oct 20 01:32:35 2015
