<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) simply sighed as he cracked his knuckles deciding that this would be a fairly interesting task, well it would've been if he didn't do this exact same thing later, he cracked his knuckles, and sighed. Putting on his gloves, he then proceeded to retrieve a shovel, inhaling and exhaling as he found a new plot of land, and slowly he dug his shovel into that of the ground, beginning to slowly dig into the dirt.

He was taking his time, he continued digging slowly by slowly. He continued forward, this would definately be problematic as he scratched his chin lightly, continuing to dig the holes, he tossed the dirt into a pile, he figured this would be ideal for his training. He knew he'd be considered strong after doing this a few more times.

Slowly after having finished digging the holes, he took a deep breath and decided to go and round up the bodies, this would be tiresome in and of itself, but regardless he cracked open a bottle of water and began to down it, taking a deep breath, he swallowed all the liquid. Before he tossed the bottle.

It was time to begin burrying them as he began to slowly find bodies, grasping them by the ankles as he slowly dragged them towards him, putting each body near a hole, he looked around trying to figure out which body deserved to be burried first, he wasn't all to sure which people lived the best lives. It was definately problematic.

But as he put the bodies next to the holes, he began pushing the bodies into the hole. Taking his time, allowing each body to rest comfortably in the grave he had dug, he wondered if these people deserved it, but he knew it wasn't his fault, so he wouldn't actually care he inhaled followed by a deep exhale. This was great, he smiled lightly.

But as he was done knocking the bodies into the holes, he began slowly knocking dirt into each of the graves, covering them all with dirt until they were covered, he sighed a bit that was the last of the three missions he had been assigned, and as such he returned to the Mizukage's side, before he approached Lera.* - Mon Oct 12 21:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her and smiled warmly before he looked up to the ceiling "I definately will, one of these days." He stated lightly.* - Mon Oct 12 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- You know. You'd think a desert would have hotsprings. - Mon Oct 12 22:51:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: U-Uh, Sure. - Mon Oct 12 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) patiently waited on the couch, he scratched his cheek a bit nervously, as his foot tapped the ground out of anxiousness waiting for her to return.* - Mon Oct 12 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) follows behind her, taking his time though for a moment he raced ahead just to hold the door open for her, he did attempt to mind his manners. * - Mon Oct 12 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as he looked at her as she turned around, such an odd gesture he was a bit baffled by what she meant, and he kind of stared for a moment, his brain not believing the most obvious answer.* - Mon Oct 12 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Take my hand. - Mon Oct 12 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We'll be flying. I'm too lazy to walk. Too lazy to hide my jutsu from you too. - Mon Oct 12 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) went wide eyes for a moment, as she spoke, a faint blush appeared on his face and then---Crushed, he realised he got his hopes up for nothing, but that didn't lower his embarrassment to much. As he extended his hand attempting to take hers in his own "F-Flying?" He wondered if that was possible he hadn't recalled seeing anything that would make him believe flight was possible.* - Mon Oct 12 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as they started floating "W-What?" He asked as he felt his feet leaving the ground, only then did he feel his body suddenly joly as she took off like a bullet shooting away, he felt his breakfast comming back up, but he struggled to keep it in, he had never moved at such intense speeds and honestly didn't believe it was possible, this would take some getting used to, as well as the tunnel vision.* - Mon Oct 12 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was hanging like a ragdoll in her grasp, the nausea very much apparent in his face, as he looks to Katsune, then down towards the ground below them. He nodded his head as if giving her an answer. Definately not good with heights or fast speeds. * - Mon Oct 12 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at the ground as he was finally released, and was happy he was back on his own two feet, and proceeded to run to the edge of the mountain and vomit before returning back several moments later seemingly recovered as he spoke "M-Maybe....Do y-you want to c-continue looking?" He asked wondering if the water would be unbearable.* - Mon Oct 12 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at the water as he spoke "I'm game...if you are..." He stated lightly taking a deep breath, feeling the heat radiating off of the water.* - Mon Oct 12 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked developing a blush as he looked at Katsune as she removed her clothes admiring her beauty, before his eyes were averted. He took a deep breath calming himself and focusing, he wondered why she picked such a complicated suit though. But he did like the color of her bikini, not that'd he'd say that...She'd probably kil.

But slowly he began to undo his fastens which held his shirt together, followed by his belt, finally he unzipped his pants, and laid them all in a neat pile with his shoes besides Katsune's as he slowly walked over to the woman, he seemed to be wearing a plain black trunks, but as he slowly sat beside Katsune he looked to her and asked.

"What's the verdict?"* - Mon Oct 12 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) slowly watched as she tested the water before submerging her foot, leg, and finally the entirety of her body. He felt his heart racing subtly, as he swallowed hard when she said the water was doable. And slowly he began to test the water himself, sticking his foot into the water he winced a bit as the heat touched his skin. But he felt his body slowly adapting to it, as he inhaled through his nose before sinking the rest of his leg into the water.

Eventually he worked up the courage to slide in fully.gasping lightly as it touched his bare chest, he wasn't much taller than Katsune afterall. So it was just a bit under his collar bone, for a moment he didn't say anything he closed his eyes and just embraced the warmth.* - Mon Oct 12 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not today probably, but maybe soon. - Mon Oct 12 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked to her as he heard her speaking, and it was hard to contain the excitement which was plastered on his face. "Y...You don't know how much...This means to me...Kat." He stated, for a moment he ditched the honorific, hoping she wouldn't mind. He stretched his legs out ahead of him as well, his hand finding the ground between them, but not touching her own. He relaxed a bit. 

His heart was still beating at a faster pace, and he felt the heat, but oddly he felt relaxed.* - Mon Oct 12 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll teach you enough to at least hold your own against most other genin. - Mon Oct 12 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's....That's still more than enough, Thank you.. - Mon Oct 12 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. - Mon Oct 12 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You said you wanted to make my goals your own. - Mon Oct 12 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What'd you mean by that? - Mon Oct 12 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I...I meant that, I wanted....to see you become the Hokage once again, to get as strong as you desire. I'd like to be there and help you is all.. - Mon Oct 12 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Teaching him. . .is extremely irresponsible. - Mon Oct 12 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Mon Oct 12 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My goal isn't necessarily to become the Hokage. The village has a new kage now. It didn't when I told you that. - Mon Oct 12 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My goal is to make sure Konoha becomes what a friend of mine wanted. - Mon Oct 12 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If the Hokage is bad, I'll tell him to step down. - Mon Oct 12 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If he doesn't, I'll kill 'im. - Mon Oct 12 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Fair enough, My goal is to help you, and...As long as you're resolved, I won't question your actions. - Mon Oct 12 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as Katsune dunked herself in the water blinking, as he looked at her when she resurfaced, he looked up to the sky before he spoke "This water...Is pretty relaxing...Thanks for bringing us here." He stated lightly looking to her, as he closed his eyes lightly, not going to sleep just relaxing.* - Mon Oct 12 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) opens a single eye as his gaze settled upon her as he asked "Now why would you have done that~?" He asked lightly, watching her face casually assuming she turned back to face him.* - Mon Oct 12 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would slowly move attempting to rest a hand lightly on her shoulder, warm from the water it rested in as he spoke:

"Some times you just have to live without worrying about the consequences...Though, I hope you're not regretting it."* - Mon Oct 12 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her as she spoke before he spoke "Well, I'm not going anywhere anytime soon." He stated lightly, his hand falling back off of her shoulder and into the water. "You can count on it." He added, as he turned to face her he spoke "But this is a hotspring we should be relaxing, having fun!" He stated attempting to change the flow of the meeting so far.* - Tue Oct 13 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Thank you. - Tue Oct 13 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would slowly sigh as he spoke "Reeallaaaax. Or I'll harass you." The threat was very much real.* - Tue Oct 13 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "Not good enough." He stated lightly, his arm shot out and attempted to wrap around her shoulders lightly. Checking to see her reaction, he was fully prepared to die for this.* - Tue Oct 13 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as he noticed she wasn't reacting, at least not the way he expected. And as such a faint blush appeared on his face, as he stared ahead. Looking into the steam, as his arm remained wrapped around her shoulders, he was noticably nervous and as such he tried to change the topic. 

"S-So.....You s-seem to fit in well in Sunagakure..?"* - Tue Oct 13 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at her as she spoke, maybe making eye contact for a moment, his heart nearly skipped a beat when she moved closer. Feeling her hip against his own, his gaze was averted to the side, the blush on his face noticably deepening. He swallowed hard as he spoke:

"You...You have t-that personality, that attracts people n-no matter what you do. I-It's b-because you're unique.." He stated lightly all of a sudden he seemed to tense up lightly.* - Tue Oct 13 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her side pressed against his own, and his heart felt like it was pumped full of energy. Threatening to leap from his chest, as his blush covered the entirety of his face, he looked towards her for a moment, before averting his gaze almost immediately, much like her he didn't say anything.* - Tue Oct 13 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) scratched his cheek a bit, there was a sigh of relief, he was extremely nervous. "R-Right, I-I'll see you later then...It...I-It was fun." He stated, watching her sit on the rocks beside the natural spring, he took a deep breath before releasing it aiming to calm his heart.* - Tue Oct 13 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head as he inhaled taking a deep breath, he seemed to have calmed...Mostly, as he climbed out of the water, he wasn't as lucky  and as such he was soaked so he decided to rest at the edge of the water giving her privacy as she changed.

"Hey...Kat...I'm happy you came." He stated lightly staring ahead.* - Tue Oct 13 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) (*Index nodded his head as he inhaled taking a deep breath, he seemed to have calmed...Mostly, as he climbed out of the water, he wasn't as lucky  and as such he was soaked so he decided to rest at the edge of the water giving her privacy as she changed.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) stood up briefly he was wet, but he had to make a compromise, and honestly, he was fine going shirtless, at least more than he was fine going pants-less, so he slowly began drying himself with his shirt. Before he sighed, pulling on his pants, followed by his boots, He'd just have to let the shirt try off later. * - Tue Oct 13 01:18:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked towards Fujitora as he addressed him, his eyes focused on his instructor, as his shoulder length black hair swayed subtly.He stood upright as he spoke "I have....And that's what I desire." He stated, his voice was fully resolved, he took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a deep exhale. He set his gaze upon Fujitora's blade. His body seemed almost light, he had a goal, he had a purpose.

That much showed on his face, as he looked Fujitora directly in his eyes, showing an unwavering resolve.* - Tue Oct 13 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Good...First, let's go with the basics of Fuuinjutsu when being used in combat.. - Tue Oct 13 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he looked at Fujitora,slowly examining the seal formation he had etched upon the ground. Listening to his words carefully, he heard the stories of Fujitora's childhood, and they honestly intrigued him, Fuuinjutsu allowed for endless possibilities especially for a Strategist much like himself, he already had knowledge of the summoning of animals, but he wasn't sure if it was easier to seal organic or inorganic things.

Thanks to Fujitora's words one thing was cleared up listening to the male's words "Limiter Release Seal?" He repeated, but he wondered why but he didn't interrupt Fujitora as he spoke, he listened to his words about the risk, and for the briefest of moments he wasn't sure, Death wasn't included in Fujitora's list of Risks, but he knew it was always a risk. He wondered if his resolve was as strong as he originally believed.

But he didn't say anything not yet, but the look of a man deep in thought could be shown on his face, he was given an option but he knew one thing. One couldn't give power without taking it, It was the simple principle of give and take. "If I'm granted power..Who loses it?" He phrased that very awkwardly, he didn't want to harm anyone else in his desire for power, if he protected his family at the cost of someone else's life who was innocent.

Could they even respect him?* - Tue Oct 13 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath and sighed as he once again contemplated Fujitora's words, and the use of the word "Human." Did raise some curiosity, as he took a deep breath before exhaling as he nodded his head, looking to Fujitora he thought about the words he was about to speak. Before sighing to himself, he needed the power, and he trusted Fujitora not to engage in anything bad. He believed in his teacher as he then spoke.

"I believe I am ready." 

He once again sounded resolve, he couldn't risk not having the power neccessary if his friends...Family needed it. If it was a gift from Fujitora, he'd accept it.* - Tue Oct 13 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he took a deep breath inhaling followed by a brief exhale, his hands beginning to move together in a series of seals before his finger was bought to his mouth. And biting his thumb he drew blood, and he crouched down placing his hand against the sand, as a black seal appeared and immediately afterwards, there was a small puff of smoke, a small black and white kitten appeared. 

Picking up the kitten he laid it upon his head, before he watched what was going on.* - Tue Oct 13 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm.. - Tue Oct 13 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What, he can summon too!? - Tue Oct 13 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Nina, stay here and continue train your Fuuinjutsu.. Summon weapons from the basic seal ...I have someting with Index we must handle. - Tue Oct 13 04:04:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) turned to Nina as he crouched before the Nine year old, taking the kitten from his head he offered it to Nina. "Mind watching her for a bit?"* - Tue Oct 13 04:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Think you can do that Nina? - Tue Oct 13 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I guess. Better than being by myself again. - Tue Oct 13 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Great...Here's the mission then. - Tue Oct 13 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: No problem here. - Tue Oct 13 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hello Nina I'm Koji. - Tue Oct 13 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hey. - Tue Oct 13 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Are you a citizen of Suna as well? - Tue Oct 13 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Nope. - Tue Oct 13 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Alright...Let's go then Index. - Tue Oct 13 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Right. - Tue Oct 13 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at Fujitora and he took a deep breath, he wondered if he was getting in over his head. Walking to the table, he swallowed hard before he slowly approached it. Placing a single hand on the table he felt the coldness against his fingertips, and slowly he moved to lay down, he knew that Fujitora was telling the truth...He wondered if there was a possibility of insanity which went along with this.

So as he laid down upon the table, he looked at the various scientist who began tightening laces, and different kind of restrictive devices around his body and limbs, he tested it. He was unable to move. This scared him a bit, he wondered what he was getting into, he looked up to the ceiling, taking a deep breath as he aimed to brace his nerves.* - Tue Oct 13 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm, tell me, what are your elements when you became Genin? - Tue Oct 13 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Er... - Tue Oct 13 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Fire, Water, Earth and Lightning. - Tue Oct 13 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Good..Any would do.. - Tue Oct 13 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Huh? - Tue Oct 13 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was a tad bit nervous when the Scientist continued tightening the straps, around his body. Only then did he look to Fujitora, feeling the charka as the male rested his hand upon the center of his chest, he felt the heat gathering on his chest, and it spiraling outwards as it began to enter his body. But that was only the started, he was taking deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling aiming to maintain his heart rate.

But as the beast's chakra began to enter him, the boy's eyes widened, screaming out in agonizing pain, as he tried to pry himself free from the bindings which held him, his eyes immediately went blood shot, the veins on his forehead and arms standing strong, as he felt his entire body fighting off this foreign invader. The pain was something he had never felt before, it was like his skin was being carved away, as salt was placed onto it.

It was insane, how could he endure such a thing? Such pain was almost inhumane, but as it reached the peak, the boy slummped over on the table, as the remaining chakra was pushed into his body. Definately weakened beyond all belief, the pain had been more than enough to send him into a state of unconciousness. 

Slowly but surely the seal Fujitora had placed on his chest had taken form, acting as a barrier which would prevent the stolen remnents of chakra from escaping once it was skilled, the boy....He felt the beast's prescence, it was dominating....Intimidating, he feared it, and the beast knew it. But for now he was unconcious...Maybe he'd be able to escape the beast...If even for a moment.* - Tue Oct 13 05:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says:   - Tue Oct 13 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: His and the bijuus chakra should be mixing right about now... - Tue Oct 13 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was simply out, prbably out for the rest of the night, he was unconcious. Seemingly in a state which could be considered near comatose, his vitals were normal. But he was experiencing this weird sensation but now he didn't seem to have any signs of waking up. Not just yet, his black hair hung low over his face, and when he was given the numerous injections, he simply laid there unresponsive for the longest time.

Occasionally he'd stir, hearing the roaring of a monstrous beast inside of him, but it seemed distant, or maybe it was comming closer, he wasn't to sure, but regardless. He wondered if this was a good decision on his own part, he knew this would be a lot of work, and a lot of effort, but he figured he'd have to invest in both to gain the power he thought neccessary.* - Tue Oct 13 05:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) studied Hiroshi's appearance, as he simply stated "Index." He took a few more steps back he had originally expected Hitoshi to fufill the extra half of the gap. But he didn't mind. He focused on the man's appearance, his fists balled lightly before unclenching.* - Tue Oct 13 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) definately had no intention of standing there while Hiroshi ran up to him, so the moment Hiroshi spoke, the boy began gather chakra into the center of his palm, which began to gather into that of a ball of flames which spiraled around his hands, his hand shot forward tossing the ball of fire not at Hiroshi but the ground before him once the ball connected, it'd explode sending flames out from it's position. The attack was aimed to take out the male's ability to progress.

By throwing it in his path, he put the option of Hiroshi taking the ball of flames directly into the mix, or risking avoiding it which would slow down his movement, and possibly still result in light burns due to the aftereffect, thirdly, his intention was to use the explosion, to through sand into the air, hoping to target his opponent's eyesight. But he did take notice of the male's speed, and as such he hoped his strategy worked.* - Tue Oct 13 23:00:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) tottally won.* - Tue Oct 13 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You were impressive! - Tue Oct 13 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But go ahead and fight Trilliam. - Tue Oct 13 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: .... - Tue Oct 13 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath he definately wasn't a fan of earth users, but he didn't comment on it as of yet, and took a deep breath making some distance between him and where he believed Trilliam was. As he moved he made sure an attack from behind was impossible.* - Tue Oct 13 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath, he was expecting something similar from that of an earth User, that was why he had placed himself against the wall. He knew a lot of earth techniques dealt with pushing an opponent away, as well as Water Techniques. He wasn't all to sure of his opponent's strength, but he took point, staying against the wall would honestly minimize damage, and prevent him from losing his footing, since most likely it'd just be pressing him against the wall, at least his legs, but he took a deep breath.

Since Trilliam had presented himself, the boy---Once he got used to the mud moving against his body,he'd begin to weave a series of handseals. Inhaling followed by a deep exhale, as flames were released from his lips, conjuring up a fireball, which was shot towards Trilliam, the purpose of this fireball was to heat up the mud, which would make it less of a threat, allowing him to move without being weighed down by water weight. Secondly to target his opponent directly.* - Tue Oct 13 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath his opponent seemed to be following along as planned he took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a deep exhale, he was purposefully keeping to the use of a single element it was easier that way and didn't give insight as to his skillset, both hands were moved at his side, he had already identified that Trilliam used the earth element, and the male only had two places of attacking. Beneath or behind.

Chakra gathered at both of his hands, and flames danced across his palms, a single hand aimed towards the ground beneath him, and one aimed at the mountain's wall.* - Tue Oct 13 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: This kid thinks on his feet...it's not always so easy though. - Tue Oct 13 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiled a bit this was perfect, his hand shifted only a bit forward, to maximize time to moment Trilliam resurfaced, and the ball of flames was released aimed at the man's legs, he was taking advantage of having pre-charged his attack, as well as having aimed it down to his advantage. As well as utilizing the mud he had prehardened which was across his legs to negate some of the damage from his own attack.

The flames had they connected as originally intended would've been aimed at knocking Trilliam's legs from beneath him, and as such knocking his lightning ball off course, he wasn't sure about one thing regarding Trilliam's technique "Could he sense me? He must be able to because he read my positioning." He was prepared for this, and luckily Trilliam gave insight on a technique and it's abilities.

That was the reason he took such an od position, which left him open from either sides, he wanted to leave his opponent an opening that could easily be exploited, that was also why he had pre-charged his technique, so there'd be no delay from the firing.* - Tue Oct 13 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched the moment Trilliam hit the ground, his second hand was bought forward, aimed at the back of the male's head, that was why he had charged his technique in both hands, he knew that Trilliam would need to make a seal to utilize a Jutsu. But with the fire technique aimed at the back of his head, he smiled warmly. "I believe this, is my win?" He asked lightly, regardless of if the seal was still made, the time needed for the seal to be performed, and the formation of the clones, would be longer than the simply movement of his hand.

He stared down at Trilliam watching the man lightly.* - Wed Oct 14 00:14:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) immediately his chakra was recalled back into his palm, before he extended his palm to help him up. "I'm not sure about joining a team, I have a goal that I'd need to find a specific person to accomplish. But, I appreciate the offer." He looked at Trilliam, and in his head, in the back of his mind, he heard something...An animalistic voice. But he couldn't make out much of anything besides a roar which sounded almost agonizing and he didn't pay much mind to it, it was probably a figment of his imagination.* - Wed Oct 14 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, you beat Trilliam... - Wed Oct 14 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So, where do you come from? - Wed Oct 14 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I come from a small mountain settlement. - Wed Oct 14 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Around Kumogakure. - Wed Oct 14 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And where did you receive yoru training from? - Wed Oct 14 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: My grandfather, the rest was self taught. - Wed Oct 14 00:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Did I pass? - Wed Oct 14 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, Trilliam, if I don't see Hassan before you do, let him know that Index is fine to be genin so long as he is approved by the Lord himself. - Wed Oct 14 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: I'll tell him and then he wull be officaly codenamed Charcoal. - Wed Oct 14 00:32:00 2015
