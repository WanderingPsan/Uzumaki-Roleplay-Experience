<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) simply sighed this would be a fairly easy task although definately time consuming he knew the dangers of touching dead bodies. Most of which had begun to rot, he wasn't playing around with these corpses any longer but he sighed to himself, first he went to the store and purchased a pair of gloves before he purchased a shovel, with a light sigh he wondered how this would go, he figured the most efficent way would be to dig the graves since there were bodies everywhere.

So once he began digging the graves, he piled the dirt up beside each of the graves he seemed to be taking his time, he did want to make sure this was done correctly, because if he didn't make sure, he was confident he'd be sent back to correct his mistake and that honestly wasn't ideal for him, so as he dug the holes with the shovel, the dirt was simply piled up and he sighed followed by a light yawn.

This time he slowly decided to go and round up the bodies taking a deep breath, he inhaled followed by taking a deep breath,dragging the first corpse which happened to be that of a female shinobi he dragged her corpse towards one of the holes before leaving here there, before repeating the process several times over until he had successfully pulled one body for each hole he had dug, he also wore a face mask.

He knew that if he got sick from doing this it definately wouldn't be good, because it seemed like only bad sicknesses came from dead bodies, not like good stuff would come from the dead. He yawned subtly finding this process almost interesting but he didn't say anything he had decided it was time to go burry the bodies, as he looked at them first starting with the man's body, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale.

Approaching her body his hands wrapped about her ankles, and slowly he pulled her forward until her body fell into the hole, before repeating the process several times over, he figured this would build his stamina and influence around the neighborhood, but he yawned taking a deep breath. Deciding he was almost done with what he was scheduled to do, so as he slowly took care of laying the bodies in the hole.

 He slowly picked up his shovel and began shoveling shovel-fulls of snow, before tossing it into the hols, taking his time as he began burrying their corpses, he seemed almost sated, this mission was his purpose for the time being so he couldn't ignore it, so he had to take it's lessons and continue to move forward, that would help him in the long run.

So with a gentle sigh, he had finished covering each of the holes he had dug and scratched his chin that surprisingly wasn't a hard mission save for the time it consumed it wouldn't have provided him much difficulty on a normal day so he decided it was a good time to go collect his pay.* - Sun Oct 11 21:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) released a fake tear as he spoke "T-That hurts me S-Senpai." He stated dropping to the ground in front of the Mizukage with his hands placed firmly upon the ground, he slowly took a deep breath, inhaling followed by an exhale. His legs were extended behind his body, as hee slowly began to lower himself down to the ground, perhaps the easiest portion of this exercise known as a pushup.

The hard part came when he had to push back up, and he slowly yawned, deciding to go about doing this with swift motions, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale. He knew he had a lot to do, but he simply sighed, his body going through the motions of pushups he simply inhaled followed by a deep exhale, his body moved swiftly and efficently not to say he was physically strong.

He was definately not the strongest person you'd meet physically, his motions were swift, and about when he was half way done, he felt the tension growing in his muscles and silently cursed, but he didn't really mind as of yet, a faint bead of sweat rolled down his forehead, as he continued to do his pushups as instructed. Once he reached his quota he slowly moved back into a sitting position.

Sitting in front of the Mizukage, and possibly as an act of not caring, not really meant for disrespect, he'd attempt to rest his head against her legs as she stood.* - Mon Oct 12 02:36:35 2015
