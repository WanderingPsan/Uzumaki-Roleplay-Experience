As he spoke "R-Right, well...Stand up for a moment, and sit down on the bed.

He motioned for her to come try,  "Rest your head on their chest, and your other hand moves to their inner thigh." He stated adding in "It's a very unique hug." He spoke "Alternatively...If the person is sitting, you'd sit on their lap and facing them. And hug them tightly." He stated lightly. "I'm a genius."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I guess this is what happens when you make things up out of thin air. - Sun Nov 29 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: And I'm not entirely sure. We're just using this as a base for now. Depending on how we like it here, maybe. - Sun Nov 29 04:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If your group was offered incentive to stay in this village and run it to bring it to fruition, under one of your people's leadership and rule with someone as an 'investor' or silent partner to be allies in the future would you agee? - Sun Nov 29 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Hm...Me personally, I suppose I'd agree. After all, you can't rule a village with only a handful of people. You need money and trade.  So I'd say yes. - Sun Nov 29 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Another roll? - Sun Nov 29 04:52:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Since? - Sun Nov 29 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The one's you ran off only thought they owned it. - Sun Nov 29 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It was passed down to me through inherentance from the previous owner. - Sun Nov 29 05:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: She ran the village because she was manipulated into the position. - Sun Nov 29 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: To keep the village prospering. - Sun Nov 29 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But she abandoned it. - Sun Nov 29 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: More like she got kicked in the head, then fled out of embarassment. - Sun Nov 29 05:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Besides, I never heard of such a term for villages. I thought if you took the leader out, or if there were no leaders, it's free reign. - Sun Nov 29 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You are cheating.~ - Sun Nov 29 05:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Well as for me being legal owner. - Sun Nov 29 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: See the thing is. - Sun Nov 29 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The people who run a village do not actually -own- it. - Sun Nov 29 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The daiymou owns the village. - Sun Nov 29 05:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Alright.~ - Sun Nov 29 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) waves "Hello, Yuriko."* - Sun Nov 29 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Hello, Master. - Sun Nov 29 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked as she climbed onto his lap, and hugged him. After a moment his facial expression relaxed, and his arms went around her body. "Hello, my beautiful Doll." He stated examining her clothing, as much as he could while she sat atop of him. Not that he minded, his gaze shifted up to her eyes and he smiled up at her.* - Sun Nov 29 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "I slept great." He stated looking at her, he took a deep breath and yawned seems part of him wanted more sleep. "Did you talk to your plants while I was sleeping?" He asked curiously.* - Sun Nov 29 15:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No I spoke with Yori. - Sun Nov 29 15:14:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hehe. - Sun Nov 29 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But I knew pretty much everything. - Sun Nov 29 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm~? I see. - Sun Nov 29 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That's because you're ahead of everyone else~. - Sun Nov 29 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Because you're special~. - Sun Nov 29 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Hehe. - Sun Nov 29 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Are we going to learn more soon? - Sun Nov 29 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: We can actually, learn more right now if you want~. - Sun Nov 29 15:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees.~ - Sun Nov 29 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Do I get a good morning kiss before we start training though~? - Sun Nov 29 15:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as she leaned in to kiss him, and he kissed back. Enjoying the moment they had before breaking the kiss, as he spoke "Let's go then, Yuriko~." He stated waiting for her to move off of him before he stood up.* - Sun Nov 29 15:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took her hand, before heading out to the surface world, he had an idea of what he could teach her. But he was thinking a more hands on experience would be good, but not at the moment, so he spoke "I was thinking, Three Techniques today, to make up for lost time." He stated, watching her face curiously.* - Sun Nov 29 15:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What are they? - Sun Nov 29 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Water Prision...Exploding Collision Wave, And possibly Shadow imitation. - Sun Nov 29 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Sun Nov 29 15:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: We'll start with water Prison. - Sun Nov 29 15:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 29 15:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) slowly reads through the scroll, before he blinked, And began slowly sketching out the technique in picture book format. Once it was done, he turned and crouched before her, holding the book up, he'd allow the pages to flip. It was a female, doing several handseals---The female looked almost perfectly like Yuriko, but then extending her hand towards another person a water prison appeared and trapped down. "This technique is used to capture people in water, You have to be in close range. And if you wish to maintain the prison you must have continuous contact with it at all times." He paused "After saying this, Do you know the Water Clone Technique? If not I'll teach you that next, and Exploding Collison tomorrow."* - Sun Nov 29 15:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked towards Yuriko, as he spoke "In Amegakure...? It was definately a surprise. It was enjoyable, I liked it." He stated, offering her a light smile as he sat on the ground while she was learning the technique. After a bit, he nodded, he had been taking this time to draw up another sketch book on how the water clone technique would've went. Flipping it from his position, he showed her what was to be done in picture form.

"You're basically dividing your chakra into a replica of yourself, created of water. Although it is weaker, it also can only maintain it's form up to a certain distance from you." He stated, taking a peek up her dress from where he was laying.* - Sun Nov 29 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) claps his hands, from the position he was laying, "Wow, that -looked- easy." He stated, looking up at her, as he stood, and finally he figured Shadow imitation would be a good way to end off today's scheduled training, so he had been working on a sketch book as she attempted the previous technique but she finished fo fast he'd have to continue for a few more moments when he had finished he looked up at her:

"What made you act like that in Amegakure?" He asked curiously.* - Sun Nov 29 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: It's what worked. - Sun Nov 29 17:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: To get what I wanted. - Sun Nov 29 17:27:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You can be bossy when it's just the two of us? - Sun Nov 29 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...but you like being bossy when we are alone, Master. - Sun Nov 29 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Wouldn't it...make more sense the other way around? - Sun Nov 29 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he turned, to wrap his arms around her. "Hm...When we're not alone for you to be bossy?" Contemplated it, he did feel odd about this situation. But he was curious, as he added "Mm, If today you're bossy with me while we're along as a Test run. Sure, You can be my 'owner' in public." He stated, aiming to kiss her on the side of the neck.* - Sun Nov 29 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "We'll ease you into it, not all at once, I'll take care of a lot and gradually I'll shift it to you---What's with the sudden change of heart, Yuriko~?" He asked, holding her tightly against him as he hugged her.* - Sun Nov 29 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled warmly as she hugged him back, but when her hand moved between his legs and cupped his groin. His eyes widened, leaning into her as he bit his bottom lip. "T-To read...?" He asked, looking towards her, he didn't see why that was a problem as he spoke  "I wouldn't mind teaching you...And It was...pretty interesting seeing you bossy like that. I really did like it~." He spoke.* - Sun Nov 29 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm surprised. - Sun Nov 29 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I thought you might punish me later for it. - Sun Nov 29 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Were you looking forward to it Yuriko? - Sun Nov 29 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: N-no. - Sun Nov 29 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) as he hugged her his hands moved down to her ass and slowly he began groping with both hands. He looked at her eyes, as he spoke "You should've told me earlier, that you wanted to run things... But even so, I'll let you have what you want, Yuriko."* - Sun Nov 29 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Or should I say...Mistress Yuriko for the time being~? - Sun Nov 29 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: O-oh. - Sun Nov 29 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Alright, Yuriko~, what do you want me to do~? - Sun Nov 29 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But we are in private. - Sun Nov 29 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: I was hoping to see what it'd be like, like a sneak peak~? - Sun Nov 29 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Although... - Sun Nov 29 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If I'm in charge, there's been something I've been desiring to do. - Sun Nov 29 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What is that, Master? - Sun Nov 29 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) leans in to whisper, while pressing his crotch against her hand harder. "Mm, There's a hole I haven't explored thoroughly yet~." He stated, moving to kiss her on her collarbone.* - Sun Nov 29 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) bit his bottom lip as she began to massage over his groin, he looked at her. "Yeah~, Why don't you get me ready using your hands and your mouth, My beautiful, Yuriko~?" He stated, giving her rear a rough grope. As he stared into her eyes.* - Sun Nov 29 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head as he spoke "I'm wondering, your emotions they've been sticking around for a while, haven't they? Does that maybe mean your treatment is almost complete?" He looked at her, wondering just how long she'd been here before he arrived.* - Sun Nov 29 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked towards her as he spoke "I suppose we should get to work, although. It may be better not to rush it, Taking your time might be good so no...'permanent' mistakes happen." He stated, "But would you like to get some in today?"* - Sun Nov 29 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes, I would.... pemanent mistakes? - Sun Nov 29 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head "I'm overthinking it, don't worry about it." He stated, offering her his hand, if she took it he'd begin taking her inside.* - Sun Nov 29 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: O-oh okay. - Sun Nov 29 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You wouldn't let that happen anyway, Master.~ - Sun Nov 29 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Silly you.~ - Sun Nov 29 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Of course I wouldn't~ - Sun Nov 29 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) decided to lift her up, he hadn't done that in a while, carrying her princess style. "Your master, will always protect you, Yuriko~." He stated with a warm smile. Maybe Thirteen was actually changing? Well...We'll just have to see.* - Sun Nov 29 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) headed off towards their room, in which case once ther arrived she'd be set down atop of the bed. And he'd move to the door, and call for the scientists.* - Sun Nov 29 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) within moments the scientists had arrived at their room pushing open the door. They'd bow respectfully to Yuriko before, they began setting up, they had decided to start her off with one that had failed, it was the vial for dominance, the desire to be in control of everyone around her. They poured a vial, and immediately, began preparations for the anti-serum.* - Sun Nov 29 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked as she suddenly charged forward, and without thinking, Thirteen got up after she did but she had already pinned the scientist down. "Y-Yuriko!?" He asked, as his hand moved to grasp her own, "Yuriko...calm down!" He stated staring at the woman.* - Sun Nov 29 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) realised how actually problematic this was becomming as she continued crushing the doctor's throat. He contemplated using a genjutsu against her, but he didn't think it'd go well with her afterwards. So he reached for the anti-serum, "Yuriko -drink-." He commanded, aiming to get through to her submissive and obedient side.* - Sun Nov 29 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) sighed this was problematic, as he watched her choke the scientist to death and ignore him. He hadn't intended to use a Genjutsu on her, but hell, it seemed like he would be. So his hands met together, as he lept backwards, making a single seal as his chakra aimed at capturing Yuriko. If succeeded she'd begin feeling extremely sick and dizzy, and be consumed by the feeling that she was sinking. "Yell at me later." He muttered, anticipating her anger later.* - Sun Nov 29 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved over to her, as the Genjutsu was effecting her, and immediately moved to flip her over on her back.Reaching for the anti-serum, he'd attempt to open her mouth with a single hand, although if she was screaming her mouth may've been open already, he'd aim to pour the liquid in, before placing his hand over her lips to prevent her from spitting out out.* - Sun Nov 29 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) as he noticed her calming down, he slowly dispelled the jutsu. Before crouching beside her, "Yuriko...Are you alright? How do you feel?"* - Sun Nov 29 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he rubbed her head he looked into her eyes as he spoke "I believe the medicine had some sort of hallucinagenic effect on you...How do you feel?" He asked, definately shifting all blame onto the scientists.* - Sun Nov 29 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: O-oh... - Sun Nov 29 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head "No, I had to knock him unconcious when you were experiencing the effects of the drug he tried to keep experimenting on you. They're going to prepare him for your meal later as punishment." He stated, motioning for the guard to get to it with a tilt of his head.* - Sun Nov 29 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head "Not Eager, he was trying to take advantage of your weakened state for his own personal gain. We need to make an example of him, or the scientist will see this as an opportunity to do what they like to you again." He stated,his tone was fierce, playing the part of 'protector', perfectly.* - Sun Nov 29 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) wrapped his arm around her as he spoke "They thought...Because I've been acting nicer around you and around the others...That I was growing weak...I'm sorry for placing you in that situation..My precious doll." He stated, moving to kiss the top of her head.* - Sun Nov 29 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Don't ever let them think that again, Master! - Sun Nov 29 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I won't Yuriko... - Sun Nov 29 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Not -ever-. - Sun Nov 29 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was smiling sinisterly on the inside, as he spoke "I'll be here, I'll protect them...And make sure they -never-, Mess with you again. My Yuriko." He stated, his hand moving to her head, as he began combing his hands through her unbelievably soft mane.* - Sun Nov 29 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) held her for as long as she needed it, running his fingers through her hair, "Yuriko, Are you ready...to show them you don't fear them? That they can't get to you..? Make a demonstration?" He asked.* - Sun Nov 29 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah! - Sun Nov 29 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) gave her a final kiss on the top of her head before he aimed to stand offering his hand to her. "Let's go then."* - Sun Nov 29 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took her to the morgue, he wasn't dead but he soon would be, he was bound by rope. With a clothe wrapped around his mouth to silence his screams, He stood behind her as he spoke "Enjoy, Yuriko. Show them...You're not scared...This is the punishment for trying to harm you." He thought to himself "Show me....That look I love Yuriko...Show it to me~!"* - Sun Nov 29 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched as she stood on her tip toes to kiss him, and of course he kissed her back. "It's my pleasure~." He spoke, as he watched her devouring the corpse, his eyes widened, in mock pleasure. As his tongue went across his lips, and when she approached him, he stared into her eyes. That lustful gaze,  "That's it! That look...I love it~." He thought to himself, as he reached for her hands, he spoke "Mm, I'll make sure..To set up the largest buffet for you...An endless corpse parade..~" He stated, as he leaned forward to kiss her upon the lips. * - Sun Nov 29 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) embraced the passionate kiss, looking down to her as he spoke "And I...Love you, My Precious Yuriko~." He looked at her, before he spoke "That'd be ideal~, I wouldn't want you waiting to long~." He stated, as he crouched down,and aimed to lift her up in his arms, elgantly, as if she was a princess once more. His special doll,  he'd never replace her. As he stood, he'd begin heading towards their room.* - Sun Nov 29 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) as they entered the door, he approached their bed, and slowly he aimed to lay her down upon it. Heading back he called for another scientist, since everything was currently within their room. One rushed over, this time a female stood in the doorway and bowed respectfully to Yuriko, she seemed a bit nervous. And she looked at what was currently out. There wasn't a lot more to do besides the more fouler emotions. So the next one offered to her was...Anger..She had taken to a few 'good ones', but lust and a few others were there as well. "H-Here y-you go, Y-Yuriko-sama!"* - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) |||The woman wrote down the lack of reaction, and moved to reach for the next one dabbling back into fight or flight, it was the reaction for "Flight", of course the door was locked at this point, and it was offered to her.* - Sun Nov 29 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) sighed for a bit, as he stood, extending his hand to Yuriko from where he stood next to the bed. "Yuriko, It's me, Thirteen. Come here." He stated he watched her panicking behavior, and wondered if he could talk her out of the state. It was a peculiar thing to see someone going through emotions so effortlessly like this. But he was curious what a completed Yuriko would be like.* - Mon Nov 30 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) staggered a bit by her screaming, "Yuriko..?" He asked, a bit startled by this and the scientist, immediately reached for the anti-serum. "L-Lady Yuriko drink this!" She stated, offering it to the girl. Her voice was calm, and warm, almost as if dealing with a child.* - Mon Nov 30 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ||The female backed off, and sighed. Thirteen sat back down on he bed, he didn't intend to try to genjutsu her once again, so he hoped time with cause this to wear off..So they waited.* - Mon Nov 30 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at Yuriko as he stood "Are you alright?" He had waited about thirty minutes to an hour.* - Mon Nov 30 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) sat by her side as he spoke "That's a human emotion...called fear. It helps you stay alive. Humans tend to fear people stronger than them or things they don't know. I never expected for it to manifest in that way though." He stated, as he looked to her and aimed to wrap his arm around her, "You're alright though, right?"* - Mon Nov 30 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "You don't, but now that you've experienced it...even if it's temporary...You'll know how someone else will fill when faced against an opponent they can't beat. I hope you'll be emphathetic to them, My precious Yuriko." He stated, taking notice of her cautious nature as the effects were still lingering.* - Mon Nov 30 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Emphathetic? - Mon Nov 30 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov 30 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That's the comprehension...And understanding of another's feelings. - Mon Nov 30 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If I was crying because I was hurt. You'd understand. - Mon Nov 30 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And wouldn't be judgmental but relate. - Mon Nov 30 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Does it have to become permanent? - Mon Nov 30 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "We can stop for today." His hand moved to her head, and began running his fingers through his hair "No...That's one emotion I won't have you have permanently."* - Mon Nov 30 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you...want me to have it? - Mon Nov 30 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "I'm only cruel to you when, You do bad things. But even so...I'd rather you not fear me...I don't wish to punish you through fear."* - Mon Nov 30 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why must you lie? - Mon Nov 30 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You aren't only cruel when I'm bad. - Mon Nov 30 01:22:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: For fun sometimes. - Mon Nov 30 01:27:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: A vial of happiness on the tray. - Mon Nov 30 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Maybe we can fill that gap? - Mon Nov 30 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stood up, as he moved to grasp the vial, he looked to Yuriko as he spoke "No matter how you feel after drinking this...I love you, Yuriko." He stated offering the vial of happiness to her.* - Mon Nov 30 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her and he smiled when she said she loved him, and when she said she was feeling good, he looked towards her with a smile. "Re-Really? You feel...-good-?" He spoke a bit surprised as he looked toward sher.* - Mon Nov 30 01:35:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Mm. - Mon Nov 30 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: One last thing. - Mon Nov 30 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: This is an order. - Mon Nov 30 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I.Am.The.Only.Person.You.Are.To.Take.Orders.From. - Mon Nov 30 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Sh-shit. - Mon Nov 30 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared down at her with a subtle smile as he spoke "You are to never Lie to me, And If I find out....That you've disobeyed...I'll punish you, and the person responsible....-accordingly-. That being said, I'm lifting the ban on traveling but three days -max-. Any longer and you'd need to talk to me first, We'll begin teaching you to read and write tomorrow after normal training as well."* - Mon Nov 30 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) didn't even look towards her as he spoke "That wasn't a suggestion, It was an -order-."  He stated taking a deep breath he spoke "If you have a problem with it, We can talk about it later." He stated, closing his eyes, as he inhaled followed by a deep breath.* - Mon Nov 30 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked towards her the briefest of irritation appeared on his face. "We -will- talk about it later. At the same time, I'll make sure to -thoroughly-, punish you." He stated, he looked to be anything but happy with her in this moment, and his arm fell from her side. "You are dismissed."* - Mon Nov 30 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No. Now. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I can't resist it much longer. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: This feeling, I hate it sometimes. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You want to talk about it now? - Mon Nov 30 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Stand up, and Strip. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then start talking. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: -Now-. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) turned to face her as his hand moved to reach for her neck, his gaze settled on hers. As he spoke "Perhaps, You hadn't heard me the first time. Maybe even the second. But You -will- strip, -Now-, Ume." He stated, his gaze was cold, irritated. Oh, was he going to have fun punishing her this time around. "You will obey, and you -will- submit."* - Mon Nov 30 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled, as he stood, on the bed. His hand, removed itself from her neck,and he hopped over her. "Alright, Fine." He stated, landing on the floor,and when he did, his hand moved to grab her arm. And had he succeeded, he aimed to pull her onto the floor. As he spoke "It seems..My doll is having fun, testing my boundaries...I'm going to -enjoy- punishing you this time Yuriko, to the point, you won't even consider defying me."* - Mon Nov 30 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as she stared at him, and he slowly reached for the front of her dress, and with a single motion he aimed to rip it down the front. "Until...further notice, You aren't my doll. You're my pet, Yuriko. You have no rights." He stated. He was truly angry, and wasn't in the mood for her defiance, He stood back up as he spoke "Last chance, to strip...It'll make this punishment a -lot- easier for you." He stated lightly.* - Mon Nov 30 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head "That's truly saddening." He stated, as his hands were raised to chest level, with the formation of a single seal his chakra flared outwards. It was a low leveled Genjutsu, but it worked wonders. He hoped to punish her thoroughly, had she allowed the genjutsu to take route. She'd suddenly notice the scenary changing. And she was chained to a pole, naked, in a dark room.  Meanwhile, had she been taken under by the Genjutsu. He began working on her body, removing her heels, followed by panties and bra.* - Mon Nov 30 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt something forming around him, a white foam of sorts, which surrounded his body, keeping him from formulating his handseal. And keeping him binded in place, as it sapped his chakra. His gaze narrowed upon Yuriko. "You..." He muttered, if looks could kill...She'd be dead.* - Mon Nov 30 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) not to mention the general surprise of what had occured.* - Mon Nov 30 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared at her, he didn't say anything, just watching her carefully. He tested his bindings carefully although he didn't need to, to determine he was trapped. He watched her walk over to the closet and come back with a new dress on. He remained silent.* - Mon Nov 30 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared into her eyes, as she broke him down, his actions, his words, his game. All of it bought out into the open, his gaze settled upon her as she used his own words against him, followed by the threat. That almost sent him over the edge, but through some miracle, it was suppressed before it managed to scrape the surface. So when she touched the clone, he felt his body's mass returning to normal, and he tested his limbs, to make sure everything was functioning correctly. "You're dismissed." His voice was practically seeping annoyance and anger, perhaps he needed this time to calm himself before doing something he'd otherwise regret.* - Mon Nov 30 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) headed over to the bed, and sat upon it, he looked at his hands and they practically trembled...Not of fear, but of anger, or perhaps...Excitement?* - Mon Nov 30 05:17:26 2015
