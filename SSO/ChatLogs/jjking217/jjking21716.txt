<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And I guess I could wear dresses. - Wed Oct 28 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head as she spoke, he probably had terrible recall, but he felt successful after having found something to replace the old one. As he approached Katsune, he offered his arm out, in a tea-handle type style. He wasn't expecting her to take ahold. But he had one of those grins on his face, that showed he was happy. "What kind of dress are you thinking about?"* - Wed Oct 28 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was definately surprised by her taking his arm, but he slowly nodded his head "I won't make you wear them, if you don't want to~." But he figured since he was given free reign, he could take this time to mess with Katsune a bit, as the section they walked through became....More suggestive. He headed into one of the rows and came back with two dresses.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) scratched his chin, as he went holding onto the chinese dress, while putting the first back,  comming back with another which was more of a normal dress.

Depending on her answer, he'd prepare to head to finally pick up her suit that he had destroyed.* - Wed Oct 28 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head before Ultimately putting the first one back, afterwards he ran to the 'repair' section, he had tossed in a lot of money, for them to take their time with her jumpsuit.  So it was probably really nicely repaired, or simply replaced, afterwards offering his arm to Katsune he'd head to the checkout after asking "Anything else you want before heading home?" Though of course, he had to pick up a piece of lingere, which came in the form of a 'see-through' lace dress, just to see her reaction, afterwards he'd place it down.* - Wed Oct 28 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiled a bit more at her reaction, as he leaned in to give her a kiss on the cheek, before proceeding to check out. After paying for the dress and suit, he slowly headed back home, "I don't suppose you want to go grocery shopping before we head home?" He toyed,  though he was considering the idea of taking her on a picnic or something of the sorts.* - Wed Oct 28 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What was that? I was busy training my shadowclone jutsu. - Wed Oct 28 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was actually paying attention, so when the clone appeared, he felt the boot connect with his crotch, and immediately went wide-eyed as pain radiated through his groin. Causing him to fall forward, with hands cupping his crotch, rolling, and groaning in moaning in pain. "D-Damn...T-That h-hurts." He muttered, he figured he was long overdue for a punch or kick anyway.* - Wed Oct 28 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) got his hand effectively kicked, which in return forced his hand to push against the already hurt area. Only causing him to roll around in more pain "Y-Yeah, They're perfect." He spoke, in an obviously sarcastic voice. "F-Fuck.." * - Wed Oct 28 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Must be because. . . - Wed Oct 28 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I haven't mastered the jutsu yet. - Wed Oct 28 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was being bullied by Katsune, and as such when he was kicked the air probably being knocked out of him. "Y-Yeah, I-I can see that." He stated raising a single hand to defend himself. "B-But....I feel like y-you've mastered it more than you care to let on." He muttered through inhales for air.* - Wed Oct 28 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) lost his virginity from that kick.* - Wed Oct 28 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: -omit- - Wed Oct 28 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as the foot connected,he recoiled, immediately hands went to cover, his butt  as he spoke "I...I think.I should.....Head home....Take a shower and think about life." He stated, "And my ass really hurts." He stated rubbing his butt, as he moved to stand, walking with a slight limp. Though he didn't seem to be honestly 'mad', He's come to not care much about this since it was Kat. Though the pain was motivation.* - Wed Oct 28 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after arriving home, he seemed to have recovered for the most part, save for an occasional rubbing his butt. As he the bags to Katsune, as he spoke "I don't suppose you want to join me~?" He spoke in a joking manner, but before he would've moved to the bathroom, he intended to go and grab a bottle of water, he did seem exceptionally dirty---Rolling in sand and dirt, because your girlfriend bullied you will do that to someone afterall.* - Wed Oct 28 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) reaches for a bottle of sake, which he set down on the table along with a bottle of water. Slowly he yawned, as he spoke "Give me a bit, I'll be in and out." And as such he went into his room, and grabbed some underclothes, before he headed into the bathroom and within no time, the water could be heard running in the bathroom.* - Wed Oct 28 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Making shadowclones made me tired. . . - Wed Oct 28 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after a few minutes, he's done washing himself off, along with washing his hair, so he steps out drying himself off. Before putting on his underclothes, which consisted of a sleeveless T-Shirt, and boxers, as he returned to the Living room, he looked at Kat, while drying his hair off thoroughly, before the towel was tossed into his room, he observed how she hugged the pillow, looking over her frombehind the couch "Looks like someone's enjoying herself~" He stated with a light laugh.* - Wed Oct 28 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) while Kat was sleeping, he had decided, to lay in front of the couch, sitting up with his back against the front, while sitting on the floor.* - Wed Oct 28 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) noticed some movement, as he looked up to her "Hey, How was your nap?" He asked lightly, before his gaze returned to the book he was reading.* - Wed Oct 28 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: H-hhm. - Wed Oct 28 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good. - Wed Oct 28 22:55:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I do....? - Wed Oct 28 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yep~ .."I love Cats..." - Wed Oct 28 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ..."I want to hold them and squeeze them in my arms." - Wed Oct 28 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ....Plus some other stuff, I'd rather not repeat. - Wed Oct 28 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . . - Wed Oct 28 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) didn't say anything for a moment, before he spoke "I'm just messin' with you." He stated with a light laugh, as he closed his book turning his head slightly, to look at her. * - Wed Oct 28 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Oct 28 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: H-hmm....? - Wed Oct 28 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Dozed off again. - Wed Oct 28 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiled lightly, as he rested his book on the table, as he spoke "I suppose all that  'training' with your shadow clones really tired you out?" He asked, going with it, though it was more in a sarcastic manner than in actual belief.* - Wed Oct 28 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Oct 28 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Wed Oct 28 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You know....This floor is really uncomfortable. - Wed Oct 28 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Want a pillow? - Wed Oct 28 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) pouts a bit, as he turned fully to face her as he spoke "I actually see something much better." He stated looking at her. * - Wed Oct 28 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Cushion. . .? - Wed Oct 28 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would suddenly attempt to leap on the couch, with one leg on eitherside of her own. After his attempted pounce, he'd say "Nope~ I'll give you one more guess." He'd state, aiming to place one arm on either side of her arms, he had a childish smile almost.* - Wed Oct 28 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) leans foward, bringing his face close to her neck as he'd plant  kiss on the back of her shoulder as he spoke "Yeah~, Kat." He stated, purposefully misunderstanding. Surprised by her turning over, his blush was faint, and more on the developing side of things.* - Wed Oct 28 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) moved his left hand to her side, and moved it down about half way. Before he spoke "Kat, I've been thinking." He paused for a bit, leaning in a bit closer, closer "You're probably the best thing that's ever happened to me." He stated lightly. * - Thu Oct 29 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiled a bit, as his hand moved further down her side if permitted, stopping at her hip as he spoke "I guess you haven't~." He spoke lightly, admiring her beauty. He felt his blush becomming more pronounced, as he hovered over Katsune, he figured if he wanted to. This would be an ideal time to get his 'payback', for her beating him up. Though it wouldn't be payback in any sense of the word.* - Thu Oct 29 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched her for a moment, Kat was hard to read at times, but his hand slowly moved in a circular motion against her hip. Before drifting over atop of her butt, he'd leave it there for a moment, his heart was racing but he honestly didn't want to make Kat uncomfortable, so occasionally a glance was sent her way.He'd apply a light bit of pressure, before, allowing his fingertips to gently run across the fabric which seperated them from her butt. And he swallowed hard.* - Thu Oct 29 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) with his left hand, gently caressing her rear, it'd transition into a light kneading motion of her butt while his right hand. Slowly traced along her thigh, going down to around the center of her leg. Before aiming to come back up, slowly along the inside of her legs. Gentle motions, though he stopped before he reached her inner thigh. A gaze was sent towards, her butt, and he swallowed hard.* - Thu Oct 29 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked, as he felt the softness of her butt against his fingers, mixed with the texture of the body-suit, he could feel her warmth. Which caused his heart to race, slowly his right hand, began trailing further up. Should he have been permitted, his fingertips, would lightly run across her inner thigh. Trailing upwards, but once again stopping before he moved onto anywhere else, slowly he relaxed his hand, and gently carressed, following the same pattern of circular motions. * - Thu Oct 29 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was contemplating stopping, he didn't want Katsune to be mad at him, if he continued...But honestly, maybe he was overthinking? He figured, he'd know after this. With one final grope of her butt, his right hand found it's mark, attempting to move between her legs, and slowly he'd extend two fingers, running them along her sex through her body suit, applying a bit of pressure, but not a lot just enough so that they can be felt. He'd observe for a reaction, but had there been none, he wasn't sure what he'd do.* - Thu Oct 29 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked away for a bit, as he retracted his hand, his blush was definately visible but part of him felt like maybe he shouldn't have done that. "Y-Yeah....Good idea.." He stated, as he moved from atop of her, heading to the door without a moment's hesitation, for whatever reason, he was trying to avoid her gaze.* - Thu Oct 29 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) stopped at the door, his heart was racing. As he slowly turned to face Katsune, his embarrassment was very much apparent. He wasn't sure what he should say, But he knew one thing was for sure....He needed a drink, and slowly he headed to the kitchen---Where was he honestly going in his underwear and T-Shirt? He'd probably have a good laugh about this later, as he reached for a bottle of sake. He sighed, looking at it, before twisting off the cork, he raised it to his lips, and took a deep breath. Placing it between the two of them.

"Any....Suggestions?"* - Thu Oct 29 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at Katsune as she scooted closer, feeling her hip against his own. He looked down at the bottle. "Then....We can...lay around for a bit longer." He stated. As he attempted to wrap an around her shoulders, though he seemed a bit nervous and embarrassed to even attempt it.* - Thu Oct 29 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: H-hhmmmm. - Thu Oct 29 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Such a good jutsu. . . . - Thu Oct 29 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sighed a bit, as she leaned in, he closed his eyes, not out of tiredness,  just for the sake of closing them only opening them briefly when he felt Katsune move to summon the clone. He looked at the bottles of Sake. But once again, he didn't  say anything, he just looked at the floor in front of him. Occasionally stealing glances towards Katsune.* - Thu Oct 29 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) slowly sighed, he still felt like he was in the wrong, as his left hand was raised to his cheek. He scratched it out of nervousness, before he spoke "I...I'm..." He paused for a bit, finding it very awkward to continue his sentence, but it was fairly obvious where he was going. He turned his head a bit, as much as he could without it being uncomfortable. Looking at Katsune, as he swallowed hard, searching for the right word.* - Thu Oct 29 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Thu Oct 29 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) offered no resistence, as his hand was grabbed, before being held over her lap. He wasn't sure what was going on, but he made no attempt to resist. His thumb was quite easily manipulated, before he watched as she guided it to the dark purple cloth over her crotch, and immediately his face lit up, feeling his finger being guided into the cloth. He swallowed hard, his eyes were practically glued to his hand. He resisted the urge to move. He felt his heart racing as if it was practically trying to leap from his chest. 

* - Thu Oct 29 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) swallowed hard, as his thumb was pushed further into the purple patch, feeling Katsune's skin against his thumb, his heart continued to race. He felt something velvetty in texture rubbing aginst his thumb. And for an eternity, it felt like his hand was there, it felt like the world had slowed down time, and everything was simply gone, besides him and Katsune.

He felt her lift his thumb once again, before being pushed back in, he felt his own body heating up, and arousal was definately creeping into him. Which was fairly obvious due to the bulge which had started to rise in his boxers, he felt the soft flesh as he was maneuvered by Katsune, he was curious but at the same time. He didn't seem to mind, he was simply taken away.

After a moment, he realised that his hand was pressed against her crotch, he was almost taken back. He was so focused on the sensation of his thumb, he had zoned almost everything else out. He was practically speechless, his mind was in all kinds of places, thinking into the meaning of her words.His body felt hot. And after a moment, he looked over to Katsune and saw her gaze was averted. He didn't know what to say, he seemed to be left speecless a lot in recent times.* - Thu Oct 29 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her removing his thumb, but allowing his hand to rest where it currently was atop the dark patch between her legs. He looked at her, before, slowly he felt her pushing his hand down, between her legs. And for a moment it felt like his heart stopped, he felt bare flesh against his two outter fingers, and felt the heat from Katsune's body against his palm. 

Was taken by the feeling of Katsune closing her leg around his hand, sandwhiching him in place, as she rested her face on his arm, he felt said arm finding it's place between her breasts. Creating an entirely new influx of emotions, he was completely taken by the sensation of Katsune embracing his arm, and wasn't aware of his own problem which seemed to be growing by the second.

Closing his eyes lightly, he focused on the sensations against his fingers, and the warmth of the girl beside him, and suddenly it felt like his heart started again...Maybe it was simply because he started to breath once again, he heard her speak, but there was nothing he could honestly reply to. The emotions he felt, the sensations, he was sure, were only those that could be caused by Katsune herself, and he wouldn't trade them for the world.* - Thu Oct 29 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked towards Kat's clone as it appeared, and kneeled before the original, he saw as she took the bottle of sake, and rested it on the ground, before he noticed, it beginning to work with Katsune's body suit, hearing the popping as parts of the suit were unfastened, before the clone began to pull. And honestly, his  brain hadn't connected the dots until he saw the lower part of her clothing sliding off.

Revealing more of her skin, which drew his gaze, to her bare legs, as the bottom part of her suit was removed. He felt her bring her legs together more, and once again he swallowed hard, he hadn't even acknowledged the clone vanishing, as his focus was drawn to the original. He was speechless, taking in all that Kat wished to teach him.

"W-Wow.." Was all he managed to mutter, in a subconcious way, he was in a different world, he honestly wondered if this was anything more than a dream. He took notice of her skirt, and assumed it was attatched to the upper Body's attire, if not an accessory all together.* - Thu Oct 29 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her grasp on his arm shift, before his hand was worked like a puppet once again. Causing his fingers to rub against her her panties, his eyes transitioned to focus on the movements of his hand. He felt the friction of his fingers against, the fabric of her panties. His eyes glanced along her lower half, before tailing up, and catching notice the little spaces for buttons. But he said nothing, he felt a gush of heat rush over his body.

He was almost painfully hard beneath his boxers, but his focus remained on Kat, he was to busy to worry about himself. Occasionally he swallowed hard, to keep himself from drooling at the sight. And he had to check himself to make sure he was breathing, because his breath was continuously taken away.* - Thu Oct 29 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her legs open up, freeing his hand a little giving him a little room to work. But even so, he felt her moving his hand against her innter thigh, before pushing it against the flesh and rubbing it.  He looked towards her face for a moment, before slowly the tips of his fingers began to move along her inner thigh, looking  to where his hand was, he'd slowly attempt to move it up her inner thigh, maintaining the same amount of pressure she had applied, before he found her panties. 

He was taking in the warmth and softness of her lower body, and he was taken away. As his fingers inched closer they slowly began moving across space between her panties and her leg. Before drifting towards the center, he'd swallow hard. As two fingers were extended he'd attempt to begin rubbing should she permit him to.* - Thu Oct 29 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt his fingers slowly moving along her bare sex. And he swallowed hard, as his gaze settled upon her flower, he looked up towards her face as she hug his arm tightly once again. He applied a bit more pressure, as he traced the tips of his fingers around the outer-lips, taking his time, he had never experienced something such as this before.

He definately...Was immersed, in the sensations due to his touch. He wanted to make sure Kat wasn't dissapproving of his movements in anyway, thus probably gave away his obvious inexperience, had she not detected it earlier.* - Thu Oct 29 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her grasp his hand, as it was removed from between her legs and placed atop of his own lap. He swallowed a bit hard, out of nervousness, and finally he became aware of his own problem. Leaning forward towards Kat, he aimed to plant a kiss on her cheek. He didn't say anything not yet, there was something he himself needed to make cerrtain of and it was becomming verfy obvious that what he had to do. And he slowly stood as he spoke "I'll....See you in the morning." Embarrassment definately showed on his face, but he did look at Katsune and offer her a light smile.* - Thu Oct 29 02:46:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as Katsune kneeeled down he took a deep breath and nodded his head, deciding to watch the entireity of the technique she was showing him. He took notice of her words, and nodded, his head,  it'd be fairly interesting to lean, let alone use in battle. That was something he gathered from simply the first few moments of listening to her, and watching. 

He followed her gaze back to the ground, and took notice of the words she used. He realised that her use of the word shove was probably spot on, and he nodded his head,  he wondered if this technique could be used in a similar manner to Fire-run, he figured it'd be great to try out eventually so he smiled, running a single hand through his hair.

He found the idea, of the technique being able to be manipulated almost beautiful, and for one such as himself who maintained high reserves of chakra, this would only work on his favor, he had a few questions, about the uses of this technique, at least in the battlefield, but he figured he could ask his questions at a later date.

He partially wondered how durable they were, since she put it out that they could be used as a Shield, but he figured that'd rely on how much chakra he put on reinforcing the earth which was being used . He nodded his head, before he sighed to himself, deciding this would be another technique which would cause him to put in some work.

But slowly, he decided to work on the transition from a standing position, to dropping down to a single knee, with his hands placed against the ground. He focused, on this transition but he felt like this would be a pain, and could get him killed if he didn't time his transition correctly, there was a subtle smile on his face.

He understood this wouldn't simply be a task he could just do and be done with, he figured it'd take time and work. So he had to put both in one hundred percent, as he looked towards Katsune, she was his motivation, and for her he needed to get stronger, he'd unveil how he felt should they both survive the war, he hoped they would.

He knew war was a hazardous place, but he wouldn't do anything foolish, and he already knew she wouldn't. So He began focusing on his chakra, inhaling followed by a deep breath, as he once again went through the transition from standing to placing his hands upon the ground.

With his chakra being sent into the ground, he focused on 'shoving it in', concentrating on the effect he hoped to 'reap' from this practice. He caught parts of Katsune and Kilm's conversation but simply sighed, maybe she was right. But he shook that idea out of his head, as his chakra began to manipulate the dirt beneath the surface.

Slowly spikes began to rise, propagating by the second, as they turned into large spikes, which shot from the ground. Threatening to impale, some unforeseen target, he took a deep breath and sighed, as his hands were lowered to his side, a single hand moved through his hair, as he stared forward. He inhaled sharply through his nose, and exhaled through his mouth.

Rising to a standing position, he looked towards the Duo and nodded his head, as he clenched and unclenched his fists. Before looking at his handiwork he felt like he had completed the technique, at least as thoroughly as had been expected, as he turned and gave Katsune a thumbs up. He was fine with his current handiwork, and as such he felt as if he had gathered a moderate understanding of the technique.* - Thu Oct 29 12:03:37 2015

As he whistled, impressed by the technique, he figured there were probably, numerous uses for such a thing in battle, besides the generic, if you get hit.  He smiled to himself, but besides that he didn't say anything. Besides "I'd appreciate it, Kat."* - Thu Oct 29 12:10:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he took a seat upon the ground taking out one of the many scrolls he had gathered, and unraveling it he began to read it's contents, taking his time he saw no reason to rush, this would be an easy learning exeperience. So he was fairly excited. Taking a deep breath he opened the scroll and began to read about the technique known as Kaze Bakuhatsu:

Tracingn his finger along the text he read."Using a short blast of air from their hand the user is able to propel themselves in any directions with considerable force."After having finished reading that small portion he was fairly annoyed about the small amount of information which had been offered by the technique, regardless he still had a lot to do.* - Thu Oct 29 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath he had yet another scroll to read, Oh Joy. So he inhaled followed by a brief exhale, as he raised his hands to chest level, before placing them together. He proceeded to crack his knuckles before running a single hand through his hair, he smiled briefly, as he understood this was definately a defensive technique, he smiled to himself. Before he looked forward, taking the scroll.

He rested it upon his lap, before undoing the fasten in which case, he looked at the name of the scroll which was named "Mud Wall." He nodded his head, as his tongue trailed across his lips, he realised this would be a fairly interesting technique to learn so he'd give it his all,  With a gentle sigh, he traced his finger along the text, before ultimately finding his position as he began to read:

"The user creates a solid wall of earth as a form of defence. Chakra is either converted to earth within the body and then spat out to form the wall or the user can manipulate pre-existing earth to form the wall. The earth then instantly rises up and takes form. "After reading the first portion he was definately taken by it, it was a defensive jutsu which would allow it to take hits, atop of it being chakra enhanced.

So he decided to press onward and began reading the next part of the scroll which stated."The barrier itself is also coated with chakra, making its strength incomparable to that of a normal mud wall. Because of the earth's special characteristics, the wall is highly resistant against, for instance, fire and water."* - Thu Oct 29 17:27:02 2015
