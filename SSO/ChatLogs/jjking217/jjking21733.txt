<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Do what you want. - Wed Nov 18 02:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're missing the point, Index. - Wed Nov 18 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: -That- truly saddens me. - Wed Nov 18 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Then tell me what the point is - Wed Nov 18 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) contemplated the question, as he took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a brief exhale. "You know what Ortho, You want to know what we've done? Yeah, I've played the game with her. But really, in all honesty, You don't seem to care much. Seems like you're getting along pretty fucking well,  You're so ---- Fixated on this girl. We haven't had sex, and the game didn't go far. But this---This fucking questioning. Who the fuck are you Ortho?" 

He was definately pretty irritated, his eyes focused on Ortho's and without blinking, a redness creeped into his eyes followed by the developing of a single tomoe, "This time, I'm saying this. We aren't allies, we aren't friends, and we sure as hell -aren't- brothers. But we're trapped in the same -fucking- boat, Because of the decisions we made. Whether we work together to come out on top, or do out own fucking things is up to you Ortho." He paused.

"But I will not pity your situation, I will not apologize. And I will not back down. If you want a fight, I'll be more than happy to give you one." His blood was practically pumping at this time...Anger, rage. * - Wed Nov 18 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Then I'd have you know. - Wed Nov 18 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Do you know -why- she did any of that? - Wed Nov 18 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: You realise, the game isn't inherently bad correct? - Wed Nov 18 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: .......... - Wed Nov 18 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) wasn't going to lie and say he was in the right, he was definately in the wrong. But the moment he saw Ortho's hand raise, his left hand was extended to the ground. And with a quick burst of chakra, he was propelled to the North. Aiming to avoid this snake based attack, he was able to sense the build up of chakra in the man's arms, so he had no reason to stay in this one place, he didn't wish to fight Ortho at this moment, but he figured it was inevitable at this point* - Wed Nov 18 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) raised his hands as he continued running at the enhanced speed as he came out of his momentary burst. Without turning back because that'd only serve to waste time, his hands were raised to chest level, aiming to make a single handseal, in which he'd vanish from his position, an attempt to leave the battle. He hadn't adequately prepared for, and not neccessarily one he desired to fight.  The goal was to accomplish this before he was bitten, had he succeeded, he'd make his way away from this settlement.* - Wed Nov 18 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) took a deep breath, he didn't neccessarily have to worry about the snakes biting him because he was wearing armor. And the moment the other snakes tried to bite into his flesh, his chakra suddenly flared, and lightning chakra was sent through his armor. Aiming to shock the snakes. And if they were in anyway connected with Ortho him by extension. He seemed terribly unammused, of couse if for whatever reason he wasn't able to accomplish such a task, he'd be ultimately caught.* - Wed Nov 18 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was seriously getting irritated,  and he took a deep breath. And his hands were slapped together, it was obvious Ortho had the ability to weave seals faster than him. So he'd have to stick to not using seals. When his hands collided with eachother, a large gale wind was shot towards Ortho, and subsequently the trees, were uprooted and blown backwards as a testament of this technique's power. He wasn't holding back anymore, Ortho bought him to this point. And he aimed to complete his technique during the time the male spent weaving his seals. At the same token, the male had prepared to don an advanced stance of his own. Preparing for any retaliation, should it come.* - Wed Nov 18 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) sighed as his hands were raised together at chest level, only making a single handseal as Ortho attempted to cage him in. And with a deep breath, a strong and wide torrent of water was released from his lips, it was powerful and furious aimed directly towards Ortho, aiming to hit him, and hard.  He couldn't afford to lose this fight, not now, so he had to give it his all. Even at the cost of Ortho's life, or his own. He'd be hated regardless of if he won or lost, so that wasn't a concern any longer. He already had a feeling of what to anticipate from the Earthern dome. So he prepared himself accordingly.* - Wed Nov 18 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was also not enjoying this little game they were playing and he was being taken lightly as well. The moment his scarlet eyes took notice of the build up of chakra, he released his current flow. Allowing the stream to settle between the two of them.  And he lept backwards, raising his hands to chest level, he aimed to make a single handseal and his chakra moved into the ground immediately spikes would begin to shoot up from around Ortho, aiming to impale him from all sides. If anything Ryutaro wasn't a fool.

------

Strategist extra turn:

His goal had been to make Ortho avoid by leaping upwards, in which case the chakra would've gathered in his left hand, before being shot towards Ortho's chest in the form of a fireball, aiming to knock him from the sky had he chosen to avoid the spikes in said manner, if that wasn't the case. He'd aim the fireball towards Ortho's leading leg in his attempt to dodge.* - Wed Nov 18 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) felt his mind beginning to zone out, "I'm going to lose." He thought to himself, but then....suddenly something back to happen..Black chakra began seeping from his body, black in nature, when his eyes blinked Naturally his pupils were now slitted with a single tomoe circling around the center tomoe.  He felt his heart skip a beat, as his K-9 Teeth sharpened considerably. And this would probably negate the effects of the Genjutsu casted upon him, but when Ortho's snakes shot forward. The male's hands became cloaked in a light blue chakra.

His palms shooting out, he aimed to grasp the snakes as they reached his side, with a startling show of strength. If he was able to grasp their body. His hands would squeeze down in a single motion aiming to completely crush their bodies, if not pop their heads off like toys, he didn't say anything but his eyes focused on the two of them before him. And a low growling could be seen. He was on the brink of conciousness at this point. 

But through some show of willpower, he retained some sense of 'intellegence'.* - Wed Nov 18 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was caught by the genjutsu.* - Wed Nov 18 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was probably easily stabbed in the chest by Ortho's snakes, after being hit by the air bullets. Which had more than enough potential to kill had he not been holding back. Ultimately he was probably dead be the combination of attacks there was no sorrow. There was only one regret, that he didn't say goodbye to the ones he cared about. But this was his death, he'd have to accept it and accept it. There was no comming back, He took comfort in knowing Sunagakure was still in the dark about what had occured to them.But hell, Ortho could pick up a hefty One Hundred Million Yen and possibly clear his own name.* - Wed Nov 18 04:57:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) gaze sifted up as the door was opened. He was definately expecting scientists to have entered the room, another injection...Another test. He felt his heart ache just at the thought, but he took notice of the woman who had entered the room. Within a fraction of a second he noticed her lack of clothes, causing his eyes to widen for a moment. They were almost hazel in color,  he didn't remain surprised for long. Within moments, the same dull gaze befell his eyes. As he studied the figure.

The male was wearing, a pure white shirt, with pure white pants. His blonde hair was nearly past shoulder length, and framed his face. His breathing was slow, but upon further inspection, his arms were fully extended to either side of himself, shackles were on his wrists, and the chains connected to either corner of the room. He didn't say anything for a long while, he considered the possibility his eyes were playing tricks on him.

"....." 

Nothing was said, he wondered if she was a prisoner---No an experiment similar to himself. His own eyes found hers, and examined the unique color, of her own followed by the color of her skin. He hadn't formed any opinions of what he saw, but he sat there on the cold ground. She may've even noticed, that on the walls. There were scratch marks,  dull as if done by fingertips, 'Help me', was written on the wall. 

And black splatters of some liquid could be seen around the room.* - Thu Nov 19 15:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) without moving his head his eyes followed her around, and still he said nothing. He took notice of the lack of sound comming from her body, he felt a stirring in his chest. But still it wasn't enough to concern him, he wondered why she was nude still. When she came to a stop before him, he scanned her front before looking back into her eyes. Something was off, he was still very much considering the possibility of his mind playing a trick upon him.

He remained silent, as she inhaled the black spot, It'd probably give off the same scent as blood if any at all, but upon tasting it was highly metallic, and almost 'oil'-like.  He looked towards the door, and closed his eyes briefly, he wondered what this figure had planned to do to him. It wasn't like he had the power nor strength to resist. 

She could probably tell that, they had been starving him to keep his energy at low levels.* - Thu Nov 19 15:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) the shackles which were around his wrists, had several coatings of the same stuff, showing struggle at one point. His wrists no doubt would carry the scars of said trials. But the blood seemed fairly old, as if he had been enduring this without attempts to flee lately. Maybe thinking of how to get out of this if he played the part. His clothes were almost perfectly clean, any drops of blood had formed small puddles of blood beneath his out-stretched arms.* - Thu Nov 19 15:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked back into her eyes as he heard her speak, and after a brief moment he replied "Are you?" He didn't know what a 'Human was', nor did he know if he was one, he was a product...Was he anything..? He wasn't sure, was he meant to be? He didn't know. He was here, and now, with no past and no future.* - Thu Nov 19 15:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched her expression through dull eyes, he had been used to getting hit. He acknowledged that brief change in attitude as one of agression and cruelty.  He didn't mind anymore. He watched as her appearance began to change, her body transforming into that of a mirror image of himself. His eyes widened once again but immediately reverted. He wondered how such a process might've occured, but once again he said nothing.* - Thu Nov 19 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ||Was probably some form of a Human, though it was hard to call him that after everything he'd been through, experiment after experiment. He was his own species, his own being, there was no one like him. Aside from his black blood, she'd probably notice how frail his body was as a result of the treatment and experiments. Though he did seem to have some physical capabilities, he seemed unnaturally light, and moved fast. * - Thu Nov 19 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: I've never seen a human.... with so little expression. - Thu Nov 19 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared at her as she spoke, and listened to her hushed tone. Before he closed his eyes:

"Human? That's what I am?" 

He didn't seem to like the name Human, --Or maybe it was to be categorized?* - Thu Nov 19 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) opened his eyes once again, his gaze traveled to his arms and to his bindings before back to Ume. "I don't wish to be categorized, Not as a Human...Not as anything. I am my own being, my own species...Alone." He paid particular attention to her 'tasting', he wondered if that was a habit of hers.* - Thu Nov 19 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) considered her words before he replied. "I do not understand their 'expressions', nor their emotions.  To me...they are pointless....So I suppose, you're right." He muttered his voice, was calm, and devoid of all emotions.* - Thu Nov 19 16:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Maybe. - Thu Nov 19 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What if I told you, I'm in this very place attempting to gain emotions from lacking them entirely. - Thu Nov 19 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That is suppose to be funny....right? - Thu Nov 19 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It is.. - Thu Nov 19 16:29:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's ironic. - Thu Nov 19 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes, yes -thats- the word. - Thu Nov 19 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Emotions are funny.... - Thu Nov 19 16:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ?* - Thu Nov 19 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) studied the motions, before focusing on her. "I won't say I understand....But there is a way....Possibly...There seems to be an inbalance, in the aritificial emotions. I grow...tired of being locked in here...There may be a way...to....correct that imbalance.....To...get payback on our...'captors'...."* - Thu Nov 19 16:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as she spoke "I am held here against my will, I believe I am a captive, This is the place...I was born at. They're my 'owners', my 'parents'...I was -created- here." He stated looking towards Ume.* - Thu Nov 19 16:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared at her "I may. That doesn't mean, I will accept them."* - Thu Nov 19 16:55:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I think you would make me feel slow. - Thu Nov 19 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked virtually indifferent by this revelation as he spoke "I don't know if that's a blessing or an insult, You thinking I'd make you sick." His eyes widened as her tongue connected with his cheek, but besides that, he seemed virtually unaffected. Definately not One hundred percent genuine human. "What do I taste like?"* - Thu Nov 19 17:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) listened to her words, as he closed his eyes inhaling followed by a exhale."We should get you...Answers." He paused listening to her words, as he nodded "That's one concern out of the way." He spoke, in a light tone. "Do you have a name?"* - Thu Nov 19 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It means plum. - Thu Nov 19 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded as he spoke "About the extent of what they've done to you, And what they planned to do."He stated, "Ume." Just to feel how it rolled off his tongue. "Could you help me...Get free?"* - Thu Nov 19 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) realised his hunger was making him jump to conclusions, he was probably losing brain cells. Once she looked at his cuffs, they were made with iron, and had an opening for a key on the wrists. He didn't say anything but remained still.* - Thu Nov 19 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her and nodded his head, he rested his arms and stood up. He was still shorter than her not by much, but in her current form she was taller than he was. "I see. I may be able to take care of the guards." It's been a while since he was free, so when he tried to stand he stumbled, coupled with his hunger and dehydration he was troubled. "Could you...Help me stand?"* - Thu Nov 19 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) noted she was definately right, as she helped him stand up. He took a deep breath, "Understood."  He stated, as his eyes widened for a moment, as her hand found his neck, he remained perfectly still. She may've noticed his skin was cold to the touch. But he said nothing, but put on an act of being in distress. Watching the door carefully.* - Thu Nov 19 17:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) || The Guards looked at Ume's Hostage and with their hands raised they spoke "Ume-san, please release the boy then we can talk." One of the guards slowly approached keeping his hands raised as he looked at her. "We can talk about him once the boy is released." He tried to mediate the situation probably not to much success.* - Thu Nov 19 17:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ||The guard sighed as he spoke "Lord Yosuke...Has....Been killed." He explained, he figured the least he could do was explain what had happened, though the guard seemed flustered talking to a naked woman. "By a man...known as Ortho?"* - Thu Nov 19 17:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) || One of the Guards ran towards Ume's side, while the other immediately took ahold of Thirteen's arms, and pinned him to the ground with relative ease. "Ume-sama...In Lord Yosuke's wake..He's left everything present to you...I know you're mourning....But..he trully cared for you..He's also left you most of his things in his will...We...are at your service."* - Thu Nov 19 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) || Looked at Ume "B-But Lady U--." He decided not to protest and released Thirteen while the other guard spoke "We were told that you wanted us to avoid you while you underwent your treatment...Was that false?" He asked genuinely surprised.* - Thu Nov 19 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ||Nodded his head as they had assumed it was the person who told them, since they hadn't seen him on the way down. "Y-Yes M'Lady."* - Thu Nov 19 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ||The Guard coughed a bit as he spoke "He...Was born here, by the scientists' extra curricular projects...He was being used as a Tester." The guard explained truthfully.* - Thu Nov 19 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Tester. - Thu Nov 19 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What does that mean? - Thu Nov 19 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ||Experimental drugs... - Thu Nov 19 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ||Modifications.. - Thu Nov 19 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ||Stuff the Scientists didn't want Yosuke knowing about.. - Thu Nov 19 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...... - Thu Nov 19 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yosuke wasn't aware he -existed-? - Thu Nov 19 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: :N-No Ma'am. - Thu Nov 19 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ......right. - Thu Nov 19 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head after standing up a bit wobbily again as he spoke "I don't have a name...I have a number.....Thirteen." He stated, looking towards Ume, wondering just who she was that they'd transfer ownership of this place to her.* - Thu Nov 19 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at Ume as she seemed to be standing up for him, he took a deep breath and nodded his head in thanks as the Guards answered her. "If he's weak, he can't control his abilities....He's a master of Illusions....If he's let out.....There'd be mass panic. The scientists fear him, so they wanted to keep him under wraps, and weak enough that they could perform tests." And the other guard answered. "A Hundred or so." The guards were aiming to be subtle in their stares, but it was anything but so.* - Thu Nov 19 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ||The Guard blinked, it seems his flustered-ness caused him to say something which was incorrect. "I-I'm sorry M'Lady! I spoke incorrectly...There was Four..Maybe Five tops...One of which you've...recently eaten."* - Thu Nov 19 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Right... - Thu Nov 19 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The other ones, how important are they? - Thu Nov 19 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Guard: Only one is of general...'importance'.. - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What is important about them? - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Guard: They head the Science Section, they're also one of the leading developers. - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Right right.... - Thu Nov 19 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Put him under lock and key from now on. - Thu Nov 19 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The others.... - Thu Nov 19 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ||The Guards blinked "Y-Yes M-Ma'am." They stated, a bit nervous in regards to her order, they weren't sure, but they would follow it. They were loyal guards afterall. The both of them ran out if permitted, and Thirteen' stomach growled. He probably wouldn't be able to do much fighting until he rested and ate something. And gained a few pounds.* - Thu Nov 19 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he looked towards Ume "Why...are you doing this for me?" He asked, his body definately hurt, but he felt relieved to finally be free from his shackles.* - Thu Nov 19 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her briefly, he was going to say he was sorry for her loss. But then he wondered how he could be sorry for something he had nothing to do with. "I see." Was all that was stated, as he took another step then stumbled a bit. "This is harder...than it looks."* - Thu Nov 19 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Do you mind....If I take my time with this? - Thu Nov 19 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn, I don't mind at all. - Thu Nov 19 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you want me to leave? - Thu Nov 19 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You can stay. - Thu Nov 19 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay, I would like to watch. - Thu Nov 19 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: This meal will be my thanks to you. - Thu Nov 19 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: This...-Feast-. - Thu Nov 19 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared down at the scientists he wasn't one for theatrics. But he was going to take his time, and draw out...Every...second of this madness...As the scientists were bought towards him. His hands met for a second...One of the techniques he had managed to learn....Surprisingly of his own accord, to torture these scientists. He wanted to have them fear...Be scared, just as he was. And when he made the handseal, in a -startling- show of skill.

In unison all the Scientists, were trapped in a single genjutsu, from around them they'd see their worst fears comming alive, torturing them, ripping them apart slowly...Piece by piece, while they were forced to stay awake, and feel the excruciating pain, his tongue ran over his lips. The Scientists, screamed out....And screamed. Their lungs threatened to give out on them.

He was -breaking- them, "Cry...Scream...Beg for Death...Know...Know how I felt." He stated, as one of them fell to the ground and began foaming in the mouth, he was laughing this was...Hysterical! He enjoyed every moment of it, some screamed until they couldn't scream anymore, tears streamed down their faces. And he...-watched-, he enjoyed every passing moment.

With his hand extended, he reached for one of his chains, the portion Ume had cut off. Before approaching one of the scientist, while he was invisible due to the effects of the genjutsu the boy extended the edge of the sliced chain, attempting to stab it repeatedly into the eye of one of the scientist.

"Does it hurt?"He paused.

"You aren't screaming loud enough~." He practically sang out.

After a while, maybe a few hours of torture, the scientists, were left in a pool of blood, and the boy ran his tongue across the chained link, licking up some of the blood.

"Your suffering...Was Delicious."* - Thu Nov 19 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled subtly as he stood---He actually smiled, he was relieved, like stress had been removed from his shoulders. As he nodded his head "Enjoy."* - Thu Nov 19 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: I don't think I've ever eaten that much before. - Thu Nov 19 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved to sit beside her, he was a bit 'surprised', by her method of devouring. But he wasn't exactly, startled by it either. As he sat, he sighed subtly, as his hand moved to rest on her forehead. "I trust...You've enjoyed your meal?"He stated, and if permitted, he'd begin stroking her hair as one might do a cat.* - Thu Nov 19 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) continued his actions as he spoke "They're scientists, and soldiers...They should be able to help me find my own flaws. I'm weak physically,  and if they can help me find them...The scientists can help fix them." He stated lightly, his eyes going over her form as she laid in the blood, it was definately a form of dark romanticism, that he found this moment to be particularly interesting. "I wish to...Become whole. I feel as if I'm missing parts of myself."* - Thu Nov 19 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh and swimming! - Thu Nov 19 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked as he spoke "That sounds wonderful. But I don't know anything about the outside...I suppose books would be perfect. But if you're going to put a glass wall in between, wouldn't it be easier to just share a room?" He asked, as he continued rubbing her hair slowly. "I've never been swimming before---Heck...I've never seen a body of water bigger than a glass."* - Thu Nov 19 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yeah...I wasn't always chained up like this. - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: They taught me to read and write. - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Are you not able to? - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh, what did you do that made them chain you up? - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: People always read to me. - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: One of them....The one who was my care taker... - Thu Nov 19 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: She angered me about Ten years ago...I don't even remember what happened. - Thu Nov 19 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But I used that technique on her. - Thu Nov 19 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And she curled into a ball on the floor and never uncurled. - Thu Nov 19 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Does that only work on people with emotions? - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Don't know. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You're the only person I know with no emotions. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Can you control it? - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Well...You have emotions. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: How does it kill them? - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And I can. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It didn't kill them. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No my emotions are not real. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Well... - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: The 'fear' can cause them to seize. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Or have heart attacks. - Thu Nov 19 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I would like to experience this some time. - Thu Nov 19 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You could die... - Thu Nov 19 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I cannot die. - Thu Nov 19 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: What? - Thu Nov 19 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can't die. - Thu Nov 19 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) had noticed her softness, but he had never actually met a Human or a female for that matter so he had nothing to compare it to. As he spoke "How is that possible?" He seemed more curious than surprised.* - Thu Nov 19 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The scientists said that I regenerate too fast to die. - Thu Nov 19 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Regenerate...To fast? - Thu Nov 19 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 19 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That's pretty interesting. - Thu Nov 19 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I guess. - Thu Nov 19 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You want to stay in the same room as me though? That is okay with you? I thought that wasn't normal. - Thu Nov 19 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yosuke stayed in my room but he loved me. - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Why wouldn't it be okay? - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And what's love? - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don--- - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It's an emotion. - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm...Really? - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Apparently the strongest one. - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It's when you would do anything for a person, even die for them. - Thu Nov 19 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Which... I'm worried is exactly what he did. - Thu Nov 19 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I believe pain is the strongest Emotion in that case. - Thu Nov 19 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Pain is not an emotion..... - Thu Nov 19 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It should be. - Thu Nov 19 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: N-no it shouldn't. - Thu Nov 19 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Something wrong..? - Thu Nov 19 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ..just something they did to me. - Thu Nov 19 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Want to talk about it? - Thu Nov 19 20:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then I won't ask. - Thu Nov 19 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You already did, silly. - Thu Nov 19 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ---I suppose I did. - Thu Nov 19 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I suppose you can stay in the room with me. - Thu Nov 19 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I will have them put stuff in there for you. - Thu Nov 19 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Stuff? - Thu Nov 19 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't sleep though, so don't get...weirded out. I can be silent when you sleep though. - Thu Nov 19 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes I will make them get you stuff. - Thu Nov 19 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I don't mind noise. - Thu Nov 19 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: A bed, clothing, books, anything else that male's your age get. - Thu Nov 19 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You tend not to be picky when you spend ten years chained up and fed liquids. - Thu Nov 19 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Males my age? - Thu Nov 19 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 19 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: We will get you lots of things to look at and choose from. - Thu Nov 19 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: When you don't like something we can take it away. - Thu Nov 19 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Thank you. - Thu Nov 19 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You don't need to ever thank me. - Thu Nov 19 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Would you like to go now? - Thu Nov 19 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh right. - Thu Nov 19 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Does my nudity bother you like it does the guards and scientists? - Thu Nov 19 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I haven't decided. - Thu Nov 19 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Alright. - Thu Nov 19 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And we can go. - Thu Nov 19 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) rubbed his wrists as the cuffs were removed, they revealed scars against his wrists.  He felt a lot better after being freed, looking towards the guards he said nothing. He wondered what the typical boy of his age would've liked. But he walked in behind her. "Is there a place to bathe?" He hadn't been washed in months, "And I suppose you don't mind my own nudity?" He asked finding it a bit tedious to walk around with clothes on because they shared the same room.* - Thu Nov 19 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he slowly began to undo his shirt, followed by his pants, it seemed they had not even bothered to give him underwear. So he was naked, his gaze shifted to the door which led to the bathroom. "If you'd like you could pull up a chair or something of the sort, I'd very much like to continue talking to you." He stated heading into the bathroom.* - Thu Nov 19 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was fairly decently hung, although nothing too special, on the back of his left shoulder it could be seen that he was branded. The Roman numeral thirteen was on his back. As he headed into the bathroom, he began to start the water for a bath, sitting on the edge for a moment before dipping a toe in. And eventually sliding in completely. "You weren't joking." He commented, with a slight grin. But he didn't say anything else. He looked towards her as he asked "What do you do that's exciting?"* - Thu Nov 19 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt her finger tips against his back which had made him jump slightly, but he took a deep breath continuing to move into the tub. "I see...We should change that, if you think of anything you'd like to do. Just let me know and we'll do it." He stated with a warm smile,  "I believe you're exciting even though we've just met, Unique at the very least."* - Thu Nov 19 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head as he spoke "I was just thinking, that doing what everyone else wants you to do would get boring fast for us." But slowly he reached for soap, and began lightly lathering up his body. As he spoke "When we were talking earlier, you don't have a scent do you?" He asked, beginning to lather up his arms.* - Thu Nov 19 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he then began washing under his arms, followed by his stomach. "What have you done with other people that they found interesting?" He asked out of curiosity,  As he began to lather up shampoo in his hair.* - Thu Nov 19 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded as he asked "What are pre-fertilization activities?" Having never heard the term before he was fairly interested.* - Thu Nov 19 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Humans call it sex. - Thu Nov 19 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: What is it like? - Thu Nov 19 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: To me, because I do not have a nervous system, it feels like a lot of pressure. - Thu Nov 19 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But humans enjoy it. - Thu Nov 19 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: They seem more relaxed afterwards. - Thu Nov 19 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll have to try it some time. - Thu Nov 19 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Maybe you will find someone to perform it with. - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm, Maybe. - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: What types of games have you played? - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Usually they have to do with the pre-fertilization. - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Sometimes question games. - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ...I see. - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Question games? - Thu Nov 19 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But you have been locked in a room for a long time. - Thu Nov 19 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So that wouldn't really do much. - Thu Nov 19 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You also don't seem like someone who gets nervous by being naked  so.... these games are pointless. - Thu Nov 19 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: We can probably make new games. - Thu Nov 19 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Any ideas? - Thu Nov 19 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) begins casually washing his pubic area, before dunking himself into the water, allowing all the suds to be removed from his body. As he resurfaced he gasped briefly. "Man this water feels great." He muttered, his hair now partially plastered to his face as he looked at her.* - Thu Nov 19 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You seem to like giving pain but I can't feel pain. - Thu Nov 19 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: We will think of something that you enjoy. - Thu Nov 19 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Sounds good. - Thu Nov 19 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Could I ask you a favor though? - Thu Nov 19 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 19 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Teach me, about your body. About you, and about the world/ - Thu Nov 19 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ?* - Thu Nov 19 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: About me and my body? - Thu Nov 19 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yes.. - Thu Nov 19 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Your body differs from my own. - Thu Nov 19 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That's because I appear female. - Thu Nov 19 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't really know much about my body. - Thu Nov 19 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Thu Nov 19 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I just know that they like touching me. - Thu Nov 19 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: ..Interesting. - Thu Nov 19 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But we shouldn't focus on that. - Thu Nov 19 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: So what do you do, besides talk to plants when alone? - Thu Nov 19 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...just think. - Thu Nov 19 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You used a Ninjutsu to break my chains earlier...Are you a shinobi? - Thu Nov 19 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No, shinobi's like teaching me. - Thu Nov 19 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: How do you know what ninjutsu is? - Thu Nov 19 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Books. - Thu Nov 19 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Is that how you learned how to use genjutsu? - Thu Nov 19 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yes and no. - Thu Nov 19 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stood from the water after washing himself off not bothering to dry himself, "Maybe the food has arrived?"* - Thu Nov 19 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smelled the aroma as it touched his nostrils, he looked at her gaze and for a moment felt slightly embarrassed. As he swallowed hard, before heading to sit down in front of one of the trays not caring about drying off nor getting dressed. He'd open it up and begin digging in.* - Thu Nov 19 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was stuffing his face, as he stopped noticing her turning her head "You know you don't have to mind your manners with me. Com'ere." He stated, tapping the floor beside him. Assuming that he himself was sitting on the floor. "So when you transformed into me earlier, does that hurt?"* - Thu Nov 19 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) didn't mean to tell her to sit on the floor, as he simply motioned for her hand if she'd allow him. He'd pull her up onto his knee as he spoke "Really? Nothing at all?" He was definately curious about this ability of hers.  "How does it work?"* - Thu Nov 19 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt her sex against him, as he thought about what she said. "Is there limitations to your replication ability?" He asked taking a bite out of another piece of food before setting it down.* - Thu Nov 19 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Not that I'm aware of. - Thu Nov 19 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Thu Nov 19 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If you don't eat food, does your body need supplements along with the bodies? - Thu Nov 19 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No. - Thu Nov 19 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't -need- the bodies. I crave them. - Thu Nov 19 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm...Almost like a treat? Or dessert? - Thu Nov 19 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 19 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Do you think you can help me train? - Thu Nov 19 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes probably. - Thu Nov 19 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Tell me about your past? - Thu Nov 19 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What about it? - Thu Nov 19 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I was born two years ago. - Thu Nov 19 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Well... 'born'. - Thu Nov 19 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I was made. - Thu Nov 19 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Like I was...? - Thu Nov 19 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn..no. - Thu Nov 19 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I think you started out human. - Thu Nov 19 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You were born. - Thu Nov 19 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know how they made me. - Thu Nov 19 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And I never was little like humans start. - Thu Nov 19 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You were created to this size? - Thu Nov 19 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) wakes up on the bed, and looks up towards the ceiling, he flexed his fingers some before curling them together. It was an odd sensation to be freed, he sat up at some point he had the decency to put on underwear, which were black with red highlights. And smiley faces scattered upon them, standing from the bed he'd stretch his legs, seemingly more accustomed to walking.* - Fri Nov 20 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) approached Ume from behind before taking a seat beside her on the ground, a hand rested on her shoulder as he asked "Are they saying anything interesting?" His gaze settled on her, he seemed a lot more well rested than before but he was still pretty pale in comparison to most, but not anywhere as pale as she was.* - Fri Nov 20 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) sat beside her as he spoke "Your posture, and your gaze...They tell a lot more than you care to think.  I wouldn't have put it past you." He stated, deciding to lay down on the ground beside her. "So anything interesting?"* - Fri Nov 20 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Just how they feel right now. - Fri Nov 20 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: They don't like being in here...but I try to make them as happy as I can. - Fri Nov 20 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You run this place, you could take them outside couldn't you? - Fri Nov 20 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes but I brought them in here to keep me company. - Fri Nov 20 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That's true. - Fri Nov 20 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Well what are you in the mood for today? - Fri Nov 20 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I thought I would let you decide, and we could give the experiments a rest for the day...so you can recover. - Fri Nov 20 20:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'd appreciate that. - Fri Nov 20 20:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You said yesterday we could make our own game. - Fri Nov 20 20:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Any ideas? - Fri Nov 20 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I am not very good at ideas. - Fri Nov 20 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm.. - Fri Nov 20 20:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Why not go swimming or something of the sorts? - Fri Nov 20 20:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn...no, no swimming today. - Fri Nov 20 20:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm... - Fri Nov 20 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: What would other people have been asking you to do? - Fri Nov 20 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ..I don't know. - Fri Nov 20 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Why are you concerned about other people? - Fri Nov 20 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That's a good question. - Fri Nov 20 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I don't know why I'm concerned with them. - Fri Nov 20 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Would you like to plant a Garden at some point? - Fri Nov 20 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: That would be nice. - Fri Nov 20 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved to sit behind her, and once he had he'd move until his legs were at the sides of her own. And he'd lean forward to rest his chin on her shoulder, as he asked "But before that...There's some stuff that I've been meaning to ask, Like.... Before you came here what did you do? Travel?"* - Fri Nov 20 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) his hands found her waist before wrapping around her lightly as he heard her speak "Teach you? Teach you what?" He asked curiously, if he recalled correctly he had seen her use Earthern element Ninjutsu. He definately found this interesting, since he himself had a thirst for knowledge. But he hadn't met many people in his life, so he couldn't understand why people would be so eager to give.* - Fri Nov 20 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved in a bit closer until he was pressed against her, as he closed his eyes he spoke "How to fight? And Ninjutsu?" He paused for a bit before he spoke "I wouldn't mind reading to you some time, or even teaching you to write yourself some time." He stated lightly, with his chest against her back and his hands resting just below her belly button he was really able to feel how soft she was and it was interesting. He enjoyed the feeling, he was wondering what kind of techniques she might've learned and he made it his goal to ask about that next.* - Fri Nov 20 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) hadn't honestly realised what it was he was doing. "I'll read to you whenever you like, and the same for teaching you...Do you have any types of stories you enjoy hearing?" He asked, both of his hands now resting on either of her hips respectively.* - Fri Nov 20 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head as he spoke "I see, well...Maybe I could tell you one right now?" He suggested. If she was looking at his hands, she'd probably notice the scarring around his wrists, signaling his attempts to break out from his bindings, but besides that his hands were blemish free, the skin was smooth, probably because he never had to 'work', like most men had. His hands gently moved up and down her hips, following the curve which was created due to her sitting position before returning back to their original posision.* - Fri Nov 20 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt his mind zoning in on the feeling of her soft flesh against the tips of his fingers, not only that he felt his heart rate beginning to speed. "My heart...?" He was confused by this greatly. But he opened his mouth as he spoke "Once upon a time, there was a girl from a land far...far away...She desired to be a Shinobi...But she lacked the ability to use her chakra...She was apart of the eighty percent of the world which lacked the ability." He took a deep breath, and he felt the heat in his body rising. "Am I sick?"

He wondered to himself but didn't touch on it more. "She was denied from the Academy multiple times, her Mother didn't believe she could do it, nor did her siblings or friends." He paused, as his hands slowly began drifting inwards, towards her thighs.* - Fri Nov 20 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) his hands rested on her thighs for a moment, as he continued the story. "Out of all the people...Who didn't believe in her...Her father stood by her side. He motivated her, and did what he could to help her get stronger despite being part of the large majority. So she trained, and trained, and vowed to become a Shinobi even if she couldn't use chakra she'd master the art of hand to hand combat." His left hand inched closer a bit more, gently moving against her soft thigh, as he stopped once again. "What is...this feeling?" It truly baffled him it was foreign, to him. He swallowed hard. "She took time, years...To train with her style. And she gradually made improvement, but even so...Someone who couldn't use chakra was unprecendented."* - Fri Nov 20 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: OP - Fri Nov 20 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) for a smart guy, was pretty stupid when it came to this. This time his right hand moved, aiming to move between her legs, though not touching her sex it'd aim to rest on her inner thigh.  He couldn't understand his feelings, nor why he felt the 'urge', and desire to touch her.  "She returned to the Academy..She was far older than her class at this point, the instructor laughed when she stated she couldn't use chakra. But even so she didn't let it get to her, and she took the test. She of course failed the aptitiude tests for both Ninjutsu and genjutsu..But when the judges were about to deny her entry form..She demonstrated her Taijutsu prowess." He stated, he began feeling a tightness in his gut which traveled down his body.* - Fri Nov 20 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) his right hand aimed to move the final stretch, causing his fingers to brush up against her sex. Resting there, he wasn't sure what he was going to do since he was there. But it did cause his heart to race a bit harder, as his breathing became heavier he spoke "Her...movements, were gracefull, beautiful and elegant. They were skilled, with fluid motions...The Proctors...They were speechless. Never before had they seen such a style before. Once she was done, there was a moment of silence, the only sound that could be heard was her breathing which was akin to pants, due to heightened activity. Not a sound was made, and the judges stared. An eerie silence swept the place." He felt a strange stirring inside his boxers, but nothing came of it yet. The fact he didn't know what was going on startled him greatly, but he aimed to stay strong for the sake of the story.* - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) held his hand there, before his palm rested flat against her sex. The stirring in his groin, had begun to manifest itself, and a small bulge had sprouted in his underwear, and subsequently against her due to how he was sitting. He found her gaze as he spoke "Like it? They were in love with it, they had never seen something like it before. Later that year she graduated the Academy, and within two years she was a Chunnin in rank. Every day she trained, twice as hard as everyone else...A way to repay her father for believing in her. She grew up to become a great Ninja, one of the best in her class...She lit the way for many more like her." For  whatever reason, he found himself enjoying this closeness, and touching her. It made him 'happy', but it was so unexplainable. "Why does...it feel so weird down there?" He wondered to himself in regards to his own body.* - Fri Nov 20 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head "D-Did you like it?" He paused unsure of his own voice "Did my voice just crack?" That was definately highly embarrassing for him, along with the fact that it caused a stutter in his voice. His fingers, moved along the outside of her sex, exploring her flower which was uncharted terrirtory for the boy.* - Fri Nov 20 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her briefly as he raised his hands as he spoke "Could you face me Ume?" He asked, he desired to get a closer look at what it was that was drawing his attention almost instinctually. As he scratched his cheek, he felt a large collaboration of emotions and slowly he was beginning to understand what they were but he couldn't quite place them.* - Fri Nov 20 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her nude form and he felt the hardness in his boxers, the feeling of being confined and denied freedom growing more by the second. He desired to touch her, and by extension to be touched. As his eyes gazed over her breats and nipples, her stomach. Down to her sex, to her legs, and to her feet before shifting back to her sex. This was the first time, he had any appreciation for the female form, almost like he was hypnotized, his hands found her legs which were at his side, and gently caressed over them. As his heart raced even further, his hazel eyes looked into hers. For the briefest of moments.* - Fri Nov 20 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) he almost jumped when she spoke, it took him out of his own world, as his hands raised from her legs. "I'm...not sure....I feel...'weird'..." He stated lightly, as he continued to steal non-subtle glances at her body.* - Fri Nov 20 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I didn't mean to scare you. - Fri Nov 20 22:50:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I want to...touch you....And to have you touch me....Is that...weird? - Fri Nov 20 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Im confused how you can already come to this conclusion when you have never seen a female body and were locked away in that room. - Fri Nov 20 22:53:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Instinct maybe...? - Fri Nov 20 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You can touch me. - Fri Nov 20 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You already were. - Fri Nov 20 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can't feel anything though. - Fri Nov 20 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So you can't hurt me or make me feel positive like you feel. - Fri Nov 20 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Can't feel....anything? - Fri Nov 20 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: No, I don't have a nervous system. - Fri Nov 20 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I feel pressure, that's it. - Fri Nov 20 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stood and without hesitation, there was almost a crazed look in his eyes. Being locked in a cage for Ten years while going through puberty would do that to you. Moving forward, his hands aimed to find her shoulders, in which case he'd aim to push her down to the ground. His breathing was heavier at this point his heart racing, had he managed to push her to the ground. One of his legs would be between her own with his knee pressed against her sex, while one of her own was between his . He'd stare down at her as he spoke "Ume....Why do I feel like this?" He asked, staring her deep into her own eyes.* - Fri Nov 20 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) while his left hand remained on her shoulder, his right hand moved to her face, resting against her cheek. Before it slid down to her neck, resting against the side of her neck with his thumb across her neck, his hand was gentle not applying a lot of pressure beyond what was natural. Before it moved down, to her chest, aiming to run his hand across her breast, feeling it's texture before over her nipple. Wondering how it'd feel, as he did so. He leaned forward, resting his forehead against hers, as he stared into her eyes. Close enough that their lips were able to brush against eachothers as they spoke:

"Human....I'm not Human. I....Dislike that word....I don't want to be categorized as human...Not now...Not -ever-." As he said this the pressure on her left shoulder would increase ever so slightly as a testament to his dislike of the word.* - Fri Nov 20 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt a stirring in his chest, the feeling of 'control', it made him happy....Why? He wasn't sure. His hand found her side, before down to her hip. As he leaned inwards, his head moving to the area which connected her neck to her shoulder, and with his tongue extended, he ran his tongue across her soft flesh in the same manner she had licked his cheek. Slow, taking his time to sample her. Exploring uncharted territory, excited him greatly...Maybe it was that his thirst for knowledge was being sated?  He wasn't sure, but this influx of feelings...he enjoyed them all greatly. * - Fri Nov 20 23:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) normally the lack of taste would've gotten to him, surprised him even, but now. He was far to deep in the moment,and when she turned her head away. He bit down lightly, not to break the skin, as his right hand moved to reach beneath her, resting on her butt, before sliding down her unnaturally soft flesh to find the back of her knee, he'd raise her leg up to his side. Transitioning from the bite, to a kiss,  the edge of his lips curled into a wicked smile. He felt his arousal mounting rising by the second. His other hand moved to her right breast, and began roughly groping her flesh, the feeling against his fingertips sending chills through his body.* - Fri Nov 20 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved the leg he was supporting onto his back, almost as if he intended for her to wrap it around his upper body. He moved down some, until he was at the same level as her breasts. He ran his tongue across the soft flesh, before he leaned to take her nipple into his mouth, he was doing what felt natural...What he sucked on the nub. First it started off subtle, but gradually increased in intensity. He was hard at this moment, his erection rubbing at the inside of her left leg through his boxers.* - Fri Nov 20 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) he heard her words, and stopped sucking for a moment to nod his head to her. And when he returned to sucking on her nipple, he bit down as if getting  'payback' for her interrupting him. Though he knew she couldn't feel pain there was no intent on trying to harm her. He stopped his actions momentarily. And planted a subtle kiss upon her nipple. Before planting another one on the center of her chest. Sliding down once again, his tongue, was ran from the center of her chest, down to just over her belly button. His right hand moved between her legs, and over her sex, touching it with only his finger tips. 

"Ume...I want you to help me."* - Fri Nov 20 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) as he drifted lower, both hands found the back of the knee of either leg. And lifted them so that her legs could rest on his back. Comming face to face with her flower, he got his first...Up close look at her down there, he was a tad irritated by her refusal but that quickly was washed away. He knew she couldn't feel his breath against, her but bringing his left hand forward his index finger traced around her sex.circling the outside. Before he ran his tongue across her slit, sampling it. He didn't expect a taste, but afterwards. His lips met her inner thigh and planted another kiss on it. He didn't know what to do especially at this point, it was definately foreign territory...He had -never- seen a vagina up close,  hell even in books. But he figured this was as good a time as any to learn.* - Sat Nov 21 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved one hand and rested atop of her mound, his tongue moved forward against her inner lips. Though he definately seemed baffled at this point, taking a lot longer to decide what it was he intended to do this time around. He wouldn't mind some instruction, he was eager to learn. And he was finding out there was only so far he could advance and learn from himself.* - Sat Nov 21 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you like licking me? - Sat Nov 21 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I figured it was something only for human females since no one else tried this. - Sat Nov 21 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I.... - Sat Nov 21 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Think so. - Sat Nov 21 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked as he nodded his head, and slowly his thumbs found the band of his underwear, and pulled down,. Sliding them down his legs, and off of him, exposing himself to her, in all of his glory. He had of course aimed to sit up for this task, and once he had finished he sat upon his legs looking at her he wondered why she had him take off his shorts. Then it occured to him, that he hadn't handled himself...Hell he didn't even know he could.* - Sat Nov 21 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated her silence for a bit, before he got an idea, and slowly his gaze shifted towards her left hand. As he moved to slowly take it in his own, before lowering it onto his hardened member had she permitted him in doing this, he'd aim to make her take ahold of him in her hand. Had he managed to establish some sort of contact, he'd aim to lightly rock his hips, rubbing his member against her hand. He was definately experimenting, the entire process seemed weird to him, but once he got her hand there, he'd gasp. Being the first time he'd been touched it'd send pleasurable chills through his body.* - Sat Nov 21 00:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) gasped, as his eyes closed as the pleasure rocked his body feeling the softness of her hand surrounding his member. He was forced to stop for a moment, as his heart raced, after a few seconds. He resumed his rocking of his hips, moving his member against her palm. Before he stopped for a moment, looking at her he had gotten a wicked idea. "U-Ume....S-Sit up." He spoke, releasing a light moan as he spoke.* - Sat Nov 21 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took a deep breath, as he slowly pulled his member from between her fingers. Holding it in front of her face as he simply stated "Open." Referring to her mouth, he was wondering how it would feel. And he swallowed hard, he was introduced to an entirely new system thanks to her. And he smiled subtly, as he waited for her to open her mouth, if she planned to at all.* - Sat Nov 21 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ....you want me to eat you? - Sat Nov 21 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: No.... - Sat Nov 21 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I want you to try....sucking like I did your breasts.. - Sat Nov 21 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked as he felt her mouth surround his member, and the tight suction her lips made around his length. He felt his entirety taken in with a single motion, that caused him to release a slight moan, as he spoke "W-Wow." Genuinely surprised, but once again his lips curled into a smile as he spoke "N-Now....move...y-your head back and forth....and use your tongue to lick it...?" He had gotten the idea from when he 'stroked' his member with her hand, he was definately 'learning' something new.And diving into a new sort of excitement he hadn't known existed.* - Sat Nov 21 01:00:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) woke up subtly rubbing his eyes as he looked to Ume he stretched before moving into a sitting position on the floor. "Morning."* - Sat Nov 21 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) wanders over to her bad, laying over beside he he hadn't bothered with clothes. As he spoke "Good Morning Ume, not talking to the plants this morning?" He asked, laying on his back as he stared up towards the ceiling maybe he was missing something.* - Sat Nov 21 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes briefly as he nodded his head before he spoke "I see, But in this world anything is possible." He muttered as he moved to rest his head on her, mostly because she was softer than the pillows.* - Sat Nov 21 12:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes normally he would've had some form of anger, but the side of his mouth curled upwards into a smile. "I suppose our situation is one filled with Irony." He thought he probably was an 'ironic existence', but even so. He was well rested so he was in a good mood, not like he could harm anyone while being in a bad mood. As he rested his head on her breast, he turned his head towards her and stared at her face for a long while. "Ume, I was thinking could we leave this room? Even if we start some experiments up again. Even go outside eventually."* - Sat Nov 21 12:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked towards her as he spoke "Going outside.....now? I've never been outside of that room." He explained, it was a bit unsettling as he considered the idea "I won't run, and I suppose in a way you do own me, But I enjoy speaking with you...You interest me as well." He stated with a gentle smile.* - Sat Nov 21 12:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, much like Ume he would've said thank you if he thought it'd mean anything to her but he spoke "You mentioned experiments last night, which did you have in mind..?" He asked, --he did shake his head when she spoke about exploring rooms, but he agreed that it may end badly.* - Sat Nov 21 12:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, as he spoke "I see, I'll sit here as they try then...I'll make sure you stay safe Ume." He didn't understand the concept of friends, but he didn't say anything, as he rested against her he had no clue what type of experiments they had prepared. But he wanted to be stronger, was this the way to do it? He wasn't sure.* - Sat Nov 21 12:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated this thought . "I'm not sure what it is I want, not yet...Maybe it's safer that I wait in that case." He stated, before transitioning from the laying position he was in. Until he was laying on his side against her, with his bare member pressed against her thigh. His left arm moved to rest over her stomach and his head against the side of her breast. "It's all been so confusing, it's hard to get into the flow of things when I've been locked in a room for so long."* - Sat Nov 21 12:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated her words "Free?" He said beneath his breath, as he closed his eyes for a moment before she asked about his name, "It isn't a desire of mines...Not now, but once I leave here...I'll probably need one....So...could you name me...? Ume."* - Sat Nov 21 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) opened a single eye, as his gaze settled on her, before to her arm that had wrapped around him. After a few moments "What's wrong Ume?" He asked, as his gaze settled on her. Curious as to why she had stopped, "Chi?" He thought to himself. He felt like he shouldn't have asked what was wrong, that was a question held in the middle of a mine-field.* - Sat Nov 21 13:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) could easily sense that this was beginning to be a touchy subject for her so he wouldn't pry any further. Though the arm that wrapped around her stomach, moved around her hip, pulling her into him a bit more for a 'comforting' hug. He also didn't say anything else.* - Sat Nov 21 13:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at the plants as he stared at them, "They're interesting, but certainly not the most interesting thing in the room." He stated, looking up to her, he didn't seem to mind this closeness. Interaction was great for him at this moment, and made him feel...not bored. His cheek rubbed against her breast briefly. Before closing his eyes.* - Sat Nov 21 13:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: No u misunderstand, the sink is the most interesting thing. Running water like wdf. - Sat Nov 21 13:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled subtly as he spoke "That makes you even more interesting." He stated, he wondered what the rest of the world was like, he'd make it his bussiness to ask about it some time---But why not now? "What is the world like?"* - Sat Nov 21 13:28:32 2015
