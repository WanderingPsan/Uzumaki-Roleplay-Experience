<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head, before bowing respectfully to Zenaki. "I'd be honored." He stated lightly. Before standing upright.* - Sat Oct 17 14:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head "Yeah, Definately." He wondered if they'd retain the properties of the thing that was used to create it, But he figured he'd find out soon enough, this was definately a great technique to have at his disposal. He carefully observed Zenaki's form, before he took a seat on the ground before her.* - Sat Oct 17 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked a bit surprised as she grabs his hand, watching as she placed it atop of her lap, he held a faint blush.  But he slowly listened to her description definately interested in such a technique as she put it to use, he felt the sand laying upon his arm, before she began inserting chakra into it, causing the cells to stick together as she rubbed the sand over his arm, he was definately surprised that the sand actually formed a a bandage which hadn't broken apart when he moved his arm.

"Wow...This technique is amazing."

The possibilities were endless, and because of the technique he'd be able to probably save his own life, not to mention others, and that was great, he ran a hand over the bandage, and smiled warmly. * - Sat Oct 17 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would slowly nod his head as he reached for the scroll and slowly he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, looking at her arm as it was rested on his lap, not doing much to help his own embarrassment. His gaze shifted off to the side out of embrarrassment. As he nodded his head slowly he placed his hands off to the side, gathering a bit of sand in his hands, before he slowly moved to place the sand upon Zenaki's arm. Inhaling followed by a deep exhale.

He began gently rubbing the sand across her forearm, channeling his chakra into the sand as it began to compact, and transition into that of bandages, he smiled lightly, as this technique seemed fairly simple to execute, once he was done, he offered the scroll back to her, allowing her to admire his handiwork, the bandages although they weren't the best, they had been formed and he was happy.* - Sat Oct 17 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Keep trying.  - Sat Oct 17 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You are going to master this, today. - Sat Oct 17 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Or atleast not as floppy and sloppy as they are now. - Sat Oct 17 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head, though occasionally he stole glances towards Zenaki, it was probably because he developed a small infatuation when it came to her, or maybe general embarrassment, but either way as she held her arm on his lap, he slowly brushed away the first bit of sand, before he took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a deep exhale. His breathing was controled and light. So he  continued training this technique.

Using his hands he scooped up some more sand and slowly laid it upon her arm, his hands began gently rubbing the sand over her limb, before he inhaled followed by an exhale as he began to gently push his chakra into the sand attempting to form bandages,  he took a deep breath and once the bandages formed. 

He carefully knocked them away, before attempting the jutsu once again, he didn't have anywhere to be or anyone to see so as he attempted this his total focus was on the technique and Zenaki's arm, he zoned out all outside sounds and simply focused on the task at hand, and a long task it would prove to be, he wondered if he was making progress.

But as he continued he didn't seem to be getting tired, his chakra seemed to be at a large level, suggesting he didn't get tired from repeating the same technique repeatedly, though getting bored was an entirely different thing, Zenaki was his teacher in this moment, and she said he was going to master this today, so master it he would.

He took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a deep exhale, this technique definately was repetitive so he just continued doing what it was he was doing, he nodded a gradual increase in his abilities, and as such he continued doing it, he was noticing it was becomming easier to perform.

As chakra continued to be gathered and moulded into the appropriate levels, he raised a single hand from her arm and slowly scratched his cheek, he wondered why she was helping him, she could've easily denied him, but he didn't wish to think to much into it,  either way, he realised his technique was progressing, but as he practiced it his mind also focused on others.

He was good at multi-tasking, and part of him wondered if he used hiding like a mole if he would be able to use this technique under the ground to create bandages, he figured it'd be good if he was injured and needed to patch himself up mid-fight, so he continued rubbing the sand along her arm. Casting the technique before nknocking it aside.

His training was moving along just fine, and he was probably going to be here for a while longer, but he didn't mind there wasn't much else he could or would've been doing if he wasn't here, and he was thankful for her help, he didn't have as much patience as he let on so when he was about only a hour into it signs of boredom surfaced.

But he continued on, and as he put his mind to it, his technique began to show improvement a lot of it at that, he figured he was close to mastering it if not already there, after a while, he decided it was time to call it quits, he had assumed he had made a lot of progress with it, and nodded his head. "I think this has been productive." He commented with a warm smile.* - Sat Oct 17 14:49:10 2015
