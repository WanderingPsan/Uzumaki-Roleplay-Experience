<br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) if able, his hands would find her back, one on her upper back, and one or her lower back. With gentle circular motions, he closed his eyes. Enjoying the sensation of Katsune nuzzling against him. And it definately was a unique sensation, he could sit here for hours.* - Sat Oct 31 17:50:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked at this sudden revelation, feeling Kat's teeth bite down against him through his shirt. He winced in pain, especially as she tugged at his skin, pulling it to and fro, as she sucked on it. It definately hurt, not unimagineably so, but it did alarm him. He watched as she crawled further up his body, before her butt found his stomach. He swallowed hard, looking up to her, he felt the throbbing sensation of where she bit It hurt, but he'd live.

He felt both of her palms resting on his chest, and he looked up to her studying her expression,  every bone in his body told him to resist or run. He felt her hand moving through his hair, which was almost too soft, his heart was racing. He acknowledged this fact all to well. She could kill him, he looked at her arm as her palm rested on his head. After a moment it returned to her.

"Why?" 

Was all he asked, it was calm, but one of those tense calms. He felt like the answer was in plain sight."Because she could." That's what he felt, he focused on her. He didn't have to say anything, he knew she'd tell him.* - Sat Oct 31 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) wasn't by any means calm, he was scared, it was just that he accepted the inevitablity of the situation. He felt her hand move from his head, and her other hand move from his chest. And he listened to her words, he looked up to her, and didn't say anything. His eyes focused on her, "Prey." He repeated. He was her prey.

After a moment of collecting his thoughts he spoke:

"If you're waiting for me to slip up, I'm sorry to tell you. You're going to be waiting for a while longer. 

As he spoke this he looked directly into her eyes, he was fine with being the prey, but eventually. The hunted would become the hunter, and that's when this game would become truly fun.* - Sat Oct 31 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) bit his bottom lip as she planted her butt firmly upon his crotch.  His heart was still racing, growing faster with each comming moment.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) suddenly his hands would find her hips, before with a single motion he'd aiam to switch their positions with her being on the bottom and him on top. As he spoke:

"It's easy when it's you, not to think about other girls." He stated lightly. Had he managed to swap positions with her in the fist place his hands would find themselves about half-way up her side.* - Sat Oct 31 18:25:55 2015

As he spoke "I'm pretty envious of you Kat, I've always admired your ability to think things through...Come up with efficient plans. It is always amazing to see you do it." He stated, as he looked down to her.

"I'm always thinking of what I can do, to make up for my lack of strength. But I always end up putting you in bad situations."

He paused for a moment, and for a moment he looked extremely dissapointed in himself before he smiled as he spoke "But is it wrong? I enjoy those situations? The ones that are caused by my stupidity, because I get to sit here and come up with a solution with you." * - Sat Oct 31 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) leans forward, as he attempted to kiss her on her shoulder. As he simply stated "I guess we make a good duo, Eh? I line em' up, you knock em' down."

It's just that the targets, seem to do stuff I didn't account for.." He paused.

"Like move."* - Sat Oct 31 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as se looked away, and as a response his next kiss was planted lightly on her neck.  As he looked back at her, "I was wondering, if one of these days. We could go on another date---Maybe not as clear cut as go and sit down eat, and head home. But maybe something fun." He stated lightly.* - Sat Oct 31 18:48:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her legs' embrace around him tighten as he was rolled over onto his back.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see... - Sun Nov  1 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's good. - Sun Nov  1 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wouldn't be a fair game otherwise. - Sun Nov  1 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I like to play fair. - Sun Nov  1 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It only feels good when I win, if I play fair. - Sun Nov  1 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) laughed a bit as he nodded his head, appreciating her straight-forwardness, before he decided to answer her question as he spoke:

"I was considering sparing...But I'm not much of a challenge for you. So I was thinking we could teach eachother a thing or two, Like that lightning chakra flow."* - Sun Nov  1 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lightning chakra flow sounds good. - Sun Nov  1 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure what I can teach you but.... - Sun Nov  1 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm sure we'll think of something. - Sun Nov  1 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: We have time. - Sun Nov  1 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Well come closer. - Sun Nov  1 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm not sure if learning from that distance is efficient. - Sun Nov  1 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. Right. - Sun Nov  1 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) appreciated the gesture and released a sigh of relief, as he slowly reached for a coin which he had in his pocket...It was money, It wasn't far fetched. He held the coin up for her to see as he spoke "It's quite simple, when you think of electricity you probably think of getting shocked---Or rather shocking others. I'd concentrate, on that sensation. The feeling of being shocked. And aim to transfer said feeling onto the coin." 

He demonstrated as his chakra surged around the coin which began to develop sparks of electricity which danced around the coin, he looked at her as he stated:

"If you don't balance your chakra correctly, You can inflict self-harm. So try to keep it in close proximity to your weapon, Lightning Chakra not only increases the cutting power -but-, if you use a bladed weapon it'll induce a numbing like effect to the area that was hit. Which could render an enemy immobile." 

He went on and got into detail about applications and how to perform the technique.* - Sun Nov  1 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: lmao - Sun Nov  1 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) offers it to her as he nodded his head, resting it upon her open palm.* - Sun Nov  1 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiled a bit as he had taken a seat as he watched her attempt the technique which he realised was stupid since she had effectively learned the technique in a relatively short period of time. He whistled as he spoke "Impressive." He stated, standing as he approached her admiring her handiwork. As he nodded his head. She definately was impressive.* - Sun Nov  1 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd say that I can't wait to use this armor in a fight but.... - Sun Nov  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ya know what? - Sun Nov  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think I can. - Sun Nov  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For some reason.... - Sun Nov  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This armor makes me feel really calm. - Sun Nov  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) reached for the coin, as he spoke "That's good." He stated, happy she was enjoying his gift as he sighed. It was a happy sigh though.* - Sun Nov  1 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Enemies.... - Sun Nov  1 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Marrissa....Ortho.... - Sun Nov  1 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Even possibly Hassan.... - Sun Nov  1 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt comfort in the fact, she felt safe or at least that she gave off the feeling of being safe. Honestly her words shocked him. But definately he was happy, as he looked into her eyes, he smiled warmly.  "That's great, Kat."* - Sun Nov  1 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: done - Sun Nov  1 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sighed in relief, as he took a deep breath as she sat, before slowly he sat beside her, laying down as he spoke:

"I've been waiting for those words for a while."* - Sun Nov  1 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked over at Kat, as she laid on the ground. He was smiling, happy to see her relaxing---But that shakey breath she took. It was odd, but it was even worse when he saw the tears forming in her eyes, before seeing Kat outright...Cry. He felt his heart tremble...It wasn't out of pain, or sadness, it was unexplainable. But it didn't hurt, he was speechless.

And he listened to her words, he couldn't help the sensation which washed over him, it was...Peaceful almost. He felt like he finally...Did something right.* - Sun Nov  1 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was happy...She didn't hide this moment from him, as he slowly leaned forward. He'd aim to wrap his arms around Katsune, and hug her. He felt the need to, not that it was neccessary, he was just happy. That they've finally arrived at this point/* - Sun Nov  1 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) just held onto her, in a warm but gentle embrace. He was enjoying this moment, of 'Catharsis', this was truly a good cry he felt Katsune needed. She was relaxed, he hoped that this would also make her happy.* - Sun Nov  1 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) leans in as he spoke "As much...As I love hugging you....With the sand in my underwear....It's really uncomfortable." He stated, his legs rubbing together  as a look of discomfort graced his face.* - Sun Nov  1 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or do something. As long as it's not. . . - Sun Nov  1 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Training....or fighting. - Sun Nov  1 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For right now...I want neither of those. - Sun Nov  1 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then let's do... - Sun Nov  1 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Whatever feels natural/. - Sun Nov  1 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Whatever we want. - Sun Nov  1 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lying here for a few hours, feels natural. - Sun Nov  1 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then we can do that. - Sun Nov  1 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. . . - Sun Nov  1 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Though it'll be....uncomfortable. - Sun Nov  1 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ....Actually. - Sun Nov  1 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Let's go home.... - Sun Nov  1 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: No....To a hotspring.... - Sun Nov  1 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sun Nov  1 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Sun Nov  1 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) stood up, he wasn't by any means clean, but he did his best to dust himself off, as he smiled a bit. Watching her wipe away her tears, he looked away briefly. Before extending his hand to her, "Shall we go, M'Lady?"* - Sun Nov  1 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) holds her hand lightly within his own, interlocking their fingers should she permit it. As he began walking with her, eventually comming to their own private spa, he could already feel the heat radiating off of it. As he looked towards Katsune he looked at her, he ran a hand through his hair. As he spoke "This should be fun." Almost subconciously.* - Sun Nov  1 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: frown* - Sun Nov  1 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at Kat, as she spoke and something clicked in his mind, as he stepped in front of her he simply spoke.

"You'll have to take it off some day Kat....But when you do. I'll be your armor, I want to be something that when you think of me...You're relaxed...That you feel protected." 

He stated, as he looked to where he held her hand---Assuming he still held it in his own as he spoke:

"I won't let anything happen to you."* - Sun Nov  1 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head as he spoke "I won't force you then..." He stated lightly, he wouldn't rob her sense of security as he spoke "Would you rather we go home to relax...You won't have to take it off...Though, I'm not sure how comfortable sleeping in it will be."* - Sun Nov  1 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as she said "Do that", he was slightly curious as to what her meaning of that was but once again he decided to brush it off for a while, as he slowly began to lead her home if permitted. "Let's go."* - Sun Nov  1 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) leads her to the house and ultimately to their room, as he spoke "What would you like to do...?"* - Sun Nov  1 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiled as he moved to quickly lift Katsune in his arms princess carry style as he spoke "That....Can be arranged." He stated offering her a smile, as e'd slowly approach the bed. Before aiming to sit down upon it, and rest Katsune on his lap as he looked at her he smiled as he spoke "You look really beautiful in that armor."* - Sun Nov  1 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiled as she wrapped her arms around his torso, and nuzzled her face against his chest as she straddled him. He looked to her as she inhaled, and oddly he was liking this Kat who was relaxed a lot. At least she didn't say he stunk, or recoiled, that was a relief. Enjoying her affectionate nuzzling, as her legs tightened against him. His hands moved to her hips, as his right hand moved to her back.

He didn't seem to mind her having her boots on in the slightest, Not that he noticed but he probably would eventually.* - Sun Nov  1 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) leaned forward as she stopped moving and he attempted ot plant a kiss  on the side of her neck as he spoke "Kat, how about I help you relax some more...?" He asked lightly, looking to her as she kept her eyes closed.* - Sun Nov  1 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would slowly smile as she nuzzled her face against his chest again, as he slowly laid her atop of the blanket. And slowly he looked at what she currently had on, he looked at her boots and slowly he began to untie them, before pulling them off, had she permitted it afterwards he'd aim to set her boots off to the side  on the floor. Looking up to her.* - Sun Nov  1 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after he had succesfully removed her shoes he looked up to her, (Yeah he did set her down on her back), and slowly starting with her left leg, he'd gently aim to raise it. A faint blush appeared on his face, as he leaned closer to her foot, planting a gentle kiss on the side, before her ankle, and her calf. The higher he got, the slower, and more sensual each kiss got. And he continued trailing up the leg, until he got to her inner thigh if permitted. Keeping the leg gently supported with his hands.* - Sun Nov  1 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked down to her leg, as he completed the last kiss in the series, his eyes  looked at her face, before he decided to work his way back up, repeating the proces, for her second foot and leg. Before taking her right foot in hand, in which he'd begin slowly massaging, taking care to be gentle, and work out some of the tension which had been without a doubt gathered in the day. His blush remained static, he found every part of Katsune beautiful from the head to her toe.

So as he carefully massaged her foot he looked up to her for signs of approval.* - Sun Nov  1 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) lookd at her as he continued Massaging her foot, taking his time to work out all the tension. As he finished,, he slowly moved to massaging each of the toes on her foot, before leaning forward and given her foot a kiss before focusing on the next. He was enjoying himself, and he hoped she was, but the more he did this, the more excited he was getting, as could be seen with the small bulge that had arisen in his pants as he massaged her.* - Sun Nov  1 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after he finished massaging her second foot, he planted a kiss upon it as an act of completing a task. And slowly his hand began gently massaging her legs, taking his time to repeat the same process for both of them. Before finally he moved to her inner thighs, once again taking a particularly long time, as he massaged this part of her, his movements were gentle. Yet applied a bit of pressure, he didn't mind her reactions, but he was trying to get one out of her. * - Sun Nov  1 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) didn't seem to mind at all, though it was pretty arousing. But he desired to ignore himself and focus on Kat for the duration, he watched as her leg subtly begins rising as she slowly spread her legs, as a response to his massage. And his heart began to race. He noticed her breathing, which only added to his embarrassment. As he planted a kiss on her inner thigh, as his hand moved beneath her leg, keeping it slightly elevated as he moved. Forward, his right hand which was free, gently ran his fingers along her right leg,  just the tips of his fingers.

Aiming to create almost a  'ticklish sensation', as he leaned over her, he bent forward and planted a kiss on her stomach, as his fingertips completed their movement against her inner thigh before they moved to her crotch. Applying a bit more pressure, two fingers ran up the center of her crotch, along the dark purple patch of her body suit, starting from the bottom. Watching her face for a reaction, he seemed to be getting into this.* - Sun Nov  1 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) takes in Kat's form, as he moves, as much as he wanted to, he didn't want to rely solely on focusing on her crotch for the entirety of the time. So with one final rub,his hand moved to atop of her pubic mound,--Well the fabric which rested their, and with his fingers fanned out. He began to move it up, applying a bit of pressure, as he reached her stomach, and slowly his fingers came together, as they met her side, lightly rubbing it. As hie planted a kiss atop of her breasts. At this point, his knee would be moved  between her legs, resting against her but he was concious not to apply any pressure he didn't want to hurt her afterall.

And her left(?) leg was probably between his own due to his positioning. After planting a kiss on her breasts, he'd aim to place one on the base of her neck, before on her shoulder, he probably wouldn't have been able to kiss her any higher than that due to the pillow which resided there. * - Sun Nov  1 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiles warmly, as he looked at Katsune, even through her biting on the pillow. He found that smile somewhat adorable, he didn't mind her gaze, not at all. He welcomed it.  He decided, to mess with Katsune, in the sake of the moment, returning his attention to her neck once again, he'd run his tongue from the point where her collarbone and neck merged, to about half way up her neck. Before afterwards, blowing on it lightly, aiming to send a sort of chill from that point due to the cold air hitting his saliva. 

Afterwards, he focused solely on her neck for a moment, kissing it in different spots, from different angles. As his hand which was previously exploring her side, aimed to find it's way beneath her, and would attempt to rest on her butt.* - Sun Nov  1 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt Katsune's legs wrap around his waist, quite tightly, he didn't seem to mind to much.  Though he was a bit taken by surprise as she suddenly shot forward, and he felt her mouth find his neck, and her teeth biting down upon his flesh. Sending discomfort and pain to radiate throughout his neck. Though the suckling did help, it gave her bite the sense of 'throbbing', almost, but with her tongue going across his flesh, it send small pleasureable chills through his body with each motion.

Of course when she clamped down harder, he noticed it, and it hurt. But not enough to be unbearable.  It was Kat, so he'd bear it, to the best of his abilities, his hand gave her rear a squeezes, as he continued kissing her.* - Sun Nov  1 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I want sleep. - Sun Nov  1 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her release his neck from her teeth, and he felt the throbbing. He wasn't aware of the hickey she had left,  but even so as Katsune nuzzled her head against his neck, his pain was erased from his mind---Though it still did hurt a lot.  He listened to her and nodded his head "Alright~...Goodnight Kat~." He stated, he was drained himself and was probably heading to sleep. He pulled his hand from beneath her, and when she removed her legs from around him, he'd probably roll over beside her.* - Sun Nov  1 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took out the scroll he had bought off of someone whose name he couldn't actually remember, and as he unraveled it, immediately he came to the realisation it was a medical tehnique which was a bit of a turn off, but because that had been confirmed he needn't go outside since there was no risk of risudual damage.

As he began to read the scroll he inhaled followed by a sharp exhale, he noticed the name of the technique was Chakra Scapel, and it was a close range attack. Which was definately a bonus, he smiled to himself, deciding to start with the first paragraph of text, which had ended up being basic information about the technique itself, so he nodded his head and prepared to read it.

As he traced his finger along the text he read "This medical technique forms one's chakra into a small, sharp blade. This can then be used for highly accurate incisions necessary for surgeries and anatomical dissections. Unlike regular scalpels, the chakra scalpel can make cuts inside the body without actually creating an open wound, limiting the risks of an infection."

 He whistled understanding that in the hands of a medical Ninja this technique could do...Great good or great evil. He continued to read:"The chakra scalpel can also be used offensively, although it requires great precision to be effective." After finishing that small section he nodded his head and unraveled the scroll more.

And then he proceeded to finish reading what was listed."Because of this requirement, using the chakra scalpel offensively is highly unusual. In heated combat, even the greatest medical-nin won't be able to exert the precision needed to make fatal cuts, but it can still effectively cut muscle tissues and tendons, rendering the target immobile." After learning all that the scroll had to offer, he nodded his head and proceeded to move onto the next scroll deciding to try them later.* - Sun Nov  1 12:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath and sighed, as he simply looked forward, his hands met at his side. Before moving to reach for his back pouch in which he unsealed another scroll. He nodded his head before focusing, unraveling the scroll he realised it was named Katon Bunshin which would ultimately end up being fairly good to use in battle, so once he read the title. He nodded his head and prepared to begin reading the scroll.

He took a deep breath and focused on the task at hand, he was ultimately preparing to take a leap forward, he wasn't trying to leave Katsune alone at the front lines, he couldn't, he had to focus, so as he opened the scroll he inhaled followed by a brief exhale, as he took a deep breath and his hands were raised to open the scroll in which he held in his hands. 

With a gentle smile, he slowly unraveled the scroll before preparing to read it, tracing his finger along the text he read "This technique allows the user to make a shadow clone infused with fire. Because it is a shadow clone, it is able to perform techniques and interact with the environment due to it having physical substance; and also evenly distributes the user's chakra to each clone. If the clone is injured, it will revert to its natural fire-state, at the same time burning whatever it is touching.""

He noticed this technique, had multiple battle applications, but ultimately he didn't see much of a use outside of battle, in fact, he figured it'd do more harm than good in all actuality, he had to focus though, inhaling before exhaling briefly, as he continued reading the scroll before him, at this point in time he was aiming to get down the handseals which were needed to perform the technique.

At this point, he began practicing the transition from seal to seal, he wanted to have it down to a science before the need to perform it in actual battle was there, so he nodded his head, and smiled to himself, as he felt he had finally begun to grasp this technique. Honestly there was a lot more he felt like he should be doing but he had to focus, and he prepared to move onto the next.
* - Sun Nov  1 12:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath this time he was turning his attention to that of the Pheonix flower jutsu which he intended to be a quick read, he smiled to himself before unraveling the scroll after pulling it out from beneath his bed, slowly he unraveled the scroll, and prepared to take a look at it's text. And nodded his head with a light smile as he simply began to read:

"This technique creates a volley of small fireballs, which are sent flying in an unpredictable manner assaulting the enemy. In addition, the flames are controlled one by one with chakra, so avoiding them all is extremely difficult." After having read that small portion of the scroll, he took a deep breath and nodded his head, smiling warmly, as he preapred to attempt the technique---Then realised he probably shouldn't in doors.

He was practically enjoying this form of simple reading and training it would be ideal after all, it didn't require physical exertion. So he didn't have to go outside, and he could practice it while laying in bed. That was definately a plus, he nodded his head as he decided he hadn't quite grasped the concept of the jutsu.

So taking a deep breath he decided to read over the handseals and such, he needed to get a grasp of them as well so he put in time and effort, into learning about them. He inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he focused and sat there on the bed, after a while he felt like he had a good understanding of the technique at hand so he rested the scroll down.* - Sun Nov  1 13:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Ortho. - Sun Nov  1 13:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sat down atop of the roof of his Sunagakure home, his arms were placed behind his head, as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale. He began to recall the events which led him to this point in time, things that changed him for the better...Made him who he was, But also the things that changed him for the worse, and chipped away parts of his soul. And there were quite a few bits of those.

He recalled Hideki...His Brother, Friend, Comrade...And Teacher. He realised Hideki was a great influence to him, and gave him his first chance. He respected the man greatly, but in Hideki's final moments...He realised that Hideki was a coward....He couldn't accept that the one he adored so much and looked up to in admiration....Would use him as a means to commit suicide.

The thought made his core tremble, it hurt,  he recalled Nina, a little girl he had met, She was also close to his heart he considered her a little sister...He could only imagine the pain she went through..Being alone for so long, she hated life...At such a young age...If only he stepped in sooner, maybe she wouldn't have needed to experience such things.... But he didn't...But he had a chance now...He'd make the most of it.

His mind wandered to the conflict between Katsune and Saeza, which ended up tying into Ortho and Marissa. That hurt him possibly the most,  he felt a tear in all his relationships,  he felt it was inevitable that he'd be forced to pick a side...His Girlfriend...Or His Brother. That was a decision he didn't want to make, it pained him... He felt his blood boiling. He knew no one would be satisified with his decision.

He had endangered Katsune by bringing his work so close to home...He realised he might've put her on Muhhamed's radar...As well as himself...He potentially led them both to their deaths, he felt like his life was spiraling downwards into a black void, devoid of all life. He knew this path he chose would only end one way...With his death.

But he didn't want to die, he had accepted...This world...Was horrible...It was trash... It deserved to be destroyed...He hated it all together, but he had to look at himself, he always intended to be the Hero...But was he? Did he even have any heroic qualities? He was weak...He was easily hurt, he relied on his girlfriend for protection. Physically he'd probably be weaker than a villager. 

He wasn't the best with words, nor could he read social cues. He didn't pick up on hints, and there was a boat load of other problems, which all reflected the deck he had been handed...He felt like the world said fuck him. And right now...It was taking it's time and enjoying the process. He wasn't a Hero, he would never be one.

He was himself, and he had to accept himself for what he was. He wanted to be better, but he was fine....stopping where he was for a while....He was accepting the world around him for what it was, and ultimately he was forgiving himself for his own shortcommings...And forgiving those who had wronged him, He wouldn't hold grudges. Not anymore. He realised that they only weighed him down.

He raised his hand above his face, extending it towards the morning sun to the point where his hand eclipsed it's rays. Before slowly he balled it into a fist, this world was shitty....But it was his world, he lived in it, but even in this world....There was redeeming qualities, he would accept it as it is...And strive to make a better world. He didn't desire to lead people, he'd rather they followed their own paths, just as he had decided to follow his.

In finality, he had decided...Not to be a Hero for others. But become a man himself, in which he could call a Hero.* - Sun Nov  1 13:14:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You say you've formed a contract with a snake called Manda? - Sun Nov  1 14:51:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Would you mind summoning him now? I'd like to request his permission as well. - Sun Nov  1 14:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at the giant snake, as he whistled lightly as he noticed the massive snake, he was definately quite impressed. As he looked at Manda, his arm was raised across his chest, as he stepped forward, and bowed his head to Manda as he spoke "It's truly a pleasure, I'm one of Hideki's students." He stated as he introduced himself before he spoke:

"Much like my Sensei, I truly hate beating around the bush...It isn't my place, But I'd like to request your permission to summon you in battle. Great Snake Manda." 

His voice was calm, he spoke as if his demeanor was collected---He didn't hesitate, and spoke with absolute clarity. * - Sun Nov  1 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked up at the snake, his eyes focused upon the snake before him as he simply stated. "I could tell you, It'd be interesting. I could tell you, It'd be worthwhile. But I believe at the end of the day, It is not my place to judge my worth. It is yours, With all due respect. But there's one thing, I can assure you, Together, Legions of men will bow at our feet." That was all she wrote.

He smiled subtly, as his head remained bowed for a second, before standing up right.* - Sun Nov  1 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked towards Manda as he spoke "I'm not sure if our views and morals coincide,  I simply wish to push this world in another direction. To see the changing of an era." He spoke, sitting down on the ground, as he looked up at the sky. He smiled warmly,  before looking towards Manda.

"My mindset tends to differ from most." He added.* - Sun Nov  1 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) scratched his cheek as he spoke "Thank you, Manda." Before he looked to Ortho, his hand was extended his hand to him as he spoke "I appreciate it, Thank you." He stated offering him a warm smile.* - Sun Nov  1 15:35:40 2015

He looked at her as he spoke "I wouldn't do anything to hurt Nina, And you have time to make it right. So I suggest doing it before she gets to old, You know she told me she's interested in boys? You should talk to her. Not as a Shinobi, But as your sister." He spoke, "It wasn't my place to say that, But you're my brother. Which makes Nina my sister. So as  'family', I hope you'll take that advice."* - Sun Nov  1 15:46:46 2015

So he didn't think of it to much, definately surprised by how long she actually hugged him, so when she stepped back, he looked towards her. Aiming to look into her eyes, as he sighed in relief. A bit curious about what she had planned by backing up, he decided to ask--Perhaps a bit subconciously.
