He joked with her at least aiming to make some small talk as he reached for the dice.* - Sat Nov 14 02:09:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her for a moment a faint reddening of his cheeks could be observed, as his gaze fell towards her chest...There were quite a few possibilities.  He did particularly like this form she had taken, but slowly. He extended his hands forward to her chest, he felt his heart racing. But as they made contact with the fabric of her dress, he'd aim to begin fondling them, getting a feel through her dress, after a few moments his hands would leave her chest. And his gaze shifted to the floor in between them offering her the dice.* - Sat Nov 14 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was surprised by Ume's reaction, having definately caused him some surprise. Causing him to shift almost uncomfortably changing his seated position as he aimed to calm himself, looking to Ume, he scratched his cheek with a single finger as he spoke "Not s-sure, It'd be weird..But it's apart of the game."* - Sat Nov 14 02:20:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) watched as she crouched down, and closed his eyes, as his gaze looked around, it was definately another weird sensation. Feeling the tongue go across his foot, sent a weird tingling throughout the limb. He swallowed hard, before aiming to claim the dice as she sat up before he'd attempt to roll the dice forward.* - Sat Nov 14 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) contemplated the roll of poke thinking it was quite a 'boring' roll. But slowly he leaned forward aiming to extend a single finger, he'd attempt to poke her calf. Before he asked "Do you think we should change, 'poke'? I feel like It's not the best option."* - Sat Nov 14 02:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked as she moved closer, and watched as her hand went beneath his shirt, feeling it rise up to his chest and the soft digits beginning to rub his own flesh. Almost unbelievably soft, he closed his eyes. He was definately enjoying the feeling, and bit his bottom lip gently with a sigh of relaxation.* - Sat Nov 14 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: That feels nice? - Sat Nov 14 02:42:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) enjoyed it as she massaged his chest, it was definately relaxing at least in that portion of his body, but after a moment he reached for the dice and rolled it forward.* - Sat Nov 14 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) once again had gotten the chance to poke her, and as such he looked towards her stomach and extended a single finger, attempting to poke her.* - Sat Nov 14 02:45:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You and Ortho are very strong, and even if I don't fight hardly ever you are both clearly much stronger than me but neither of you have just -taken- what you wanted from me. I am unsure why. - Sat Nov 14 02:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) didn't seem to mind it, as she lifted his foot, feeling her hands massaging it along his arch. He released a subtle sigh of relaxation as he spoke "I should have you do this more often.." He spoke with a warm smile, once she was done he'd take the dice and roll.* - Sat Nov 14 03:07:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head "Y-Yeah...A-Alright.." He stated, looking at her leg, and then to her skirt, he'd slowly aim to take the bottom of the skirt, and raise it up. Looking at her leg as it was unveiled to him, he felt his heart racing all the faster, but he stopped before unveiling her crotch. He then proceeded to offer her the dice.* - Sat Nov 14 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn... - Sat Nov 14 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) swallowed as he looked at her legs, his sight just being depraved from seeing her sex. And it was only so much more arousing, he felt the heat in his body increasing, signs of his arousal increasing.  He looked at her roll, and he was even more surprised, when she suddenly raised his shirt he felt her fingers running over his body, and grazing over his right nipple, which sent small chills through his body.And what came next, he was in no way expecting, feeling her lips surround his nipple as she sucked, it sent small pleasured chills through his body, which were amplified and mixed with pain as she bit down. 

That definately was a new sensation to him, causing him to whince, as he gasped out in a bit of pain, mixed with hints of pleasure. He had definately never had this zone explored, and when her tongue repeatedly moved over it,he bit on his bottom lip. Feeling her enroaching upon his lap, he felt himself slowly getting hard, which was a miracle considering all that has happened, he was nearly pushed off the edge when she released her moan.* - Sat Nov 14 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: More pressure means gasp. - Sat Nov 14 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he looked towards her, there was a noticable bulge in his pants, and his blush was very much apparent as he spoke "Y-Yeah...I-It was g-good."* - Sat Nov 14 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Lick...your leg. - Sat Nov 14 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he looked at her, slowly he'd crouch down before her. Lifting her right leg, he'd slowly look at it, taking a deep breath before he swallowed hard. He'd lean forward with his tongue extended, he'd place it lightly against her calf, before slowly moving it up her leg. Moving to her thigh, before her inner thigh, as he tried to look at her sex, or rather that was where he was facing. He swallowed hard, he seemed to enjoy the softness of her flesh against his tongue and he was slightly curious to if she had a taste.* - Sat Nov 14 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) heard her breathing increase, and man did that only add to his arousal...He knew what he wanted to do...He couldn't not yet...But he found his gaze drawn to her sex, after a moment he raised his head and looked towards her swallowing hard.* - Sat Nov 14 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Nnngn.... - Sat Nov 14 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) after a moment he lowered her leg back down looking at her next roll, he felt like he was probably in trouble.* - Sat Nov 14 03:47:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked as she spoke, finding her words oddly flattering but also on the weirder side. "S-Struggling?...M-Me tasting good..?"* - Sat Nov 14 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her and swallowed hard, "Y-You're hungry?" He asked staring at her, for the briefest of moments he had forgotten what her diet consisted of. But looked away as she leaned against him, it was hard to think when he was hard.* - Sat Nov 14 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "W-Would you p-prefer a r-reroll...? Or t-to find you something to e-eat?"

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Even though it wouldn't linger with a taste. - Sat Nov 14 04:24:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nods his head before rolling.* - Sat Nov 14 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head as his eyes shifted down to her legs, and he swallowed hard. Slowly he leaned forward, starting from her calf, he began planting light kisses. Becomming more 'lust full' as he climbed higher up her leg up until her inner thigh. His tongue ran across the soft flesh, once before repeating the same thing on the other leg, after he had finished, he'd move to lift her legs and rest them atop of his lap, and subsequently atop of his erection.* - Sat Nov 14 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Rub...Lips. - Sat Nov 14 04:40:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) noticed not only did it look strange it felt strange, but her soft fingers made it bearable. As he reached for the dice.* - Sat Nov 14 04:41:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Sat Nov 14 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) slowly looks at Ume, as he took a deep breath leaning forward his hands would find her legs as he moved aiming to place a kiss on her neck. Holding his lips against her soft flesh for a few moments, before sitting back down. And had he needed to move her legs to do this, they were placed back on his lap afterwards.* - Sat Nov 14 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) shook his head as he spoke "I think it'd be awkward." He admitted with a nod of his head.* - Sat Nov 14 05:04:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked as she kissed his feet, his gaze was averted to the side, before he moved to grasp the dice and rolled them.* - Sat Nov 14 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Suckle...On your lips.. - Sat Nov 14 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Are...Y-You alright...with that..? - Sat Nov 14 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah. - Sat Nov 14 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Wait. - Sat Nov 14 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Is that like a kiss? - Sat Nov 14 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Y-Yeah I suppose.. - Sat Nov 14 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...yeah, it's okay. - Sat Nov 14 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) noticably got harder beneath her legs, as he looked at her lips. He swallowed hard, before he'd lean forward. Aiming to place his lips against hers with a bit of hesitation due to embarrassment, but once their lips touched. He'd attempt to make the kiss a bit more passionate, he didn't have a lot of experience and that much was apparent. Even attempting to invade her mouth with his tongue, which probably had nothing to do with the dare.* - Sat Nov 14 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) felt his tongue moving against hers, the beautiful friction it created sent chills down his spine. After a moment more, he slowly broke the kiss with a light gasp. He stared at her through lust-crazed eyes. He definately wanted more, but this game was restricting him and the dice were offered back.* - Sat Nov 14 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked away briefly, he didn't see the roll but his attention was on her question. "Y-Yeah...The f-first time I-I've ever kissed like that."* - Sat Nov 14 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked as she stated the roll and his eyes shifted to the dice, and he swallowed hard. Before he was able to comprehend what had happened, her legs had left her lap and her hand had found his bulge feeling it moving across it. He released a pleasured gasp, as he heard her speak as he spoke "M-Maybe..I-I think that w-we should d-do that from now on..." He stated, awefully embarrassed but he seemed to be desiring a greater touch as well.* - Sat Nov 14 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) felt her begin to undo his pants before her hands began massaging his length, the feeling of being liberated coupled with her touch caused him to release a subtle moan, he was definately enjoying the extra attention she was giving him. He felt his arousal mounting by the second, he was resisting every urge to just pounce, "T-That's g-great U-Ume!"* - Sat Nov 14 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Alright....I need to call it a night... - Sat Nov 14 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) assumably fell asleep in her room, after last night. He'd stir for a bit before his eyes opened blinking a few times, as he aimed to get adjusted to the light. "M-Mornin'.."* - Sat Nov 14 13:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) for a moment a confused look crossed his face, but it began to shift into somewhat embarrassment causing his gaze to shift away. He didn't need to ask what stuff, he had put two and two together and the memories of last night were already surging back to him, it wasn't like morning wood wasn't a thing. "R-Really? Y-You tasted it..?" He asked, slightly embarrassed to be inquiring further.* - Sat Nov 14 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) slowly began to look at her as he spoke "A-And...Was it...g-good?" He asked, though he immediately regretted asking, he wondered how long she had been watching him.* - Sat Nov 14 13:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It was.... interesting. - Sat Nov 14 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Sticky. - Sat Nov 14 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I-I see... - Sat Nov 14 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Anyhow, why didn't the scientists come yesterday? - Sat Nov 14 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I'm not sure...Maybe something happened? - Sat Nov 14 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: I'll go check. - Sat Nov 14 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Well are they coming today? - Sat Nov 14 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: If they're available would you like them to come now or later? - Sat Nov 14 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Now. - Sat Nov 14 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: This is taking so long. - Sat Nov 14 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head as he stood, and slowly he headed to the room, after fixing his clothes. He'd head down the hall, and return in a few minutes along with the Calm lady from before who had helped with Ume, she was wheeling in a cart full of various injections since the ideal goal was to get the serum into her body to stimulate a reaction similar to the ones that caused emotions. These were just prototypes, he wondered if they'd work, or have some interesting effects. But he slowly laid down on the bed leaving the two of them to their devices.

"I apologize for the delay Ume-san, we were hoping to work out some kinks with the prototypes. But we can begin now...We have a choice for you, we can begin with specific emotions...Such as happiness, and sadness...Is there any you'd like to try for first? It'll be temporary for the most part, but we'll be observing your reactions to improve...For a more permanent effect."* - Sat Nov 14 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||Looked at Ume as she spoke "We're intending to use injections, to get the stimuli into your body." She explained, as she contemplated what she should start with, eventually she decided that if possible she should have Ume's first emotion be happiness, so she prepared an injection, it held a yellow liquid in it.  Before she'd slowly attempt to approach Ume, reaching for her arm if permitted as she'd aim to align the needle to where the vein would normally be.

And if permitted inject the girl, it'd feel almost hot going into her body, but she'd probably feel it moving through her body. "Just relax, forget I'm here..Don't focus on the serum and we'll see if it comes to fruitation."* - Sat Nov 14 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ....You are still trying to treat me like a human. - Sat Nov 14 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) moved over to sit by her side as the scientist backed up he'd look to her " Do you feel any different?"* - Sat Nov 14 14:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked when he saw her smile developing, it was a weird smile...One he hadn't seen on Ume's face before, She spoke, he was genuinely surprised. "Y-You...Look happy!" He stated, a smile etched across his own face. As he spoke "No...nothing is wrong....This is probably what...was intended to happen...You look happy---Although a bit foolish." He added that last line at the end for teasing purposes, he didn't expect -any- actual progress this soon, it was only about three weeks in, which was almost startling.

|The scientist said nothing and just observed, but a cocky smile could be seen she wrote some notes down, and waited for Ume to come down from her drug-induced happiness.* - Sat Nov 14 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) found himself laughing alongside her, laughing was contaigious, She seemed to be enjoying herself so he was as well. He watched for a good while, he had never recalled hearing her in a fit of laughter. "Does it?--Well I suppose it would." He was enjoying this sight.,and probably wouldn't forget it anytime soon.* - Sat Nov 14 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Using a syringe was not effective, I had to waste energy. - Sat Nov 14 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I had to force it through my cells. - Sat Nov 14 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) he wish he could record this reaction of hers, But such technology didn't actually exist, He was fairly excited by the progress that was made, and he nodded his head before listening to Ume's words, after her excitement had died down.

| The Scientist took notes some more, and nodded her head as she spoke "I see. We'll have to make a more efficient way for your cells to let it in..." She casually muttered "Maybe if we make something similar to insulin to tell her cells to accept it, rather than having her force it through would work..." But she figured she'd pitch that idea later.

"Were you surprised that it worked? As much as I was?" She joked.* - Sat Nov 14 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||Thought about this for a moment, as she nodded her head "We'll think of something." She was fairly excited by this small amount of success. She had a line up of injections left,  "Would you be able to bear it for the remainder of the injections...? It'd take a few days to come up with another system for absorption."* - Sat Nov 14 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: ...right, yes. Okay, I'll just have to reserve energy later. - Sat Nov 14 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) rolls the tray up to Ume, There was six total injections, "Pick one...." There were quite a few, but all the labels were facing down. She was aiming to make the roll a bit more exciting, and surprise them all.* - Sat Nov 14 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ||The Scientist picked up the syringe, before aligning it with her arm once again, before she intended to drive the needle home.* - Sat Nov 14 14:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) watched as she was injected and was surprised when she said 'ow', he didn't understand "You felt that one?" He asked curiously. When she asked the scientist flipped the needle as she spoke "Hm..This one is seeing how your body will react to 'pain'." She replied, And Yosuke's eyes found Ume's body as she began to twitch, and when he heard her screaming. His heart litterally sank, as he moved to grab her hand "U-Ume?!" He declared looking to the doctor.

"Help her!"He declared.

And the Doctor looked almost stunned it seemed like neither of them were expecting such a reaction, he was scared for Ume's sake, what -if- this was actually destroying her from the inside. "G-Get something now!" And the doctor scurried from the room heading to the lab, why she didn't prepare for this was byond him. "U-Ume...F-Focus You'll be alright...Ume..." He couldn't believe this.

It was going so well, but he was faced with the possibility of losing her, and he didn't want to...Not now...Not ever, he was honestly considering canceling the entire project her sake..If they made it out of this, He attempted to grasp her hand, applying a small amount of pressure. "F-Focus on my voice Ume."* - Sat Nov 14 15:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) couldn't believe this, the sound of her screams felt like they were stabbing at his heart, he was scared for her safety. And when she changed back, he knew something was absolutely wrong, His breathing became rigid, and his heart raced. "Someone bring her something!" He shouted,  And the scientist ran back into the room. They had nothing, because they doubted she'd be able to manipulate any injections through her bod yin this state. 

He felt like his world was starting to break apart all over again. "Ume...Ume....Ume....You'll be fine.." He stated, deciding not to rub her back or try to touch her since it seemed to cause her more pain.  He was furious, and if he was able to he'd be so furious he'd start tearing up. Only god knows how much he wanted to tear out this scientist's throat.* - Sat Nov 14 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) probably went deaf from the screaming but when it had died down, he wondered if it was over..And against better judgement, his hand would move to find her back, as she laid in the ball. He'd lean over her for a moment, "Ume...." He muttered, before he motioned for the Scientist to leave, there wouldn't be anymore tests for a bit.  His hand would slowly begin to move up and down her back, in an attempt to comfort her, he didn't care about her current form's appearance, and only if she was alright. That was probably traumatizing for her. "I'm here for you...Ume."* - Sat Nov 14 15:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "It....seems like that was pain.." He stated lightly, continuing to gently stroke her back.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) attempted to move closer into a position that could almost be considered cuddling as he spoke "Ume...." He stated, attempting to pull her closer to him, so he could hug her from behind it probably wasn't the most comfortable..But he was aiming to comfort her.* - Sat Nov 14 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) felt absolutely lost for the first time in a while, he didn't have anything to say...He didn't know what to do, so he just laid there holding her trembling body against his own. * - Sat Nov 14 15:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) contemplated it, as he flipped them all over, he found there were two left he made sure to check the labels. As he spoke "I promise you...These two won't be like the last one. But there are two, I haven't decided on..." There were two in his hands, one was red the other pink. "Your pick.."* - Sat Nov 14 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head aligning it with her arm, he took a deep breath and attempted to inject it into her. This one was lust, But he had no type of luck, he felt like this of all things wouldn't have much of an effect and wouldn't get her mind off of the subject.* - Sat Nov 14 16:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head he was a bit saddened by this revelation, he hadn't put one and two together. But he slowly nodded before readying the next injection "Are you ready?" He'd ask, since the first one hadn't done anything it was safe to assume it was a dud, so he'd line up the shot, and when she gave her approval. He'd aim to inject her, with the one which would stimulate feelings of  'love'.* - Sat Nov 14 16:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What about the other ones? - Sat Nov 14 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: They'll cause....The 'badder' emotions. - Sat Nov 14 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Which emotions? - Sat Nov 14 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Anger...Fear... - Sat Nov 14 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: But those make a person whole? - Sat Nov 14 16:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Pain...that was not an emotion... I didn't -feel- anything but hurting. - Sat Nov 14 16:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head as he reached for the injection for the shot which would induce fear, aligning it with her vein, he'd aim to push it in before allowing the fluid to be manipulated by her.* - Sat Nov 14 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Did I break? - Sat Nov 14 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: No clue.. - Sat Nov 14 16:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Let's try one more. - Sat Nov 14 16:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) found another needle which was labled  "Arousal" Which aimed to make her experience a state of arousal, in which case he'd aim to inject it into her body.* - Sat Nov 14 16:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) scratched his cheek, as he called for one of the scientists who bought in the three syringes he had just tested another of the same version. If he had done it wrong maybe they should re-test, "Maybe.." He stated as a female doctor approached, taking the needle which was fear. She'd attempt to inject Ume...Properly.* - Sat Nov 14 16:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was...stunned, so much so he didn't react as the needle for anger was jammed into the scientist's throat. "Seems like she's got this done." He muttered, but he immediately moved to wrap his arms around her in a tight hug, aiming to keep her still. "Calm down...Calm...Down..."He spoke, aiming to talk her out of the trance,  making sure he came off as being calm. But the scientist, who knew how he'd react. She might've been dead, but he doubted she'd be standing up soon, with that serum coursing through her veins.* - Sat Nov 14 16:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) would aim to pull her onto his lap, while holding her tightly "Come on....Calm down Ume....Fight it...Fight it." He muttered, as she jerked around aiming to keep her for the most part still so no one else took a needle to the neck.* - Sat Nov 14 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) once she had went slack in his arms,his grip around her lessened but he was still hugging her in a sense. Keeping her against him, as he thought to himself "This is...A lot more than I asked for.." He mutted, after a moment a single arm would be moved from around her and simply moved to carress er hair, waiting for her to regenerate, and wake up. He was slightly scared at first, but then he realised she couldn't die.* - Sat Nov 14 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) wasn't so lewd as to do stuff while she was sleep...Not that he didn't want to. But he kept himself in check, calling for a scientist, which dragged the other one off, maybe she could be saved. But slowly he leaned back on the bed, laying down, and subsequently, pulling her down on top of him, allowing her head to rest on his chest.* - Sat Nov 14 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was hugging her lightly, and his gaze looked at her as he spoke "The medicine...was a bit to strong for you.." He stated, with a light sigh. He had to remember to take her to the morgue later, as he spoke "How do you feel?"* - Sat Nov 14 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Normal...sort of. - Sat Nov 14 16:58:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ran a hand along her back as he spoke "That's fine." He stated leaning to give her a kiss on the head.* - Sat Nov 14 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) whispers: You cried. - Sat Nov 14 17:04:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) arrived at the scene, coincidentally, and almost immediately decided to turn around...This was...not his problem. Maybe he should direct from the side lines.."Nope..." Using other Shinobi as Decoys for his own escape was becomming more and more appealing...He wasn't suicidal...But wait...There are beautiful girls present! "I can get a fan club out of this..." He thought about it, as he stayed off to the side. Debating which course of action would be ideal.* - Sat Nov 14 19:15:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) felt waves....And waves...of powerful chakra hitting him...It was alluring....Drawing him in, his breathing began to grow heavier, as small balls of chakra began seeping from his pores, his gaze settled on the massive beast...An unquenchable thirst appeared in his mouth. He closed his eyes and once they re-opened his pupils were not slits, predatorial style, he felt hate....A desire to kill rising up in his stomach...A rough beast-like purr, began to rise from his throat. The development of chakra around his person becomming denser in the way of a cloak.* - Sat Nov 14 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) thinks: Never trust Jirun smh. - Sat Nov 14 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked around at all those present, he took a deep breath. As his hands were raised to chest level as he lept backward. Completing a series of handseals,  as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale-----A massive...Amount of water shot from his lips towards Rokubi. It was powerful, and destructive, wasting no time, clearing the gap towards it's target, threatening to take Inobi and Dagu along with it, he seemingly had lost the ability to care about any potential casualities.

His mind was focused on the beast, and he released a snarl of sorts, he wanted to destroy it...To kill it...His chakra was rising by the seconds, his predatorial gaze settled on his targets.* - Sat Nov 14 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Sisbro55) says: ------ - Sat Nov 14 19:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) eyes widened the moment he saw the Bijuu ball released, and he kicked off his left leg, propelling himself into the sky as his weight was more than eliminated. And he found himself hovering in the sky, shooting up as fast as he could to avoid the ball which was comming towards him, once again, there was a lack of care for anyone else's well being. So he made no attempt to save anyone, if they died it was their fault in his mind. 

He was in his own world for the most part, he focused on his own survival...Kill them all let god sort it out.* - Sat Nov 14 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) extended both hands forward aimed at the Rokubi, flames began to spiral around his body before gathering against the center of his palms. Before being expelled forward, as a massive whirlwind of flames, aimed at devouring this beast entirely. He didn't hold back a bit, his intention was to destroy, and he released a subtle growl as he attempted this attack. IF there were Shinobi who got in the way....Oh well..

He stared down his target with his slitted pupils, he felt the fierce desire, to destroy this...See it reduced to nothing, the explosion that occured beneath him took up almost none of his focus. If people died, that was a personal problem, and with his attack he wouldn't mind killing a person or two who got caught inbetween.* - Sat Nov 14 20:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) took immediate notice of the opening which had been created, and his hands raised to make a single handseal. Before he took notice of the tail which was comming towards them, he wasn't sure if activating light weight rock would be ideal because a tail of that size and speed would create a current. So he sunk into the ground hoping to avoid being blown away. After he had taken notice of the slug's tail passing over head he'd resurface. And prepare to launch an attack..* - Sat Nov 14 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) ran his tongue across his lips, as he focused on the Rokubi, immediately his hands were raised to chest level. Creating a single handseal, as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, quite a few wind bullets were sent towards the Rokubi's weak spot. The cloak which surrounded the boy seemed as if it was preparing for a meal, all his strikes were aimed at the spaces where the oil had been destroyed, aiming to weaken it significantly. He wasted no time aiming to dismantle this beast.

A growl could be heard escaping his lips, as his slitted pupils focused on the beast. He was wasting no time...None at all* - Sat Nov 14 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) took a deep breath as his hands were extended towards the beast as the tremors began. The flames circled his body, before gathering into a swirling mass at his hands, before being shot forward towards the Rokubi's weakspot. He held nothing back, he was aiming to completely weaken this beast...He wanted to hear it's screams, the cloak around him seemed to shift, as he released a predatorial growl. "I'll...destroy...you." He muttered.* - Sat Nov 14 21:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) moved forward, the Bijuu's cloak stood firmly around his person, as he cleared the final gap to the Rokubi, his hand shot out to the area of it's flesh that had had it's oil's withered down greatly. He'd aim to place his hand upon the flesh, and taking a deep breath he'd inhale followed by a great exhale, as his chakra suddenly flared, focusing on the beast but he made sure to keep tabs on everyone present. His chakra would aim to invade the beast's body. Taking a deep breath, inhaling followed by a deep exhale.* - Sat Nov 14 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) focused on the point of contact he shared with the Rokubi, his chakra aiming to sap away the Rokubi's own chakra, he focused. His impressive amount of control comming into play here. He had a goal that he desired to accomplish, "You..." He muttered his slitted pupils staring into the subdued beast. He wasted no time, "I will...assimilate you.." He whispered beneath his breath, his mind seemed warped, as he played tug of war with the large beast, aiming to pull away it's soul.

Take in it's entire being.

"You will be mine." 

He continued to pull, slowly sapping away the beasts chakra most likely, taking it in...Gaining more ground, and enroaching upon it's being..."Submit...Submit...Submit!"* - Sat Nov 14 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inobu(Punka) thinks: What's...happening? - Sat Nov 14 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was focused on his target at the moment, so he wasn't paying attention...He was focused on the beast before him. And the adrenaline rush surging through his veins, the chakra which he was taking in seemed to increase in power, his flow of chakra becomming almost monstrous. "I will.....I will.." He muttered, his heart was racing, and when the curses came towards him, his chakra was flaring sparatically, and would probably repel in attempt to stop his movements. He watched the Bijuu's chakra, comming from it's form.

The sight of the chakra was so alluring, he was almost in a trance. "You will...be mine!" He declared, the chakra continued being sucked out, regardless of the state of the Rokubi against the curse,  he felt the strength flowing around his body...He felt alive.* - Sat Nov 14 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) was over here sucking away the essence of this slimy tentacle monster. Taking a deep breath he felt the splash of water against his back. Which sent some chills through his body, but he was hell bent in taking in the entirety of Rokubi's essence. Appreciative of the help he had been receiving, he took his time, regulating his breathing. The power flooding his veins was almost unimaginable, he felt...Strong...energized...He felt like a King...This was a major high.* - Sat Nov 14 23:12:38 2015

He muttered, his breathing became heavier, and his K-9's sharpened to a point.  "Mine...Mine...Mine!" He declared, his hand pressing harder into the beast. "You...Are -mine-." He declared, giving it another push, his chakra aiming to tear free the rest of the beast's chakra.He felt some force upon his body, but he wasn't sure if it'd take grasp of his body completely.* - Sat Nov 14 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) aimed to take in the next bit of chakra from the Rokubi, inhaling followed by a deep exhale. His mind felt clear...While he was absorbing this chakra. He took a deep breath and inhaled, "I want, the rest of your essence...Feed it to me." He stated, aiming to take in another portion of the beast's power.* - Sun Nov 15 00:08:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) lept upon the beast's side if the spot which was oil-less was still present. As he aimed to give it one final push.

He declared, his hands being raised to chest level, he made a single handseal, as he gathered his breath, inhaling followed by a deep exhale large spheres of wind were released from his lips, aiming at breaking through the bindings which trapped him, at least to make a hole big enough for him to escape through.

He had been playing around...For way to long now..."No...No...No more...I'm tired of these games...All of them." Had a hole been opened, he'd aim to leap from it, not caring how high he was in the air.* - Sun Nov 15 00:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) noticed the small dent he had put in it, and after a moment, his hands found the walls, and his chakra was channeled into the cage. Immediately, it'd go weightless, and begin rising from the ground. Heading back towards the ship if succeeded, and after a moment he'd restore it's weight aiming to have it crash back against the ground. Probably a crude method that he'd attempt to repeat repeatedly. Aiming to eventually wear down the bindings, and either bring the helicopter down, or break whatever chain or rope connected the cage to the helicopter.* - Sun Nov 15 01:01:00 2015

Yes he had just, dislocated his shoulder.

With the new freed space,he aimed to shift his body to the side. So that if the stab continued, it'd either make contact with his now dislocated shoulder or Hip. "F-Fuck!" He declared, looking towards the other two. He was in a bad position, and he sure as hell wasn't going to be casting any jutsu anytime soon. He was in...quite the ordeal.* - Sun Nov 15 01:22:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) felt the blade drive itself into his shoulder, and the cry he released echoed through the surrounding areas. His vision blurred for a moment, as the sound of his bone cracking resonated in his ears.  The pain overflowing his system, "F-Fuck....Fuck..." He muttered, the pain was way past the point of crying--And he would've if the pain wasn't as bad. He couldn't focus on crying at the moment. 

Not only was it now dislocated, it was broken. Placing him at a very steep disadvantage. His survival right now relied solely on Kana and Ortho's work. but then suddenly...His assailant retreated back into the ship. Which definately wasn't good for him.* - Sun Nov 15 01:51:21 2015

And slowly, his cloak began to die down...He had been holding it for a while now, he was drained. He wasn't sure about the extent of the injuries to his arm either.* - Sun Nov 15 02:33:10 2015

The pain surged through his body before he looked at both of the people present before to Ortho specifically.

"I think it's time, I take you with me Ortho." He glanced to Kana as he spoke "I'd appreciate you comming as well." He didn't trust these village medics, and for the most part he had ignored everyone who didn't have relevance to this situation.* - Sun Nov 15 02:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) takes this time to depart while everyone was distracted. He needed to get treated.* - Sun Nov 15 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) wanders into the room, followed by a horde of Scientists, and medics, as he entered he fell to the ground. There was a lot of blood soaking his clothes, and his arm looked almost obviously dislocated, he was in pain.* - Sun Nov 15 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) as she approached him, she may notice, depending on how indepth her analysis was. His arm was in fact dislocated, with practically a -hole- going through his shoulder's bone. It was fractured, and broken in multiple places.* - Sun Nov 15 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) felt something being stuffed into his injured arm, which caused him to grunt in pain. It hurt a lot, but suddenly he felt the pain being sapped away....Slowly...His wound began to heal..The flesh which was pierced began to find itself healing at an accelerated pace, closing up until it was perfectly normal. A vast majority of his pain was gone, and that was great, but his arm was still dislocated. The scientists seemed almost stunned by this but immediately one of them ran over.

Placing an arm on his collar bone, before grasping his arm and pushing upwards. And man did he scream, the pain was almost agonizing. But he managed to remain conciousness...He had inflicted this injury himself in order to stay alive. But somehow...He had a guardian angel. He was protected and saved, he'd have to thank them.

He panted heavily for a few minutes,out of pure trauma he was afraid to remove his blood soaked shirt and coat. 

"H-How....Is this...possible?" He stated, noticing his pain was gone.* - Sun Nov 15 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) still couldn't believe this, as he went to remove his coat, followed by his shirt, with some difficulty since he had just dislocated his shoulder. And when he did, he revealed his skin had healed perfectly, but he'd need a bath, a lot of blood was on his skin.* - Sun Nov 15 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) blinked as he spoke.."Wow...truly...you're more amazing...every time I see you.."He muttered, but he looked at his bloodied clothes and body as he spoke "I should probably go wash up and clean my clothes...Probably is unsanitary to leave them on the floor."* - Sun Nov 15 03:58:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Maybe you should go clean up. - Sun Nov 15 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) traced her gaze as he simply spoke "Why don't you join me...? Seems like you can use some cleaning yourself." He stated, with a light smile.* - Sun Nov 15 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her as he would've said "You could try it." If he didn't feel like it'd be weird, but slowly he'd aim to grasp her hand, and slowly he'd lead her off to the bathroom which was litterally in the room anyway. There was a tub that was obviously designed more for one person than for two. And he began to set the water as he asked "Have you eaten since you've come here?"* - Sun Nov 15 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: B-but then... - Sun Nov 15 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) contemplated what she said as he then, moved to slowly begin undressing til the point he was down to his boxers, piling everything up before he looked to Ume, as he spoke "We'll handle that tonight." He stated with a nod of his head. Before his thumbs found the waistband of his underwear pulling them down to his ankles, exposing himself to the girl, before he moved to get into the water, with a subtle gasp as the heat of the water set in against his flesh.* - Sun Nov 15 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head, for a bit, as he moved to dip a rag into the water, before motioning for her to give him her hand. In which case, he'd begin rubbing it clean, taking his time with it as he released her hand, he motioned for her to come and join him.* - Sun Nov 15 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) watched as she got into the small tub with him as he spoke "I don't honestly remember...When I got near...I felt my anger boiling, I wanted to fight...I wanted to hurt things...It was definately weird." He stated. He looked at her curious if she was still wearing stuff,but regardless. His hand would move to rest on her leg in the water assuming she was facing him.* - Sun Nov 15 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head, as he spoke "Yeah, It's perfect...I definately owe you." He stated with a warm smile. For whatever reason, he had his legs, spread or attempted to to have her own legs between his own. As he asked "Man....I never knew you could do that though...How do you feel after that?"* - Sun Nov 15 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head "Even so I'm greatful, I was in a lot of pain and you saved me." He stated relaxing in the tub, his hand gave her leg a final rub as he looked at her.* - Sun Nov 15 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: mi - Sun Nov 15 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) slowly his hand shifted to her foot as he aimed to lightly lift it, deciding to help her out a bit. Even though she probably wouldn't mind or care,he'd begin subtly massaging her foot taking his time, and being careful.* - Sun Nov 15 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) nodded his head, and slowly he rested her foot down atop of his crotch despite having no fabric to seperate them. "Yeah...I have, I intend to handle them within the next day." He explained lightly.* - Sun Nov 15 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her once before he simply spoke "Kill them of course." He proceeded to stand for a moment as he would've normally said something else he simply spoke. "I invited Ortho here in three days." He spoke lightly, as he began to dry himself off.* - Sun Nov 15 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "Because, I stole from the Gezo. And he fought alongside me, We're both in equal danger."* - Sun Nov 15 12:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What does that have to do..with inviting him here/ - Sun Nov 15 12:47:34 2015
