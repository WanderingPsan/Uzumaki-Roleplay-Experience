<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared down at her "Friends?" He asked, he once again couldn't fathom it, as he crouched down before her. As he simply stated "Forget about him, My pet." He stated, as his hand moved to her head, rubbing it gently. As he spoke:

"If you talk about him again, I will punish you. Until you won't be able to coherently speak the word friend again for a few days." He stated,  staring into her eyes. As he watched her expression, her hate? He loved it.* - Thu Nov 26 23:19:28 2015

* - Thu Nov 26 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, as he noticed her refusal to meet his own gaze,and his hand immediately swung. Aiming to smack her across the cheek, "I told you before, You -will- look me in the eyes when we speak. Yuriko." He'd slowly smile before, moving to rub where he had just smacked, compassionately as if he had never stricken her had it landed. He knew it didn't hurt as he spoke "Let's try this again."You are -never-, going to speak about him. Or try to betray my trust, again. Do.You.Understand?"* - Thu Nov 26 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled lightly, as he focused on her. "Good." He stated, looking down to her as he spoke "Take my hand." Offering it to her, as he looked to Yori. "I'm considering, sending a letter out, warn the guards ahead of time, If you will. I'd rather not have to re-write." He stated lightly, as he took out a letter he had wrote some time ago, and asked "And could you run this to the science department?"* - Thu Nov 26 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took her hand, and slowly he handed Yori the note. Before he began to lead Yuriko, away towards the Garden room.* - Thu Nov 26 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) as he led her into the room. The door was closed, and locked, he looked at her as he simply spoke "Strip."   His gaze focused on her person, he was being a lot more forceful than before. And he moved to sit on the floor. He was obvious -very-, angry. "When you do, sit in front of me." He stated, moving to take a seat on the dirt not caring for the current condition of his clothes.* - Thu Nov 26 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "Speak your mind." He stated, he was giving her the floor to speak. His eyes drifted over her pink nipples for a second, before looking back up to her face. He'd stare at her, as he spoke "This may be the only time." He warned, he definately didn't hold the same opinion of her anymore, not now. He stared at her, knowing she didn't hold the same of him. "You know what you're thinking so, don't tell me you don't understand." He added as a warning.* - Fri Nov 27 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared at her as he spoke "You heard what I said, do not make me repeat myself, Ume." He stated calling her by her original name.* - Fri Nov 27 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: ...Ume. - Fri Nov 27 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared into her eyes, and once she had finished he closed his eyes for a moment as he spoke "Or perhaps, you were more right that I thought. I felt...Jealous, that he may be taking you from me." He paused, as he spoke "You're right, about all of this, Ume, I have been taking your stuff, killing your guards. I was wrong for binding you." He spoke, he seemed to truly believe his words, "Putting me back in my cell would've been reasonable, but in that moment. Killing me would've been a more permanent solution." He stated, as he  took a deep breath. "So I apologize, Ume. Where do we go from here?" He still didn't see the value of a single man's life, he never would. He looked at her and for once he gave her power, to decide. Out of neccessity,  he was testing her. But not a hint would show on his face.* - Fri Nov 27 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, as she spoke he truly enjoyed her words. As he simply spoke "I see." He looked towards her once again as he spoke "One week. That's the time line. Starting from tomorrow, in exactly one week's time. I will put my fate in your hands, Yuriko. Kill me, imprison me. Try to do what you wish at that time. But for now, There's something I want."   He raised a single finger, and motioned for her to come here as he spoke "Lay across my lap." He commanded. He had learned something interesting...She couldn't avoid his genjutsu, It intrigued him. * - Fri Nov 27 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) helped her accordingly, so that she was laying across his lap on her stomach, with her butt up. As his hand lowered to her butt, resting lightly on her cheek. Rubbing along the curve of her ass, he'd look at her as he spoke "Ideally, what is your Ideal Master like?" He asked, not that he neccessarily had any intention to change, but he was curious.* - Fri Nov 27 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes for a second as she spoke, and as he reopened them he spoke "I see, I'm not doing a good job of meeting  those expectations. Am I?" He spoke in an almost joking tone, as he aimed to spread her cheeks slowly, with his hand, gazing down towards her sex and her pucker. As his left finger moved, and gently ran across her backdoor, tracing around the rim. As he spoke "Believe it or not, I do value our relationship. I learn a lot from you, more than you may ever find out. I've learned my weaknesses." * - Fri Nov 27 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked down towards her butt, as his finger, poked against the entrance to her back door as he spoke "I will not do, more than this. Unless you say it's alright, I looked at you as an object. But when you spoke to me, I saw life. I will change what I see fit, to make sure this relationship thrives. "But, I'll need you to work with me as well." He stated, his other hand, rubbing her ass with subtle gropes.* - Fri Nov 27 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes for a minute as he spoke "Let's work past that hate, no matter how long it takes. But I will not, do it. As long as it takes for you to believe me." He stated aiming to push his finger into her pucker just the tip. I won't force you to pleasure me, Yuriko." He stated lightly, it was his way of atoning he had nothing to lose at this point. She may've felt he was hard beneath her, but he made no attempt to touch himself, nor have her touch him. * - Fri Nov 27 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "I do." He stated, wondering just how tight the hole was. Before he pushed a bit further in, to about half of his index finger if he was able to, holding it there for a while. "I'm willing to never do anything with you, Yuriko. If it'll prove something to you."* - Fri Nov 27 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "I'm not trying to prove anything,  No Ulterior motives. I won't degrade you, I won't use anything against you." He stated, before suddenly he aimed to push the rest of his finger into her, down to the knuckle. Feeling how tight her pucker was against his finger, he swallowed hard. But focused, he looked down at her as he spoke "After this time period, Everything will change." He started, wondering just how deep her hate for him went.* - Fri Nov 27 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as he almost painfully slow, began to remove his finger from her pucker. As he spoke "Mm, Just needed to get it out of my system, Yuriko." He spoke, as he added "You can sit on my lap, or beside me. Your decision." He spoke closing his eyes, as his hand gave her ass one final rub, before he spoke "You can kill me in my sleep, whenever you desired. I'm sure that thought went through your head a few times."* - Fri Nov 27 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head "That you can, so why did you agree to the time limit I suggested?" He asked curiously, closing his eyes, as he leaned against the wall. Taking a deep breath as his ears tuned in on her.* - Fri Nov 27 01:30:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: There was a conflict...but I know that if I didn't have emotions, I wouldn't have cared. - Fri Nov 27 01:32:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes, as he spoke "That's a good question." He replied, taking a deep breath.  "You are the key to my perfection, At least that's what I believe."* - Fri Nov 27 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Key.... - Fri Nov 27 02:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: The cause for your curiosity, was him. That he was trying to steal you, when you suggest I allow him to take you outside. - Fri Nov 27 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He was the cause of my curiousity being displayed, but it was always there....  - Fri Nov 27 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I just wished. - Fri Nov 27 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You named me a girl of a thousand questions for a reason. - Fri Nov 27 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You came to me. - Fri Nov 27 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I couldn't ask you... - Fri Nov 27 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You could ask me everything. If you wanted. - Fri Nov 27 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I couldn't ask you if an owner says he loves you if he really means it. - Fri Nov 27 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And if an owner enjoys negative emotions for yourself if that was a bad or a good thing. - Fri Nov 27 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Or that your owner demands you do something and take everything away from him... if that's right. - Fri Nov 27 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Maybe I was wrong about the entire situation. - Fri Nov 27 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You don't have normal emotions even. - Fri Nov 27 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I had to see what a human thought. - Fri Nov 27 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah, but that's the thing. - Fri Nov 27 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) kept his eyes closed, but he could feel her eyes on him as he spoke "I suppose it doesn't, because I did." He stated, with gentle sigh.  He took a deep breath, "If you hate me, that's fine. It makes things harder, and I'd prefer you didn't. But I can't go back in time, to spare him. I don't think I would have either way. Not in that moment."* - Fri Nov 27 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked down at the ground, and slowly he stood, before heading over to the door, he sat down with his back against it. Since the door was locked anyway, he didn't have to worry about it being opened as he spoke "I don't have a 'real me', I'm learning what feels right to me. I don't see the need to pretend, not now." He stated lightly. Looking towards her.* - Fri Nov 27 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Why did he go sit all the way over there? Maybe I upset him. - Fri Nov 27 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What feels the most right? - Fri Nov 27 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: That makes him killing the guard even worse. - Fri Nov 27 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Domination. - Fri Nov 27 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I like the feeling....Of complete and utter domination of my opponent. - Fri Nov 27 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But I also enjoy slow times. - Fri Nov 27 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Opponent.... - Fri Nov 27 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you view me as your opponent? - Fri Nov 27 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I do, at times. - Fri Nov 27 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I can never defeat. - Fri Nov 27 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: No matter how hard I try, or what tactics I use. - Fri Nov 27 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: That isn't -exactly- true...but I worry what he would do if he knew how to kill me. - Fri Nov 27 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If you could kill me. - Fri Nov 27 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Would you? - Fri Nov 27 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Or is it because you can't hurt me? - Fri Nov 27 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If you could hurt me... would you hurt me? - Fri Nov 27 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's because, I can't hurt you, I can't kill you. - Fri Nov 27 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'm so drawn to you. - Fri Nov 27 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: If I could die, could hurt... would you find me uninteresting? - Fri Nov 27 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Or not have me as your d--....pet... - Fri Nov 27 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If you, could die, and could hurt. I'm not sure, You'd be another human with Unique abilities. - Fri Nov 27 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Come closer, Yuriko. I won't bite. It was out of line, calling you my pet. - Fri Nov 27 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You're my doll. - Fri Nov 27 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: And why do you recant it now? - Fri Nov 27 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked towards Yuriko, as she sat in front of him."I suppose, It isn't bad. But, It's usually a term for those, that are lead around on a leash. I don't think you'd enjoy it." He stated lightly, as he spoke "I will not degrade you by calling you that, I've said that. I told you, that you were my doll once. And that's what you are." He paused, as he moved to bow his head as he spoke "Once again, I let anger get the better of me."* - Fri Nov 27 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head as he spoke "A pet only exists for the entertainment, and pleasure of their master." As he spoke "You'd feel ashamed, if I used every part of your body, for my pleasure, and led you around by a leash, wouldn't you?" He asked looking towards her.* - Fri Nov 27 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: It feels like he already does a lot of that... at least some of it figuratively. - Fri Nov 27 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, as he spoke "I want to make you an offer, that'll change the last one." He stated, as he aimed to move closer to her. Aiming to lift her legs, to rest her feet on his lap, and as such he'd aim to slowly begin rubbing one of them. He had almost forgotten she couldn't feel it.* - Fri Nov 27 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: -omit- - Fri Nov 27 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "Legs up." He stated, before patting his lap, as he aimed to say what he did, had she complied.* - Fri Nov 27 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) would slowly aim to gently massage one of her legs, knowing she couldn't feel the release in tension but she could feel the pressure. "I'd like....to start over, to try stuff differently with you." He stated, they had a while to go, so he figured he could try being what she desired for a while. "I'll try being the owner you desire, If you can be the girl I desire, and need by my side. We can work through this together."* - Fri Nov 27 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, "Yeah." He stated his hands moving against her ankles, and then to her feet. As he looked up to her, waiting for what she planned to say.* - Fri Nov 27 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What would happen...this is just me saying a what if.... not that I want it or that it is going to happen. What would you do if I didn't want to be your doll anymore? If I wanted to take back what is mine... - Fri Nov 27 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he closed his eyes, "This base, It's people, And me?" He asked her, before he added "If you took control, wanted not to be my doll? I'm not sure. "I'd probably, serve you to see how you did. And then made my decision after watching for a while." He admitted.* - Fri Nov 27 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: To let you continue, or Leave. - Fri Nov 27 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: That is what you'd do? - Fri Nov 27 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Leave? - Fri Nov 27 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Do you really believe in that? - Fri Nov 27 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: If you didn't need me. - Fri Nov 27 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Or would you try to take over me. - Fri Nov 27 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: -Make- me do what you wanted. - Fri Nov 27 04:08:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Would you? - Fri Nov 27 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'd want revenge, to hurt you probably. - Fri Nov 27 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But at the end of the day. - Fri Nov 27 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I know, I can't kill you, or hurt you So I'd like to say I'd think of a different way to protect my interests. - Fri Nov 27 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Such as? - Fri Nov 27 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Sucking it up, no matter how long it took. Playing the part. - Fri Nov 27 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Until an opening presented itself. - Fri Nov 27 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I see. - Fri Nov 27 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Is that the answer you desired? - Fri Nov 27 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: The only answer I ever desire is the truth. - Fri Nov 27 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And, what about my offer, Yuriko? - Fri Nov 27 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Which offer? - Fri Nov 27 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: From this point on, to strive to be the Owner you desire, and you to be the woman I desire. - Fri Nov 27 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: To work past this. - Fri Nov 27 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: We can try. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I agreed to giving you a month. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Course... - Fri Nov 27 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You could always just end up pretending.... - Fri Nov 27 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: A month isn't very young and then once that month is up you could change. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then a year. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Let's head back to our room. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ..okay. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: A year is no different - Fri Nov 27 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He could pretend forever if he needed to...he said so himself. - Fri Nov 27 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stood as he'd aim to lift her up in his arms, as he'd begin walking towards the room that they shared. He wondered if she was dirty, so he took a quick glance at her body, as he'd enter the room with her in his arms. "I was thinking, I still have something I owed you."* - Fri Nov 27 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved to lay her down on the bed, as he spoke "I had promised, to make it up to you...For being so forceful at the beach. I know you can't feel more than pressure, But...I'd like to keep to my word...IF you're fine with that." He'd state, as he'd begin undoing his shirt, followed by his pants. As he'd sit at the edge of the bed by her feet, looking up to her.* - Fri Nov 27 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head as he spoke "I know that. But....What would you like in return...For me to do to make this up to you?" He asked, though he kept his underwear on, he wasn't sure what to do for her since she couldn't feel anything, that was problematic. She was right when she said anything sexual would only be for his benefit, but he wondered if there was anything she desired.* - Fri Nov 27 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her and he himself relaxed on the bed as she sat up. 

"I've never had to deal with this before, I don't understand much about why it hurts you so much." He stated with a sigh.* - Fri Nov 27 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Because you took away any opportunity for me to learn from him.s - Fri Nov 27 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: You took away that I might one day care about him. - Fri Nov 27 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You took away that I might one day care about him. - Fri Nov 27 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Fri Nov 27 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: You took away that he had an emotion no one else has ever shown me and it was so calming and I wanted that emotion and he was the only one who had it. - Fri Nov 27 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I understand a bit more now, - Fri Nov 27 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) approached Yuriko had she not killed him in his sleep. "Good Morning, I was thinking we could go water the Seeds. If you're up to it."* - Fri Nov 27 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked that had actually surprised him, but he smiled warmly. And aimed to pull her to her feet if she was sitting. Then he'd turn and proceed to lead her to their garden. Upon entering the door it was locked behind them, and he headed over to the corner of the room releasing her hand if permitted he'd begin filling two watering cans. Once one was filled he offered it to her.

"Tell me, Did you name them?"* - Fri Nov 27 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, finishing his own can. As he joined her, in watering the plants. Taking his time for each one,he crouched, down making sure not to step on any of them.  "We can plant more whenever you want." He stated, seemingly trying to go with this good guy thing for a while longer.* - Fri Nov 27 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated that for a moment, as he spoke "I was thinking, we could train for a bit. Then I'd take a bath or something, and we can begin working on your experiments if you want." He stated with a nod of the head, his wasn't perfect, he just did what he felt was about right, which probably left some plants over or under watered. He looked at her, looking into her eyes for a moment, before he stood, and moved to set his water can off to the side, and reached for hers to do the same. "Although, if you wish to do something, we can fit it in there."* - Fri Nov 27 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated what she said, as he took a deep breath as he spoke "That sounds fine, would you like to postpone the Experiments and the training to another day then?" He asked curiously. Turning to face her as he held her hand.* - Fri Nov 27 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head, "That sounds good then, Is there anything you want before we go outside? A snack maybe?" He asked, looking towards her.* - Fri Nov 27 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) (*Thirteen nodded his head, "That sounds good then, Is there anything you want before we go outside? A snack maybe?" He asked, looking towards her.*)* - Fri Nov 27 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I figured you'd want to train outside, was I wrong? - Fri Nov 27 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: But I was wondering if you wanted something to eat fist. - Fri Nov 27 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: First* - Fri Nov 27 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh. - Fri Nov 27 19:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No, I'm not hungry. - Fri Nov 27 19:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see. - Fri Nov 27 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Well, first I'd like to show you this stance. - Fri Nov 27 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Think you're willing to learn? - Fri Nov 27 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Of course. - Fri Nov 27 19:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head as he spoke "Watch closely." Taking a deep breath, he'd slowly enter a firm stance. His legs spaced equally apart.  His right fist balled and was raised, and his left palm, remained back. His fingers extended "This stance helps keep your movements fluid. Your attacks stronger, and with more precision." He stated, as his fist was thrown forward, aimed at the air before him. Before he took a deep breath, and sighed. Immediately his stance shifted, and his leg was thrown towards the sky, before bent and bought back down. He even threw in a few practice punches for her to see.* - Fri Nov 27 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) shook his head, "Continue like that." He stated with a nod of his head, taking a seat on the floor. He took a deep breath and inhaled, followed by a exhale.Watching her practice he said nothing, he wasn't the most defensive so it wouldn't be wise for him to get hit afterall.* - Fri Nov 27 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched her as he took a deep breath, and nodded. "You're getting the hang of it, try stringing attacks together." He stated watching her progress, it was definately interesting. Heels and a dress, He wondered if they even inhibited her in anyway like it would a normal girl.* - Fri Nov 27 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) carefully watched her, and when he felt like she had a firm grasp he spoke "That's enough." He nodded his head, as he spoke "That's great. You're a pretty fast learner,  Yuriko." He stated, standing as he aimed to walk closer to her. He clapped subtly as he smiled at her.* - Fri Nov 27 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) noticed her pink panties, and coughed, as his gaze shifted to the side. Before looking up to her as he spoke "I was debating what to teach you next, But I figured it'd be interesting to pace it so we don't run out fast." He looked at her as he spoke "Or do you still want to continue?" He asked, watching her expression carefully.* - Fri Nov 27 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled warmly up to her, as he stood, offering her his hand as he spoke "Then we'll learn something new tomorrow, Yuriko." Had she taken his hand, he'd slowly lead her to their room. As he spoke "I wish to take a bath." He stated, he figured it'd be ideal to do so before, the scientists got here, and before they left.* - Fri Nov 27 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) listened to the sound her her heels against the ground, as he closed the door behind them.  As he asked "Will you be joining me?" He knew she probably didn't care and she didn't get sweaty or all to dirty so she wouldn't need to but he had decided to ask her anyway.* - Fri Nov 27 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) also motioned for her to sit on the bed.* - Fri Nov 27 20:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head,  as she asked the question. "But it's alright, relax do what you wish until I return." He stated, before he'd begin undressing. His clothes were placed at a pile at the foot of the bed. And he grabbed a towel, and began heading into the bathroom.* - Fri Nov 27 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) had been taking his time, washing, even going as far as to wash his hair which he rarely did. After he did he'd speak "Yuriko, could you find me something to wear?" He asked, standing up, out of the water allowing it to drip from his form. As he reached for his towel, wrapping it around his waist. Heading out of the bathroom, he wondered if she'd do it.* - Fri Nov 27 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as he walked through, and looked at it. "I like it." He stated, as he leaned forward to give her a kiss on the cheek, while one hand moved to rub her head as a master may do a pet. Finally he'd reach for the clothes with the other hand. "Thank you beautiful, You're the best." He stated, sliding past her. He then began drying off, as he yawned subtly. * - Fri Nov 27 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) (*Thirteen smiled as he walked through, and looked at it. "I like it."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) would finish drying off, and slowly he'd move to put on the new clothes she had given him. Definately wasn't his usual attire but he didn't mind,  "I've never been off the island."* - Fri Nov 27 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her "In a bit." He stated, running to the door,  he called for them. Before moving to sit down on the bed beside her.* - Fri Nov 27 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Fri Nov 27 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) after a moment the scientists would've arrived in the room with a few different liquids. Approaching Yuriko, they'd roll over a tray, "Are you Ready, Lady Yuriko?" They said, starting with the first of them, which was in fact happiness the one that kept failing. "First one up!" She stated, with a smile.* - Fri Nov 27 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked as he saw her hand melting, "D-Do Something!" He shouted, and immediately the scientists, reached for a clear colored vial. Which was an anti-serum, they had prepared it as per Thirteen's request, luckily. It'd have it's time to shine, if it'd work, as he spoke "Take a deep breath." He spoke in a calm tone, as another vial was ushered to her, "D-Drink!" The Scientist stated, hoping it'd sate the effects.* - Fri Nov 27 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked "F-Fuck..." He stated, unsure of what he should actually do,  but he wondered if maybe that one was a dud. They aimed to pour another anti-serum into her mouth, hoping it'd stop the effects. He was actually -panicing-, he wasn't sure what was happening at this point.* - Fri Nov 27 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) (*Thirteen blinked "F-Fuck..." He stated, unsure of what he should actually do,  but he wondered if maybe that one was a dud.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at Yuriko, and he sighed, he had absolutely no clue, as he motioned for her to give the next one.. Praying that she'd be fine. "Come on...Come on...Come on..." He muttered.* - Fri Nov 27 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) sighed, as she seemed to be unconcious, and slowly he'd move beside her on the bed. Aiming to move her head to his lap, he'd gently stroke her hair. Motioning for the scientist to head out, he'd wait for her to awaken,  and then call the scientist back. (Assuming Tetsumi didn't respond.)* - Fri Nov 27 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was a bit perplexed, by this as he stared down at her "Had she died?" He wondered to himself, now that was interesting. She had mentioned that when she received large injuries or  'died' , She'd be unconcious for hours at a time. But he was patient, and this was a learning experience.* - Fri Nov 27 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ran his hand through her hair once again, before he spoke "Welcome back, Sleeping beauty." Interesting comparison to a novel he had red when he was younger. He stared at her, into her eyes. "How do you feel?"* - Fri Nov 27 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Bad. - Fri Nov 27 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I see, Do you wish to rest then? Or continue? - Fri Nov 27 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm not sure. - Fri Nov 27 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then....Let's continue. - Fri Nov 27 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'm sure that was a faulty batch. - Fri Nov 27 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'll have them keep a few Vials of the anti-serum on hand. - Fri Nov 27 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Can I stay laying down? - Fri Nov 27 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Yeah. - Fri Nov 27 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You're fine. - Fri Nov 27 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: As long as you want. - Fri Nov 27 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: It's not like she can choke afterall. - Fri Nov 27 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Okay. - Fri Nov 27 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) would slowly call for the scientist again, who came with a full bag with the vials of the serum. Along with a replacement injection, though she didn't reach for it. She offered Yuriko, but noticing her state, she'd raise it to her lips before attempting to pour it into her mouth as she laid down. This one was to imitate a mild frustration in the girl. He didn't really care about which emotions that were used.* - Fri Nov 27 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) sighed briefly, it seemed a lot was failing today, but the next one was offered to her. It was to simulate an effect which was a branch of fight or flight. Which would cause a desire to dominate, or control. To give her a desire to want to be in control, much like Thirteen.* - Fri Nov 27 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) gave her the next which was the polar opposite, which would make her submissive in nature, instead of dominant. He relaxed and continued to stroke her hair, wondering if anything would come to fruitation.* - Fri Nov 27 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, he wasn't sure what this one was. But he was happy, there was something present besides the usual hate. It was good for a change of pace, and slowly, his hand moved to rub her head again, as he spoke "How do you feel?" Meanwhile the scientist, had begun to prepare to give Yuriko another, but waited for her reply to Thirteen's question, before giving her one that'd simulate love. They were working at a faster pace now. One might wonder why?* - Fri Nov 27 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked "She's like a pet...."He stated, with his smile broadening as he spoke "That's good, Yuriko. Why don't you drink the next one?" He asked, the scientist offered her the one for love without any further hesitation. Placing it against her lips waiting for her to drink it.* - Fri Nov 27 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ran his hand through her hair, "I really do, love looking into your eyes." He spoke in a soft tone, as he stared into them. These were pretty interesting effects, and he wasn't sure what the scientist had planned firing these emotions rapid fire. But the next one was offered to her 'insecurity'. "Drink up, Lady Yuriko~." The female scientist stated.* - Fri Nov 27 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: you keep stacking - Fri Nov 27 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked, followed by a brief biting of his lower lip as she kept rubbing her face against his lap repeatedly. "W-Why does what h-hurt, Yuriko?" He asked, motioning for the scientist to prepare the anti-serum in case it got out of hand. He continued combing his fingers through her hair, as if to comfort her.* - Fri Nov 27 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked, as he spoke  "It's alright, Yuriko. I'm here for you." He stated, before his arms wrapped around her, aiming to hug her lightly. And with care, that a friend, or lover may've done. While one hand continued running it's fingers through her hair. "Listen to my voice, Yuriko. It'll be alright, It'll pass soon." He wondered if he could talk her through it. * - Fri Nov 27 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) did just that, and relaxed, just holding her and running his fingers through her hair. "It'll be alright, Yuriko." He knew it was also part of his job to care for the wellbeing of his Doll, so this was part of his job description.  Once it had passed, they'd begin prepping the next one which was: "Jealousy."* - Fri Nov 27 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled, as he spoke "Aren't you beautiful, My precious Yuriko. Why don't you give me a kiss~?" He asked her, as his hand combed through her hair he didn't notice anything, he probably wouldn't at all. He did begin to look like most people, kind and nice, caring. He was either acting really well or becomming something he hated.* - Fri Nov 27 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked, as she sat up. And he swallowed hard, as she kissed him, feeling her hand running across his cheek and into his hair. His eyes widened out of surprise, and the random sensations and feelings he was experiencing in this moment. But after a moment, his eyes relaxed before closing, this kiss was definately something different. He liked it, a lot.* - Fri Nov 27 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) his eyes were locked onto hers, when she broke the kiss his breathing was a tad bit heavier. And he had a subtle look of longing for more, she may've even noticed that his cheeks even had a faint red highlight, something that has never happened previously. He was practically speechless, and the scientists cleaned her fogging glasses. "Y....Yuriko..."* - Fri Nov 27 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) almost subconciously muttered "That was...amazing." He stated, as his eyes drifted down to her wet lips, and he instinctively went over his own with his tongue as if he had just seen the choice cut. His hand slowly moved around her, to rest on her back, He wasn't surhe wanted to mess up what they had right here and now. By adding another experiment, but going off on a limb he nodded at the scientist. "Just one more, Alright?" He asked staring into her eyes. The scientist began to offer up another one, the final one of tonight.  Pride.* - Fri Nov 27 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked as he could see it in her eyes, he took a deep breath before nodding to the scientists. Dismissing them. As his gaze found Yuriko, "I really do love that look in your eyes." He stated, as his gaze settled upon her, his hand on her back, moved up and down with slow motions.* - Fri Nov 27 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled, at her words. As his hand slowly drifted down her back, now resting against her lower back. "Mm, That's good, because I don't intend to stop any time soon." He stated, his hand moving the remainder of the way onto her butt, with a light squeeze, as he looked up to her assuming she was now sitting on his lap.* - Fri Nov 27 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, and he bit his bottom lip his hand gently moving along her curve. "I can't get enough of you, Yuriko." He stated, as he aimed to lay down upon the bed, motioning for her to sit down atop of him.  His gaze would watch her, he was really, loving this new set of emotions...A lot. He wanted to see just how far it'd go.* - Fri Nov 27 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) as she straddled him, his eyes shifted between her legs, taking notice of her panties once again. He wondered what made her wear underclothes, his gaze followed her hands as they moved to his shoulders and collarbone. He looked up into her eyes, as his hands found her thighs, lightly they moved over them. Tilting his had to the side, he kissed her left arm. His hands moving alongside her hips, before before both hands found her butt and he squeezed as he spoke:

"I think, this must be a small fragment of heaven I have before my eyes." He spoke, from the books he read, It was supposed to be a good place.* - Fri Nov 27 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked he was expecting such a teasing statement, feeling her hips against his hands. He swallowed hard, as he offered a subtle grin as he asked "Are you telling me you're bad~?" He asked, staring into her eyes, if he didn't know better he'd say she was pretty human now. Especially after that laugh.* - Fri Nov 27 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) stared into her eyes as he spoke "Mm, that you are, even when you're mad, You're still my perfect precious doll, I couldn't ask for anyone better~." He stated, as he looked at he pouting face, "Now what, oh what, Can I do to reward such a good girl~?" He asked her, giving her ass a small swat with his hand.* - Sat Nov 28 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) bit his bottom lip, as she moved against him, feeling her soft cheek against his own, and hearing that whisper of hers. His heart began to race, as he spoke "Mm~, I should get to that then, shouldn't I~?" He stated, as one hand shifted  higher, up to her side. Before he aimed, to shift their weight, and switch their positions, with him atop of her,looking down into her eyes.  He'd lean forwar to place his lips, against her collarbone with a light kiss, before his tongue ran across it and up her neck. * - Sat Nov 28 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled, as he spoke "I'm going to take you somewhere, in a month.....That I think you'll love." He stated, moving his face closer to her own, as he spoke "To meet something....Special." He stated, staring into her eyes. * - Sat Nov 28 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) his hand gave her ass another rough squeeze as he spoke "Mhm~I could tell you more...But where's the fun in that, Love~?" He asked, he wondered if she'd really like it at all. It was something he'd never have thought of originally, not unless he had met Yuriko.* - Sat Nov 28 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled as he spoke "I mean, kissing me, and moving your hips like that atop of me, is definately a good way to be good." He spoke, running his tongue across his lips, he was...definately enjoying this new Yuriko.* - Sat Nov 28 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes as she rubbed her hips into him more, she'd no doubt feel the pressure of his cock hardening against her rear through his pants. He gasped subtly, as she planted her lips against his own, he rubbed her ass lightly with his right hand, before giving it a swat. He didn't see what one night could hurt, they'd get back to their regularly scheduled program after this. His left hand found her thigh, and moved up it, running across her stomach, than her breast, before finding it's way to the base of her neck where it rested for a moment before falling back down.* - Sat Nov 28 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her hypnotized by her seductive gaze, he felt his heart rapidly beating. He was enjoying this show of hers perhaps maybe to much, it could show in his eyes he wanted to go further. His hand moved up her neck, before resting on her cheek, assuming she was still kissing him he'd aim to work his tongue into her mouth, as he gently carressed her cheek.* - Sat Nov 28 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) ----Realised he misread so bad,|| "Yuriko.....Take...your panties off.....And my pants." He stated watching her face,his hand moved from her cheek. And fell to his side as his other hand moved from her ass. Giving her room to do as he stated. His gaze moved over her dress, down to her heels, and something in his mind told him, this would be more interesting and exciting if she was clothed. He wondered if she'd take charge.* - Sat Nov 28 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked towards her as he spoke "I want you to continue, rubbing my penis....In every way you know....And when you decide it's time...I want you to take off my underwear. And I want you....To take me inside of you." He stated watching her face, it was truly a miracle he was able to say all of that without having his voice crack as she pulled down his pants, there still was a faint blush on his cheeks. He looked towards her freshly removed panties, and took a deep breath as his gaze found her once again. "Take your time...We have all the time we'll need, Though...I like when you tease~." He joked.* - Sat Nov 28 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) released a subtly gasp, as she rubbed along his length. It was rapidly hardening against her hand, as he spoke "I've never done it before...So I'm trusting you, Yuriko. It's because I truly love, and adore my doll, I put my faith in you." He stated, as he looked towards her. Though it was hard to focus, between subtle gasps from the pleasure she was bringing him even though it was small.* - Sat Nov 28 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes as she massaged him through his boxers, simply enjoying the subtle sensation. But when she pulled down his boxers, his cock stood to attention. His eyes opened to look up at her, as her hand coiled around his length, he swallowed hard. He felt his body tensing up from anticipation, he watched her lowering herself. But he thought she'd gradually ease herself onto him. Boy was he wrong, when she took him into her slit his eyes widened in surprise, not just because of how sudden it occured, but with the foreign pleasure which had enveloped him. The feeling of her soft inner walls was almost overpowering, as he released a moan of pleasure........His cheeks now fully red, he was speechless. His eyes were half closed and his mouth hung slightly agape. "C-Continue...."He muttered under his breath, though his voice was unsure, probably an innocence and nervousness she'd previously never heard. The pleasure and excitement could easily be heard, along with his embarrassment. This horde of emotions striking him all at once.* - Sat Nov 28 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) his jaw trembled ever so subtly when she began to rise, before falling taking him back into him at the slow pace. He was awestricken, never before had he experienced something like this, but when she picked up the pace. He began to gasp and moan, feeling her holding onto his body, as she rode him. The beautiful friction, from her tight inner walls around his cock, was sending him over the edge. Already he had began leaking a steady flow of pre-cum, making exit and entry that much smoother. He enjoyed the feeling of her lips against his body, and especially enjoyed it when her lips found his own. Shocked hearing her own moan, his cock began throbbing within her a gentle pulsation that became faster as she rode him relentlessly.* - Sat Nov 28 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt his orgasm building, as she rode him, and his hands aimed to wrap around her back, holding her against his own body. As she rode him, "Y-Yuriko!" He moaned out, as his cock violently throbbed within her pussy, and he came...Hard. Shooting his seed deep into her,  his eyes widened as he reached his orgasm...It was much different than anything he had ever experienced before, and it felt almost like it rocked his entire body. As she rode atop of him, he rode out his on orgasm. Once all was said and done, his hold upon her had lightened, his breathing was labored. And a thin veil of sweat appeared across his body.* - Sat Nov 28 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes, as he spoke "Y-Yuriko...." He called her name, as he felt her trembling against his chest, but he didn't think much into it, as his hand found her back. He truly, did love his doll in this moment as he opened his mouth he spoke the words. "I....love you." Though like most of the things he said, it was questionable which form of the word he used, and what it's meaning was to him. As he held her, tightly, embracing her form against his own. * - Sat Nov 28 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) just continued, holding her, gently in his arms. He knew, he probably wouldn't hear her repeat those words to him. Not as her master, after what he did. It might've hurt, if he was thinking normally but he wasn't. "I'm sorry....for it all, Yuriko...No..Ume...For everything....I've wronged you so much." He stated, his hold on her only tightened, although he wasn't that strong it'd probably go unnoticed.  "You...may never forgive me,I accept that...But I'm truly sorry. I was wrong...about so much." And honestly,those words, sounded the most sincere, out of everything he's said. Maybe this drained state made it easier, for him, he might've been changing...Just maybe, and in his fatigue it slipped through the cracks just a bit more...He let down his guard with her.* - Sat Nov 28 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) eyes widened as she spoke, his hands fell from around her, and his gaze drifted towards the ceiling. Almost as if he had seen something horrible, but he did...He had seen the truth in her words. He was trying to figure out who he was, using Yuriko as a catalyst. And she knew it, long before she revelaed it to him, he was stunned....Maybe he was just...Such a good liar, he convinced himself he was always telling the truth. He didn't understand, himself. His face was that of horror, and confusion. As he opened his mouth, it was unsure, afraid, that of a child.

"Yuriko...Who...am I?"

Maybe...He was mimicking Yuriko and in the process, he had lost himself.* - Sat Nov 28 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) raised a hand to his head, as if he had a headache as he spoke "Yuriko....Speak your mind...around me...From now until the end of time."He couldn't believe himself...Not at all.* - Sat Nov 28 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nods his head "That was a rash decision, and made in the heat of the moment. I will not censor your speech."* - Sat Nov 28 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as he spoke "Then you have my permission to slap me and call my stupid." He stated, although it seemed like a joke he seemed dead serious.* - Sat Nov 28 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ... Yeah but you know how you can be. - Sat Nov 28 03:06:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What if you are your other type of self...and you enjoy it? - Sat Nov 28 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Then at least... - Sat Nov 28 03:11:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah! - Sat Nov 28 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled gently as he spoke "I suppose....We've both learned something today." He stated with a light chuckle, more so at her enthusiasm and happiness to have learned something.* - Sat Nov 28 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What did you learn? - Sat Nov 28 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: That I'm more human that I originally thought. - Sat Nov 28 03:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) turned upon hearing staggering, probably caused by that of the shoes. He blinked, as he stood. "Yuriko..? Are you alright?" He asked, approached her, standing in front of her.* - Sat Nov 28 16:20:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) resisted, the urge to in fact laugh, as he spoke "Mm, Is that so~? What did you do that made you a bad girl, Yuriko?" He had a face that stated, he was aiming to be serious, but holding back some laughter. Because he realised the situation could be 'worse' than he thought.* - Sat Nov 28 16:27:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was practically, stunned, "I was asking---" He paused, as she continued stumbling around in his grasp and shaking her head. Sending her hair inro a mix-matched storm,  "Kumogakure?" He repeated, followed by the word "Friends?" He paused "Hmmm?" He asked, only to be taken by surprise, as she wrapped her arms around him, and he felt her soft cheek rubbing against his own, and his neck. "I can see that." He stated with a gentle chuckle, as she hugged him his own arms wrapped around her back as he spoke "Mm, But you were a bad girl. You didn't tell me anything, I was worried.~." He stated, putting on a fake drunken state. He was truly, taken by surprise that she could get drunk. And that got him thinking, he didn't actually mind a lot, he was slightly upset. But he realised it wasn't right for him to prohibit her from doing those things, It was great for her learning. And the information she relayed back helped him learn.* - Sat Nov 28 16:36:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: When the other person left I left to come home because I thought maybe she might try to steal my hugs again! - Sat Nov 28 16:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, as he spoke "Mm, You really pushed her off of you?" He asked, as his hand found her head, rubbing it gently. "That's a good girl." He stated, smiling warmly, down at her. "That was a good decision, She seemed like a weird person. I'm glad you made the good decision to come home, Yuriko." He stated with a smile as he spoke "Maybe we should let you sit down before you trip." He stated as he aimed to listen to her talking as he lifted her up, man did her light weight make him seem strong. He was proud he could left her up. 

"What else happened? Did you see anything cool? Any interesting animals or plants?" * - Sat Nov 28 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Mngng. - Sat Nov 28 16:43:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: That was funny. - Sat Nov 28 16:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her as she mentioned another person as he spoke "A loan, is when you take money with the intention of paying it back." He explained, enjoying her  nuzzling against his palm, and against his chest. He was happy the male had opted to take it as a loan instead of taking advantage of her, he looked at her as he spoke "Cold..? Mountains? People watching?" He repeated,  those were all things for the most part he didn't experience.."Snow...? What does it look like?" He asked,  she was really pushing a lot into his head "It was funny someone called you crazy?" He asked with a light laugh, as he entered the room kicking the door shut with his foot, as he moved to lay her down on the bed with her legs hanging off. 

"Sounds like you enjoyed yourself~."* - Sat Nov 28 16:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled a bit it was enjoyable to see her in this state, but he took a knee at the side of the bed and when she laid down. He'd slowly move to grab one of her legs, before gently taking her heel off, giving her foot a light kiss, before he removed the next shoe and repeated the process. His eyes drifted up to where her dress had ended, and he swallowed hard. He listened to her words, and he nodded his head. He'd very much like to see snow up close, as he moved to stand, and sit beside her on the bed. "I'm glad, I like these emotions you're showing. And it seems like you're blending in more and more, are you happy with them?"* - Sat Nov 28 17:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: So Zeno you're about to head out? - Sat Nov 28 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: -mischan- - Sat Nov 28 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) contemplated it, he nodded his head. "I see, I believe in you though, Yuriko. Though, maybe we can figure a way to make it 'easier' for you." He stated, as his hand moved to her head, and his fingers combed through her hair. "Do you still feel shame, around me, Yuriko?" He asked curiously, as he gazed into her eyes.  She was interesting, and he enjoyed learning about her, and how she was adapting with her emotions.* - Sat Nov 28 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) moved in closer, as he transitioned into a laying position as he felt her rubbing against his hand. "I see,  I'm glad you had fun.  I was thinking we could head to Amegakure later." He stated, he was trying to give time for people to awaken and what not, "Mm, you can use me for a pillow if you want~." He stated, referring to how they laid on the beach.  His eyes trailed subtly down her body, looking at her dress and too her stockings. It seemed her fashion sense was developing.* - Sat Nov 28 17:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Can you do things you do to a doll that you haven't done before?* - Sat Nov 28 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, as he focused in on her as she spoke,  and a subtle grin appeared upon his face. "Mm, Things I haven't done before~?" He asked as he moved to sit up, catching that mischievious look in her eyes. As he spoke "Mm~? Whatever do you mean, Yuriko?" He felt two could play this game, even though she probably played it better than he did.* - Sat Nov 28 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) tongue trailed over his lips, at some of the thoughts swirling through his mind. He did have quite a few ideas, he wanted to try out. Slowly he moved, to shift his hand over to the strap of her dress as he spoke. "I did mention...I was considering having you wear something special for me, didn't I..~?" He spoke, aiming to pull the strap off her shoulder. And when the first shoulder was exposed, he'd lean to plant a subtle kiss upon it, before aiming to reveal the second one, before pulling the dress down her body, before it was completely off. Though if there was a zipper, he'd take that method as well. He wondered to what extent was she wearing underclothes, if it was only panties, or maybe a bra as well.* - Sat Nov 28 17:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, as he spoke "Mm, You read my mind." He stated, as he planted his lips on her shoulder, before slowly and passionately kissing down her right arm. He'd aim to raise her hand, as he kissed the back of her palm, before the tip of her metal finger, his right hand reached around her. Aiming to unclip her bra, before pulling it off of her body he'd allow it to fall to the floor. Before gently he planted a kiss on her chest, and his tongue was extended giving her her left nipple a gentle lick, as he took his time, moving down her body. Planting a kiss on her stomach, as he moved down. He loved, the pink color of her panties and bra, he felt it suited this persona greatly. "I can never get enough of how soft you are, Yuriko."* - Sat Nov 28 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) smiled briefly, as he spoke "It's arousing, You do feel quite good against my tongue." He stated, as he first moved to remove her stocking, pulling them off her feet. Before he planted his lips against her left foot, and kissed, followed by her ankle. Then up her leg, until he found himself at her crotch, and his fingers curled around the band of her pantiess, and began slowly pulling them down to expose her sex. His tongue was extended, and it ran across where her clit was. He knew it served no purpose to her, but it served to arouse him even if she couldn't feel it the act was exciting. Something had been catching his attention lately, he wondered if her could embarrass her by catching her off guard. "But...before I get to dressing you up~." He stated, as he moved to flip her over onto her stomach. "There's something, I've wanted to do for a while now~." He stated.* - Sat Nov 28 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) blinked at her reccomendation, as he followed the subtle swaying of her ass in front of his face,he felt himself growing almost painfully hard within his pants. As he stated at her ass, "Mm, That's an interesting idea~." He stated, as his hands moved to either ass cheek, attempting to spread them, as he looked at her pucker, and her sex. He spoke in a low tone, "When, I look at your body, I get a strong urge, to touch....I want to feel, you against my body. To taste you, even though I know I can't...It's like having the fruit...before my eyes, yet not being able to take a bite...It's like a giant tease, that brings me in, It makes my heart race.~" He stated, as he leaned forward, his tongue tracing along her slit, before circling around her entrance. After a moment, he  aimed to push his tongue into her, exploring her inner walls. For the briefest of moments, "It's like, I'm being denied, the sweetest of fruits, even though I can smell it's scent, and see it."* - Sat Nov 28 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt her jump as his tongue entered her, That definately surprised him. And caused a faint reddening of his cheeks. He heard her speak, but now he was enjoying these reactions, as he pulled back momentarily. His gaze shifted to her ass as a hole, admiring her beauty, the detail, everything he was seeing seemed to fit together in perfect harmony. He had never seen a pussy, or ass so beautiful...Perfect before. But then again, he had never seen either of them, but he was -sure-, her's was something else entirely. His eyes drifted to her pucker, as he spoke "Knowing every....part of you,  is free to explore...I wish to know your depths...The way you work, an adventure into foreign territory, blinded by only the fierce desire, and lust for knowledge...For touch...The desire for something more, an adventure." He stated, as his tongue circled around her backdoor, the tip ever so gently brushing across her entrance. "A journey into the unknown." He stated, aiming to push the tip of his tongue into her.* - Sat Nov 28 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) closed his eyes, briefly, as his hands lightly kneaded her ass as his tongue explored her asshole. Pushing in deeper as she spoke, his tongue circling around her inner walls. For a moment before he slowly pulled out, planting a small hiss on the hole, as he spoke "How so~?" He asked, his heart was racing, enjoying every moment of exploration. Every second of touch. Sitting up for a moment, he began to undo his own shirt, followed by his pants. He was feeling way to confined, and hot with his arousing this situation was to him. Once he was nude, he returned back to her butt, placing a kiss upon it, before leaning to the side, he placed a kiss on her hip, his warm and hard cock pressed against the back of her thigh.* - Sat Nov 28 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) watched her squirm as a result of his touches, and slowly he leaned forward, staring back into her eyes. That look in her eyes, made his heart tremble in excitement, her words, sounded like someone was playing a beautiful symphony, and he was the only one in the world able to hear such a beautiful sound. "That's something, we'll have to find out together, Yuriko." He stated, to her, as he sat up, after giving her ass another kiss. He sat up straight, and his hand found her leg, attempting to raise it, upwards. Spreading her legs, as he spoke "You're something special, Yuriko, irreplaceable to me. Don't fight them, Yuriko, I'll be your anchor. Just allow your emotions to flow...To be free. Embrace it." He spoke, as his gaze settled upon hers, as he aimed to raise he leg to his shoulder, which would probably force her onto her side. As he pressed the tip of his cock against her slit.* - Sat Nov 28 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) eyes widened out of surprise, he hadn't heard her use those words before. But the way they sounded...Lewd...Using context clues, he had ascertained their meaning, and it was some sort of weird pleasure. Hearing her talk like that, especially with that innocent voice. "Y-Yeah." He spoke, his stutter showed the  surprise of her expanded vocabulary. As he supported her leg against his body, as he began to push into her, taking it slow. He bit down on his bottom lip, as his heart raced. He stared, down at her, as he suddenly bucked his hips forward. Aiming to drive his entire cock into her pussy, which resulted in a small moan of pleasure escaping his lips.* - Sat Nov 28 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) gasped as she moved forward, along with his movements. From the initial thrust, he looked towards her as he spoke "T-This feeling....Of being connected to you..Inside of you...Feeling your walls...around my...my 'cock', ." He paused and his gaze shifted off to the side, as his cheeks pinkened just a bit, as he pulled back out. Before thrusting in,  "I-It's like...a bit of heaven, It feels....amazing..." He stated, as he began slowly pulling back, and going back in. Keeping up a smooth and steady pace, with each thrust back in, he made sure to bottom out inside of her. He moaned out, as his cheek rested against the leg he was supporting. This tightness, was an entirely new feeling, and when he heard her gasp, and felt her tremble, it only added to his own arousal.* - Sat Nov 28 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) heard her moan out, and his movements began to increase in intensity. His cock began to release a bit of pre-cum into her. "A-All of those things! I enjoy, seeing that look in your eyes, the stuttering in your voice." He paused as he himself released another moan, mixed with a gasp. As he leaned forward, he knew she couldn't be hurt. So he leaned forward, causing her legs to rise up more, his hand reached forward, to grasp her breast. "I -love-, feeling you tremble. I want to hear you scream, screaming the name of your master. Saying all the lewd things that come to mind~" He stated, as his cock began pulsating within her depths. His breathing began a bit more labored signaling the approaching of his orgasm.* - Sat Nov 28 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) was following his system of  moving in and out of her. As his finish was rapidly approaching,  He saw her gaze raise up to him,  and her lips parted as she said those words. His eyes widened in surprise, and in that moment. The world, had dissappeared, as he drove himself all the way into her, bottoming out. As he stared at her almost in disbelief, his cock twitched within her. As he came, finishing within her. Although he did feel an immense amount of pleasure from his finish...That wasn't wear the vast majority came from at the last second. Her words had sent him over the edge. He couldn't believe them, he...never thought he'd earn the right to hear those words. But that look on her face, told him that it wasn't a spur of the moment thing...Did she even have those? He wasn't sure. But he spoke "Y-Yuriko....I...love you too." He stated, as his orgasm had run it's course, his breathing was heavier, and his heart raced. He stared down at her, not bothering to pull out it didn't matter at this point anyway. But he leaned forward, and aimed to plant his lips upon hers.* - Sat Nov 28 20:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) felt her lean into the kiss, and he closed his eyes, relying solely on the sensation of his mouth against her own. As he kissed her,  he aimed to work his tongue into her mouth. Embracing the moment they were having his chest, raised and lowered. as she was practically taking his breath away. He wondered if this was what love was, this influx of emotions that was overpowering him. He wondered if this started off as a lie, that he was believing his own lie. Or maybe..Just maybe this was how he actually felt.* - Sat Nov 28 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) for a second he forgot he needed to breath, so when he started feeling light headed he broke the kiss, panting and taking deep breaths to fill his lungs with air. "Yuriko..." He stated, staring into her eyes, as he slowly backed up. Pulling out of her,  before he fell to her side, laying on his back, as he extended his arm for her to move closer. He was speechless, taking deep breaths.* - Sat Nov 28 20:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) wrapped his arm around her shoulders, hugging her in a gentle manner, as he limbs rested over his body and her head on his shoulder. He closed his eyes subtly as he tilted his head to rest it against her own. "I never did, get my cup of coffee this morning." He muttered, definately off topic but that was the first non-sex related thing that popped into his mind. Quite an odd and funny thing to say at this time.* - Sat Nov 28 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her, as he spoke "Sure, only if you shake your hips on the way there." He stated, leaning to give her a kiss on the forehead, as he smiled warmly towards her. These slow times...He could survive.* - Sat Nov 28 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Uh... - Sat Nov 28 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: H-how? - Sat Nov 28 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) almost fainted by the sudden "When you sway your hips from side to side, ---But don't worry about that, Ther'll be a lot of time for you to find out later~." He stated, as he slowly rolled off the bed, he figured he needed to get dressed, As much as he'd love to sit here naked with her all day they had stuff to do after he got his coffee.* - Sat Nov 28 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) laughed subtly "That's great, Yuriko." He stated, "You can stop~." He spoke, picking up her panties, he'd offer them to her. Followed by the rest of her clothes, as he took his coffee. "Get dressed~." He stated lightly, before blowing his coffee. And taking a sip, he headed to the door.* - Sat Nov 28 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) leaned in and whispered "If you want, you can leave the panties off, It'll be out secret~."* - Sat Nov 28 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) took her hand and led her out.* - Sat Nov 28 21:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Yes. - Sat Nov 28 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Can Yori have a hug? - Sat Nov 28 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) whispers: Not a special one, a normal one is fine. - Sat Nov 28 21:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) nodded his head at Yori's words, and slowly he moved to sit upon the desk to his left, raising his glass of coffee he didn't seem to disturbed.* - Sat Nov 28 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: . . .What the fuck happened when I was gone. . - Sat Nov 28 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thirteen(Jjking217) looked at her and sighed briefly, but it was a happy sigh.  "So Yori, tell us what you've learned and seen on your travels?"* - Sat Nov 28 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Well, I've learned several new techniques, in a village called Kumogakure no Sato. - Sat Nov 28 21:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Yeah. - Sat Nov 28 21:46:27 2015
