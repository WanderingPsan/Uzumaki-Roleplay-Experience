He was also reading a book which he set down when she approached.* - Thu Oct 22 02:26:20 2015

"So what would you reccomend? What would you say is 'my' color?" He asked curiously.* - Thu Oct 22 02:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's that time of night, Where I will do a single request, for the Hell of it. - Thu Oct 22 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Kay. - Thu Oct 22 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her foot prod against his hand, and he laughed lightly as he spoke "Your wish is my command~" He stated in a joking tone, as he moved to gently take one of her feet into his hands, and slowly he'd maneuver his thumbs against the sole of her foot. Slowly kneading with small circular motions as he looked up to her deciding what he should talk about next as he asked:

"So if you could make one law what would it be?" He'd ask lightly while he continued lightly massaging her foot.* - Thu Oct 22 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Depends. - Thu Oct 22 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Worldwide law? Suna-gakure law. . . - Thu Oct 22 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) had noticed the hiccup but didn't comment on it, he also noticed the curling f her toes, and took it as confirmation she was enjoying the massage. And slowly he opened his mouth. "Hm....Konoha." He stated curious as to what her response would be, as he continued lightly massaging her feet, before slowly his hand drifted lower, rotating her ankle lightly before his fingers began slowly working the flesh on the ball of her foot.

He briefly took notice of her drinking Sake, but like most things he didn't pay much more attention to it.* - Thu Oct 22 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: H-hhm. - Thu Oct 22 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure. - Thu Oct 22 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If it'll lead to less pretentious people being in my village, I'd likely have as few rules as possible. - Thu Oct 22 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Assault wouldn't be a crime unless permanent damage is done. - Thu Oct 22 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I feel like.... - Thu Oct 22 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It'd make the atmosphere similar to Kenryoku's. - Thu Oct 22 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No one spoke out unless they could back up their obnoxiousness with strength. - Thu Oct 22 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) added a bit more of pressure, since a lot of tension usually gathered at the ball of the foot as well as the heel and since he was working on the ball he was taking his time, finding the small stutters in her speech to be quite adorable, but he was excited she was enjoying it. After a moment, his hands transitioned to the heel of her foot, lightly kneading the flesh. As he spoke:

"I see, I wonder how that law would affect Konoha, But I'm sure it'd be for the better. Well...Ideaology not law."* - Thu Oct 22 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If it doesn't work out. . . - Thu Oct 22 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I could always change things around until everything's comfortable. - Thu Oct 22 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiled warmly at her words as he simply stated "I see I admire that, Looking for the solution which works the best. It's a skill most Kage lack...Most just go for the easiest, not the one that helps." He stated lightly, as his hands moved across her foot once again, this time his fingers slowly drifted to her toes, giving each individual toe, it's own mini-massage, before once he was done, he'd lightly pull on the five toes from that foot. Which was an act of relieving tension.

And with a slow and gentle motion he'd reach for her second one.* - Thu Oct 22 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I-I've been meaning to ask. - Thu Oct 22 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was under the impression that while he was weak, he was probably stronger than you. - Thu Oct 22 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was slowly beginning to work on her second foot, but the moment she popped that question...He stopped abruptly...Just staring her her foot, mostly because if it wasn't there, he'd be staring at the ground like all people who brood do. He took a deep breath, followed by an exhale..As he spoke:

"He was definately...Stronger than me...But it was something that had to be done...Strategy and caution. As well as knowing my opponent saved my life.." He stated lightly, returning to his duty of massaging her foot.* - Thu Oct 22 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ....Oh. - Thu Oct 22 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sorry. Forgot. - Thu Oct 22 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: That he was your friend. - Thu Oct 22 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) shook his head as he spoke "It's...Fine. I said I'd answer your questions truthfully." He stated lightly, as his hands began working her heel being gentle, as to not hurt her. He didn't go fast, and took his time, occasionally he'd steal glances towards her.

"But..There was no way I should've came out of that battle alive. If there's a god, he or she definately protected my ass."* - Thu Oct 22 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Thu Oct 22 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You had help. - Thu Oct 22 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head as he spoke "Yeah, I did, From you, and a few others. I wouldn't have even...raised a Kunai if it wasn't for you few who mean something to me. I would've just submitted and let myself die, I was in a pretty dark place afterall...Which didn't improve until recently." He stated lightly, as he massaged the sole of her foot. Taking his time.* - Thu Oct 22 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well. Alright. - Thu Oct 22 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Although. - Thu Oct 22 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That sounded...Cliche. - Thu Oct 22 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And Shonen type. - Thu Oct 22 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after a few more moments of massaging her foot he released her foot resting it gently upon his lap as he spoke "And this my friend, concludes the Index Massage Q and A~ At least for today."* - Thu Oct 22 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would stand reaching for the bottle taking a sip he'd set it down. "Good night." He stated heading to his room, not caring much for leaving the door unlocked.* - Thu Oct 22 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hey, Lera-sensei. - Thu Oct 22 19:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nudges her with his elbow.* - Thu Oct 22 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her heel rammed down against the toe of his own boot, and he felt it. And it definately, hurt, as he pulled his leg up in a recoil of sorts. The sudden motion caused him to lose his footing and fall onto his rear, in which he slowly rubbed his foot through his boot. "O-Ouch, W-What was that for?" He asked looking to her. The pain causing his foot to throbb for a bit in pain, as he began to recover, he actually began to laugh.* - Thu Oct 22 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Man but isn't that a surprise. - Thu Oct 22 23:28:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Not afraid, I just realised, I was going at getting to know you the wrong way. - Thu Oct 22 23:36:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Everything we're both willing to tell. - Thu Oct 22 23:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yeah. You hide things. - Thu Oct 22 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: If you ask the right questions, I won't lie to you. - Thu Oct 22 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: That's the one thing I will never do. - Thu Oct 22 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: So. - Thu Oct 22 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: If I asked if you want to head to a Hot sorings would you say yes? - Thu Oct 22 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I....guess, we could do that. Yeah. - Thu Oct 22 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Well, If you don't want to, I could take you to dinner, and we can talk more about your crush. - Thu Oct 22 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Hmmm. - Fri Oct 23 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I think we're past dinner. Let's do the hot springs. - Fri Oct 23 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Sounds good, Lead the way. - Fri Oct 23 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as they went home, he also went to change his clothes, and he ran a single hand through his hair as he yawned to himself. Just a bit of tiredness which had wormed it's way into his body. But as they arrived at the hot springs he took notice of the Yukata Katsune wore. And his eyes were averted subtly.

He averted his gaze as she stripped, because he believed that was the most...Polite thing to do. And slowly he began to do the same, removing his Jacket, followed by undershirt, and Pants. As well as his boots, all was placed together in a pile off to the side.

He examined her Bikini, and a faint reddening of his own cheeks could be detected, but he said nothing as he approached the edge of the water, crouching down. He tested the water after she did. But he used his hands.

"Just as hot as usual."

She may notice on his chest, there was a tattoo which took the shape of twin dragon's coiling around eachother.* - Fri Oct 23 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after a moment he followed behind her and slowly  dipped his leg in without the neccessary preparation. "H-Hot.." He muttered under his breath, as he slipped into the water, taking a deep breath as he let out a low gasp feeling the heat surround his body, after a moment he felt himself getting used to the water. And relaxed besides Katsune as he muttered:

"I needed this.." 

He let out a sigh of relief.* - Fri Oct 23 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have....an important question for you Index. - Fri Oct 23 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked a bit as she scooted closer to him, his gaze meets hers for a moment. Before he looked forward, taking a deep breath to steady his nerves he asked "W-What's it?" He wasn't sure honestly what to expect. His left hand was raised and a single finger used to scratch his cheek. * - Fri Oct 23 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And I asked you to. . . - Fri Oct 23 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Would you stop working for all of the villages at once? - Fri Oct 23 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) closed his eyes, as he took a deep breath. This wasn't a question he had expected, nor one he had a prepared answer for. It was a simple question loaded with so much. He visibly tensed for a moment. And he kept repeating the question mentally as he spoke:

"Would I stop...If you asked?"

He thought about it once again, He considered her a friend, and he hoped for her success, but if she asked him...What would he do? After a few moments more of contemplation he simply stated:

"I wouldn't mind, stopping if you asked me to."

He scratched his cheek for a bit as he looked away from her a tad, perplexed, by her reasoning for asking this question. But there was more than one reason which drew him to his answer.* - Fri Oct 23 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm trying to decide...whether or not to teach you more jutsus. - Fri Oct 23 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see.. - Fri Oct 23 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But, as for Konoha...Did you plan on doing it soon? - Fri Oct 23 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm still deciding. - Fri Oct 23 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way I'm not happy right now. - Fri Oct 23 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So i'll do 'something.' I just don't know what. - Fri Oct 23 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Not happy.. - Fri Oct 23 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Fri Oct 23 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I suspect...that I can kill anyone that isn't Baen or Hassan right now. - Fri Oct 23 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And Hassan's an ally. - Fri Oct 23 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I might be ready for Konoha. - Fri Oct 23 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't know. - Fri Oct 23 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But are you ready...For the responsibility? - Fri Oct 23 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Of course. All work and no play is all I do. - Fri Oct 23 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'd like to believe. - Fri Oct 23 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Some play is neccessary. - Fri Oct 23 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was dumb enough to come to the hot springs with you. . . . - Fri Oct 23 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) laughed a bit as he spoke "I don't know about it being dumb, But even if it is...I'm happy you did." He stated lightly, closing his eyes as he relaxed beside Katsune. "You're one of the few people, I can enjoy my time with." He admitted lightly.* - Fri Oct 23 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) swallowed hard, as he felt her hip, and side meet his own.  His eye opening for a minute looking towards her, before he closed his eye again. He felt his heart racing, as his blush became more pronounced.

"I su-suppose you're right...B-But that makes y-you wonder right? W-Why are they s-so popular?"* - Fri Oct 23 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Did I seriously...Just stutter? - Fri Oct 23 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: The Hell is wrong with me? - Fri Oct 23 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think. . . . - Fri Oct 23 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Most people come in groups of more than two, and that's why. - Fri Oct 23 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her arm wrapping around his own. He didn't resist, but he opened his eyes curious as to what was occuring, but as the gesture was completed, with his hand resting against her butt, his blush intensified greatly. And he felt his heart skip a beat.  Listening to her words, as he felt her hand rest atop of the back of his own. He swallowed hard, staring towards the water before him. "I-I...s-suppose y-you're right..." He was a bit perplexed, and stunned he wasn't honestly sure what he should say in this moment.* - Fri Oct 23 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But. . . . - Fri Oct 23 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: B-But? - Fri Oct 23 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think. . . - Fri Oct 23 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We keep having these awkward dates, because you're waiting for it to be official. - Fri Oct 23 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) once again felt as if his heart had stopped beating as she spoke, maybe he forgot to breath, or maybe time had frozen in this moment as his ears registered what it is Katsune had stated. And part of him second guessed himself, not believing what his ears had just heard. With a single motion, he turned to look at her, as best as he could without being uncomfortable, or jerking his body away from her.

"R-R....Really?" He muttered, in disbelief. Still in a state of flabbergast.* - Fri Oct 23 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) as the realisation set in, with the confirmation by her nod. He felt his heart suddenly flutter, as excitement ran across his face, he was happy... Maybe happiness wasn't the correct word for what he was feeling, but a smile rose across his face. Not to say he wasn't still....Extremely nervous, he simply spoke:

"Kat...I'm not sure what else to say....R-Right now...So I'm j-just going to say t-thank you.."* - Fri Oct 23 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) in hindisght would probably be happy to realise she ignored that comment of his and slowly, he'd attempt to turn his hand which currently rested against her butt. He did move over only a tiny bit, as to not make her uncomfortable by pressing down as he did the transition. But he'd attempt to take her hand in his own as he thought to himself:

"I'm...Happy I came here today, even if I'm doomed to embark on the quest known as awkward silence...At least it's with Kat."* - Fri Oct 23 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Although. . . . - Fri Oct 23 01:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There are gonna be a lot of awkward silences in our relationship. - Fri Oct 23 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I didn't talk about my work...Because I wasn't sure how you felt about it. - Fri Oct 23 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But...I'll promise you this.. - Fri Oct 23 01:39:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you never blatantly lie, no one can blame you. Right? - Fri Oct 23 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I won't say that. - Fri Oct 23 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But I won't lie to the one's I care about. - Fri Oct 23 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But you hide things. - Fri Oct 23 01:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I have to ask, those won't be very exciting conversations. - Fri Oct 23 01:43:15 2015
