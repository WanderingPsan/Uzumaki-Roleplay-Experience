<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: So, To train yourself in Wind training. .We will start with something simple. - Tue Oct 20 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath and sighed to himself finding this to be a fairly interesting process, as he relaxed on the ground he took one of the leaves which were no doubt dried out, but he didn't comment upon it so he took a deep breath, his breathing was focused, and he closed his eyes concentrating on the leaf which was held tween' his palms. Slowly he felt the texture of the wind against his fingertips. Enjoying the sensation, it was rough, yet at the same token it was fairly smooth, wasn't bad. He understood this was going to be a long process but he shrugged it off.

Slowly he began to gather his chakra, taking subtle breaths, as he steadied his breathing. He felt the cool desert breeze rush over his body, he tried to focus ont he sensation of wind, envisioning the calm, but fierce breeze. He definately enjoyed the process of training and sought to see it through to the end. He was definately troubled, but that was fine, it was nothing he couldn't work through if time permitted itself. He sighed lightly, knowing this was going to be a painful process.

But even so he figured he'd give it his all, as his eyes remained closed, he focused. Attempting to gather his chakra, he didn't seem to mind it at all. But he continued focusing realising how easy Marissa made it seem, but he surely had a lot more training ahead of him if he wanted to be able to wield this element freely as if it was one of his own, he definately had a one up over almost everyone else, since he was gifted with a few elemental affinities.

But he recognized that learning this would give him that total coverage he desired, which made him happy, so he continued gathering his chakra, beginning to allow it to flow, and slowly he allowed it to propagate around his palm. Concentrating he kept it there, as he inhaled sharply, followed by a deep exhale, he smiled a bit before he took another deep breath, his hands covering that of the leaf from sight. As he focused, aiming to mould his chakra into that of a wind affinity.

And as such, his chakra suddenly spiked, and chakra was fired in between his palms, the chakra overtaking the leaf,  as he continued to focus. Aiming to replicate the effects which had been seen by Marissa, and as such, his chakra in fact split the leaf, he relaxed on the ground, showing his results to Marissa, as he yawned lightly it was truly an interesting process, but he had a lot to do if he was to gain power in this short amount of time, so he had to pick up on lost time, and that was exactly what he intended to do.* - Wed Oct 21 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) reached for the scroll and nodded his head as he watched her demonstration, he nodded his head once again. Understanding the example she had just showed him he slowly unraveled the scroll deciding it was as good a time as any to begin reading this scroll, the first thing that caught him was honestly the single seal, which would allow for quick and easy execution in the midst of battle, that made him happy.

He took a deep breath and sighed as he slowly began to trace his finger along the scroll finding his place in the scroll as he prepared to read "The user releases a gust of wind that forms several small tornadoes.  Combined with Fire Release: Running Fire that forms a circle on ground level, this creates a massive flaming hurricane." Once he had succeeded in reading the small passage he slowly put the scroll down.

He felt like he had a pretty firm grasp on the technique at hand and as such when he stood hands were raised to chest level, and slowly he began to practice the seal, raising his hands to chest level, he moulded the single seal which would be needed for that of the technique, creating the seal before he relaxed his hands a pretty easy process he didn't mind it's reptitive action.* - Wed Oct 21 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You are doing great Index! You are getting ahold of this very quickly. I only have C rank jutsu to teach from here on. . So it's going to be a little tougher. - Wed Oct 21 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's fine I have time. - Wed Oct 21 00:21:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I am, if you are. - Wed Oct 21 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: alright - Wed Oct 21 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath and sighed it seemed like he was being tossed right back into the fray so he braced himself. Taking a deep breath, as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale. His eyes focused on what was going on, Gale palm was definately a technique which seemed to favor the more interesting side of techniques, but he believed to accomplish what it was she said he'd have to time his technique perfectly, but that was definately able to be worked on.

He smiled, before looking at his scroll, he noticed the task which was before him, and he realised it'd definately take some work, but he looked at the scroll, running his hand along it's side, he smiled warmly befor he began unraveling the scroll, trailing his finger along the words he found the line which started the text off and decided it would be  agood place for him to begin his studies, so he inhaled followed by a deep exhale as he read:

"A simple technique that when the users hands are clapped together, wind is compressed and transformed into a powerful gale.  This technique, when used as an isolated attack has the power to easily knock over a human. "This part was definately interesting allowing for numerous possibilities had he been given the chance he'd be able to accomplish a wide variety of techniques and the works.

Slowly he continued reading."Though the true value comes from using it together with projectile weapons like shuriken or kunai.  Their speed, power, and ability to wound or even kill are all increased several times." After reading this passage, he smiled warmly taking a deep breath, as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, beginning to gather his chakra he stared before him, with a gentle smile.

His hands were raised, as chakra began to accumulate between them, before he clapped his hands together, sending his chakra outwards in one large gale wind, which shot across the ground blowing up sand, he turned to Marrisa and smiled briefly, nodding his head, he found this fairly interesting to say the least, he seemed to be a fast learner, which was definately really good.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I threw in Shadow Shuriken. . It's a pretty basic Shuriken jutsu. . but I figured it would go well with the launching weaons motif I was pushing there. . heh - Wed Oct 21 00:46:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Wed Oct 21 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he relaxed on the ground decided he'd first take a deep breath and start with the first scroll she had set out for him, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he looked at the first scroll which was labled  "Chakra Flow Wind." He smiled warmly, as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale as he sighed to himself, he had already known of chakra flow Fire and he assumed wind would be very similar.

So cracking his knuckles, he smiled warmly as he decided to give it a shot, reaching into his pocket he pulled out a small knife, which he held in his grasp, unraveling the scroll with the other hand he began to slowly read"By flowing chakra over their weapon this user increases the sharpness of bladed weapons."

Just that small portion had already piqued his interest so he decided to focus more and read it more thoroughly."So much so that in the hands of an experienced user even small blades are capable of piercing substantial rocks easily, leading to his assertion that this chakra is unparalleled offensively in close and mid-ranged fights." After reading that paragraph he yawned subtly relaxing on the ground.

He noticed he only had one paragraph left so he had decided it'd be best to knock it out so taking a deep breath he found his position and prepared to read. "This effect is achieved by utilising two opposing chakra currents, which are ground against each other in such a manner that they sharpen one another into fine pieces."

Slowly he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he channeled his chakra into the blade, and immediately it ignited with wind which flowed around it increasing it's sharpness and it's length he smiled warmly as he spoke: "Thank you, Marrisa...You don't know how much this means to me...But I think I'll call it a day...I'll show you my progress in the morning though."* - Wed Oct 21 00:56:19 2015

He asked lightly looking away as a faint blush befell his face.* - Wed Oct 21 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked away for a moment, before stepping forward he attempted to wrap his arms around her and give her a warm hug resting his cheek on the shoulder-plate of her armor, after a moment he'd release her and prepare to scurry off if permitted.* - Wed Oct 21 01:09:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked he honestly wasn't expecting her to change into it so easily, and he did find her clothing definately befitting of her. As he moved to take a seat beside her, he yawned lightly before placing the drink on the table. He looked towards her and asked "Which game are you in the mood for~?"* - Wed Oct 21 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as he watched her downing alcohol, and a part of him, held back a laugh since he guessed she'd be needing large amounts to play this game. But honestly, he wondered if he was too far behind her. But he nodded, since he wasn't able to finish the last game, he decided that'd be ideal for this time to try.

"We'll play the last Game. 1-Article of Clothing 2-Drink, 3-4 Dare, 5-Truth, and Six Payment of One Hundred Thousand." He stated. 

"I guess I'll start us off~" And as such he rolled the dice forward.* - Wed Oct 21 01:33:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he slowly unraveled his scroll inhaling followed by a deep exhale he began to slowly read the scroll deciding that this technique was painfully similar to that of gale palm, but he noticed there definately was a few variations. They intrigued him greatly and as such he was happy that this technique would be a fairly easy one to master. 

Tracing his finger along the page, he slowly began to read "This is a relatively simple technique that creates a sudden gust of wind, but its scale varies greatly depending on the user. If used by a superior shinobi, it has enough destructive power to knock down a large tree."After reading that part, he scratched his cheek as he nodded his head he figured this would definately be proficient in battle.

As he continued to read, he sighed to himself, he figured this would be an easy learn, he already noticed an increase in his ability as a Elementalist and smiled. He was making serious progress."The wind from the squall can blow away all things in the user's line of sight. A variation of the technique involves a smaller blast of wind which gets ignited with flame."

But standing his hands were raised to chest level, as he smiled. His hands moving together as he formulated a single handseal, followed by inhaling followed by a deep exhale, he was definately excited that this would help improve him greatly, it was only a matter of time before he was able to use the wind element of his own accord.

But slowly he realised that he had only a bit more to go and had decided to ultimately give it his all with one final push, he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he smiled, watching the dust which was raised as a result of his technique, he cracked his knuckles and sighed, he was done with this technique and it was onto the next.* - Wed Oct 21 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sighed to himself as he cracked his knuckles, he definately needed to make progress he'd noticed his own lack of strength for a while now. And he definately found this interesting and sighed aloud, as he reclined on the ground. Running a single hand through his hair, as he yawned to himself, opening the next scroll, he decided to focus once again, as he looked forward, he partially wondered.

But slowly he began to unravel his scroll, and he inhaled followed by a deep exhale. Slowly he began to look at the scroll, looking at the bindings followed by carefully unraveling the scroll, he felt the texture of the paper against his exposed fingertips. Feeling the coldness of the paper. He slowly sighed hoping this would prove to be easy.

But he smiled to himself, he figured it was always a good read when he could learn something from it. He yawned to himself, as he cracked his knuckles,  and slowly he debated if this was actually worth the trouble of reading it and he felt as if it did, he smiled to himself and yawned to himself, as he smiled he decided it was well time to begin reading.

And slowly he began tracing his finger along the page before he found out what it was he needed to learn and slowly he began reading "This technique shoots multiple bullets of air at the victim with intense speed. The bullets also have great power, enough to subdue a whole group of shinobi." After he had finished reading that surprisingly short passage he had decided to try something or rather try the technique.

After he had finished learning the technique he took a deep breath and sighed, as he relaxed on the ground once again, he only had one more technique to learn, and damn was he feeling good about his knowledge thus far. He had made a lot of process and as such he was excited.* - Wed Oct 21 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) sighed and this was definately a bit of a hassle, and he inhaled followed by a brief exhale, as he raised the scrolls to his eyes as he began to read "This technique infuses wind-natured chakra into bladed weapons. The user can then manipulate the blades in a spinning manner to attack the target. " After having finished he took a deep breath and sighed this was a hassle he didn't want to deal with.

But he took a deep breath, as he smiled warmly, and slowly he decided to begin practicing the chakra flow, as he inhaled followed by a deep breath. As he yawned to himself, as his hand moved through his hair he yawned to himself, and hoped he had a firm grasp on it.* - Wed Oct 21 20:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) listened to Asteroth's words, and was surprised to feel her hand resting atop of his hair. His eyes widened in surprise, and a faint reddening of his cheeks was apparent. He stared at his feet for a moment, he wished...He was older...He wished he was stronger, but as she asked about his darkness. She'd no doubt sense his hate, his pain, his desire to kill radiating off of him as pronounced as the budding of a flower. The colors radiant.

"I've seen....Everyone....I know died.....I killed...My brother.." He gazed down at his open palms, his hands curling into fists as he spoke. "With these hands...I've done...unimaginable things...." He stated, he seemed to almost tremble. But he simply looked towards Asteroth.."I'm broken...The toy no one picks in the store..." 

He paused.

"But do you know...What is is...I've learned...Through my experiences of pain?" He asked, his hands clenching into fists.* - Wed Oct 21 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her fingers moving through his hair,  almost unnaturally making his thoughts clear in this moment. As he simply stated: 

"I've learned...That pain is my ally, Pain let's you know when you're alive. Pain never betrays you, and never lets you down. Pain is Predictable, Pain is my friend."

He stated, he felt almost a throbbing sensation in his heart, like it threatened to stop. He felt his hate rising, and thoughts swirling through his mind, The Gezo, Kirigakure, Sunagakure...Everyone..The world. In this moment, he was comming to see how much he despised so much. He wanted to kill, his mind told him that was the way to ease this pain.

To make another experience it...It'd ease his own.* - Wed Oct 21 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked towards her as her hand fell from atop of his head,though he could still feel the lingering sensation of her touch. He heard her words, listening to them, almost feeding off of them. As he looked towards the sky briefly, he closed his eyes. Listening to her final remark, he took a seat beside Asteroth, resting beside her legs as she spoke. He asked:

"Of assistance...to me..?" He asked lightly, repeating her words.* - Wed Oct 21 23:23:44 2015
