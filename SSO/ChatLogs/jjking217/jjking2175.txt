<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at Hideki's clone and made a mental note of how it drained him, he took a deep breath and sighed. Cracking his knuckles as he focused upon his target and as such chakra gathered into his left palm, gathering into a flaming ball, which spewed through the gaps of his fingers, with a quick motion, his hand shot forward sending a ball of fire towards Hideki's clone,  aiming to strike the clone and attack on impact, meanwhile he skipped backwards simply observing his handiwork.* - Fri Oct 16 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he watched the clone continuing it's charge at him, and he took a deep breath before inhaling followed by a deep exhale. As he completed a single seal, a liquid flame of sorts began to seep from his mouth before aiming to cut off the clone's progression by making a barrier of flames barring travel along the surface of the ground leaving the water as a possible way to get to him. Meanwhile he continued backing up, hopefully his flames would obscure him from sight.* - Fri Oct 16 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiled as his plan had succeeded for the most part, inhaling followed by a deep exhale, as he lept backwards once more as the clone made it's way to the water. Hands raised, he made a serious of handseals before his hands touched the ground, lightning spewing from his finger tips, aiming at touching the water, and once it did he aimed to electrocute the clone, and potentially every other fish located within the water, he took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a deep exhale preparing to admire his handiwork, though he wasn't sure if it'd fail.* - Fri Oct 16 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath definately a lot more problematic than originally intended, and as such he lept backwards again, this time chakra gathered in both hands, and he shot them forward with lag in between. The first one aimed directly at the clone and the second aimed at the ground before it's feet aiming to trip him up , but he realised he was running out of backup space.* - Fri Oct 16 00:31:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looked at his hands and nodded "They're clean." He stated as he leaned forward, blushing slightly as he stared at her lips for a moment. Extending two fingers, he rubbed her lips with his fingers. His eyes averted lightly, before a moment passed and his hand was lowered back down to his lap, offering the dice to her.* - Fri Oct 16 01:55:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked as she put her gauntlets back on biting his bottom lip as he gasped when her metallic fingers clapsed down on his flesh. He's definately going to have a mark later. Either way, once she released the flesh felt like it was throbbing for a moment, and his leg was raised up and he rubbed his foot, "S-Shit that hurt..." He stated, once she finally released. Taking the dice--Assuming she gave them he'd proceed to toss them up.* - Fri Oct 16 01:59:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) swallowed hard as she placed her legs on his lap, his eyes found her stomach, before he leaned forward. Getting painfully close he stopped considering what he was doing "A-Am I...Actually...?" He thought to himself, before shrugging it off, before he moved to plant his lips against the fabric that covered her stomach. Planting a kiss there, which was held for a moment before he pulled back with a faint blush offering the dice back to her.* - Fri Oct 16 02:04:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) 's blush would become more pronounced as he examined her face for a moment, leaning forward he'd' look at her face, before his eyes trailed down to her chest, his hand resting on her leg. As he felt his heart racing a bit more, he swallowed heard, as he leaned in, placing his lips against the center of her chest, he closed his eyes, as he planted a kiss. More curious about her it'd feel rather than the kiss itself, but after a moment he pulled back, offering her the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 02:17:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) wasn't sure if he should thank the person who made these dice, but as he looked at her he swallowed hard once again, he was doing that....A lot, but he felt her tongue move against his neck, causing a gentle gasp to escape the confines of his lips, only to reach for the dice, and be punched in the nads, immediately erasing any arousal he had, "F-Fuck!" He declared, doubling over his hands finding his nadz, as he struggled to fight off the pain. "Note to self...Wear a cup the next time you come here."He thought to himself, and ultimately ended up rolling the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 02:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath she had no problem cutting his leg, so should he have a problem cutting her arm? He wasn't sure, but he did feel bad as he reached for a knife, lining it up with her bicep because of course he wasn't going to cut ar her wrist, or risk cutting an artery or vein. The knife was given a bit of pressure before pulled across, making a shallow cut, that would sting more than anything. Definately filling bad the knife was set aside and he offered her the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 02:27:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looks away briefly, parents did this for their children when they cut their fingers right? He wasn't sure. But slowly he extended his tongue and with momentary contact, he licked her arm, perhaps getting a taste of her blood. And his eyes were averted briefly, before he tried to make a joke perhaps in bad taste. "Your blood...Was delicious." An obvious vampire pun.* - Fri Oct 16 02:40:51 2015

He looked at her butt for a moment, and his blush became more pronounced, and he felt his heart racing---Honestly he never considered the possibility of this roll, he felt his body heating up. As he slowly leaned forward, his face inching closer to her butt, before finally, he pressed his lips against her butt.

Taking a moment as he kissed her butt, and he felt a problem growing. As he pulled back up his gaze was averted slightly, and his heart was still racing.  He didn't say anything but offered the dice to her.* - Fri Oct 16 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) watched as she turned around and felt the cold metallic fingers pinch down on his lips, and he closed his eyes tightly in pain. He had come to expect harsh pain when Katsune got such rolls so he simply accepted it though that didn't stop the pained grunt, as he took the dice...Rolling once again.* - Fri Oct 16 02:56:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) slowly extends his hand as he looked at her exposed stomach, and slowly his hand moved up and down, followed by a circular motion against her stomach before his hand was removed and he offered the dice to her as he spoke "Why don't we kick the penalty up a bit..? Make it two hundred thousand, and swap out one body part and action...Could make the game a lot more interesting." And he takes the hundred thousand.* - Fri Oct 16 03:04:44 2015

Though that didn't actually help his embarrassment, as he leaned forward once again staring at Katsune's breasts for a moment, before he moved to possibly sandwhich himself between them before placing a kiss on the center of her chest. Before leaning back on the couch,  as he relaxes on the couch the dice are offered back to Katsune, and his hand moves to cover his crotch.* - Fri Oct 16 03:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) felt her foot connect with his stomach and lurched forward,  gasping out even a weakened full force kick to the stomach, was still a kick to the stomach. but even so luckily he was drunk or rather on his way there, after a few moments of keeping everything down, he picked the dice up as they were tossed up.* - Fri Oct 16 03:44:00 2015

As he slowly leaned forward, closing his eyes, as he aimed to place a kiss upon the sole of her foot. Perhaps an odd place, but it was probably the alcohol  taking over, as he offered her the dice. His hand once again moved to cover his crotch. Covering up the problem which was growing by the moment.* - Fri Oct 16 03:56:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took his money, and blushed a tad, as he nodded his head, and turning on the couch, he turned his head away from her, he wanted to abide by her request. But part of him wondered why he had to turn around, maybe his brain wasn't making sense of the obviousness of the situation.* - Fri Oct 16 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) kept his head turned away, resisting the urge to turn as he felt the couch shaking behind him, but once he felt her sit back down followed by her word, he turned and first he noticed that she was being covered by a couch cushion before his eyes scanned the room eventually taking notice of the body suit laying where she put it. 

And eventually his mind came to the conclusion that she was naked, and immediately his eyes widened, followed by the deepening of his blush as he reached for the dice, rolling them, he hoped to maybe get his mind off of it, but even so the thought aroused him and as such one of his hands moved to cover his crotch as he rolled.* - Fri Oct 16 04:22:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) took a deep breath as he looks to Katsune after taking notice of the distance which seperated the two of them. He took a moment to observe her form, as he noticed her hands raised into that of a seal. He had enough trust in the woman not to honestly jump when she formed a seal, she had never given him any reason to doubt her. So he didn't and probably wouldn't he cracked his knuckles.

Listening to her description, he nodded his head since it seemed like the Snake seal would help him a lot in the learning of this technique along with it's practicing, he nodded his head, watching as she kneeled and her hands touched the dirt beneath her.

He observed how her gaze transitioned to her hands, and he nodded his head, following her lead he kneeled down. And made the seal in response to her words, and he inhaled followed by a deep exhale, listening to her description for the technique.

His hands slowly were raised to chest level, holding the seal, before his hands were moved to the dirt before him,chakra beginning to gather and flow around his hands, as he concentrated his chakra attempting to focus on accessing his earth affinity.

He noticed several similarities between this and voyage and definately found them both interesting techniques, he took a deep breath followed by an exhale. Watching as her arm moved into the earth, his eyes stayed focus on her motions for a moment or two, before seeing as she pulled her hand from the ground.

Looking at the clump of dirt she extracted, before his eyes met hers, and he nodded his head giving her the signal that he was paying attention. He took a deep breath once again, before listening to the rest of her explanation it was a pretty good one and he appreciated it. 

Finally he watched as she dusted off her hands and stood upright, and he nodded his head. Slowly his hands were moved together in an attempt to make a single seal, once he had said seal, he began channeling his earth related chakra, as his hands met the ground, he slowly began digging into the ground.

As his hands touched the ground his chakra coated his hands, and they effortlessly moved through the ground beneath him, as he slowly dug further into the ground, inhaling followed by a deep exhale, he took his time and focused not wishing to do more than he could handle.

Slowly his form began to descend further into the ground, before he was completely submerged taking notice and heeding her words of keeping the chakra around his person he took a deep breath and smiled to himself, before he slowly began to swim upwards.

Hands found the edges of the ground and he pulled himself upwards and out of the liquidified earth, running a hand through his hair to rid himself of any dirt residue which was left behind. And he stood, with a gentle smile he spoke "Thanks Kat." He looked truly happy to have learned this technique, and his mind was already working on great ways to use it in battle.* - Fri Oct 16 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Fri Oct 16 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looks at her as she approaches him and contemplated her question. "Hm..." He stated lightly. Before a single hand was rasied to his chin, he scratched it gently. "I've worked up quite the apetite. If you're willing to come with me." He stated lightly.* - Fri Oct 16 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. We could do that, I guess. - Fri Oct 16 23:40:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) was definately in one of those randomn spurts of happiness people had and as such he unintentionaly extended his arm to Katsune like one of those old-school gentlemen. "Shall we be off~?"* - Fri Oct 16 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) smiled a bit, he expected this reaction and he slowly followed her back to Sunagakure and possibly a Sushi-bar.* - Fri Oct 16 23:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) didn't decide to go to some upscale Sushi bar, If he was getting Sushi, he wanted to taste the love in it. So he found a small family owned Sushi bar, and entered holding the door open for Katsune, he looked around there was a bar-like counter, where one could sit and watch them prepare food.

"Want to eat there or at a table?" He asked lightly, observing her facial expression.* - Fri Oct 16 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Table. - Fri Oct 16 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head as he walked over to the table, and slowly he pulled out a chair for Katsune, assuming she sat down at this chair. He'd push it in, before finding a seat across from her passing one of the two menus her way.* - Fri Oct 16 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after he looked at the menu for a bit, he looked to Katsune as he spoke "I think, I'm going to try the Sake Nigiri." He stated, calling for that of the waitress to come over assuming Katsune had decided. He'd order Sake Nigiri, along with a bottle of sake.* - Fri Oct 16 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) ||After taking their orders the Waitress returns to the kitchen and begins preparation along with the chef.

"I never took you for a Sushi lover." He stated lightly, as the bottle of Sake was bought to the table, along with small glasses.

He proceeded to pour himself a glass, along with one for Katsune, he offered her one. * - Sat Oct 17 00:03:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) laughs a bit at her response, but he didn't say anytthing, as he took a deep breath and relaxed in his chair, enjoying himself a bit as he asked "Could I get a taste? I'll let you have one of mine." He stated lightly just a casual question he was fairly calm, at this point and time. And he casually took another sip of his drink.* - Sat Oct 17 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) would slowly nod his head, he wasn't sure if she was against people touching her food but he decided just in case, he'd use his fork, which was unused to stick it into his sushi, it was Salmon, and rice, with a Sea-weed binding, And a bit of a Sirachi sauce upon it. With his hand hovering beneath it, he leaned forward, offering it to her, though it seemed like he was offering to feed it to her.* - Sat Oct 17 00:25:36 2015

Just in time for the piece of sushi to hit his forehead, splattering whatever sauce it had contained all over his face, and it dripped down his chin and onto his shirt. The piece of Sushi seemed to stick to his face for a moment, before peeling away from his flesh, and hitting his lap, making an entirely new splatter of juices.

He sat there, with his eyes closed for a moment,  as the juices roll rolled down over his eye lids, some of them managed to get into his eyes, and he felt the burning of the sauce, "S-SSS-Shit!" He declare rubbing his eyes frantically as the spice worked, causing him to tear up some as his eyes turned red from the irritation.* - Sat Oct 17 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after frantically patting down the table, he searched for a napkin, and began patting down his eyes, rubbing them frantically with the napkin in an attempt to get the residue away from his eyes.

He stated jumping up,managing to open his eyes through tear soaked lens. "W-What do y-you mean being lame?" He spoke mixed with moans of pain.* - Sat Oct 17 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) after a few moments, the  pain died down a bit, though it was still there, it was somewhat bearable, taking another napkin, he wiped away his eyes a bit, but that didn't help he was a mess, soaked in water.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) while she was changing had decided a nice glass of water would've been nice so he filled himself a glass, just incase Katsune would've desired one he filled her one as well. Taking a seat on the couch he waited for her to finish changing, but once she came through the door. His jaw practically dropped, a deep blush covered his face.

He looked at Katsune in the mini-dress, and he was immediately taken by her beauty. His eyes moved from her feet, up to her face, taking in her entire person, before he muttered. "Wow..." He heard her speak and spoke:

"It's...It's fine, You look beautiful Kat." Though he figured it was fine since it was just them, after a moment of gawking, he reached for his glass of water, taking a sip of it.* - Sat Oct 17 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) looks at her as she approaches and sits on the couch, he swallowed hard, but he simply stated. "W-We can go and g-get you the r-right size later...If you want?" He stated lightly as he added. "It would be nice if you wore it more than once though." He noticed her reluctance to reach for the water, though he didn't understand why, he reached forward and grasped the glass for her, offering it to her. As he took another look at her, just as awestricken as his first look.* - Sat Oct 17 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Sat Oct 17 01:45:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It'd get in the way too. - Sat Oct 17 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) laughed a tad at her comments as he spoke "You're always in battle-mode aren't you~?" He joked, as he relaxed on the couch he spoke once again. "Every once and a while, I think you should let your guard down for a day or two, dress up and just have fun, even if you're by yourself, or with a friend." He stated lightly, he looked towards her and aimed to place a hand on her shoulder as he spoke:

"You should embrace the moments where you don't have to fight, even if you value the ones you do have to. These moments are fleeting, and becoming fewer and further in between." * - Sat Oct 17 01:50:04 2015

"I dare you to do ten pushups." Of course he had an ulterior motive, much unbeknownst to himself.* - Sat Oct 17 02:13:58 2015

He stated, intending to make her pay in full, as he entered the kitchen, getting the spoon, and the squeeze bottle of mayonaise, as he approached her standing up. As he slowly filled the spoon with mayonaise looking at it, he raised the sauce up to his lips, before he put it in his mouth, and immediately he gagged.

Somehow...Some way in hell. He managed to get through this, most of it without vomitting.....Before he spoke "I....I can't...I'll...Puke.." He stated, dropping to his knees in front of Katsune.* - Sat Oct 17 02:36:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) on that note, he runs over to the bathroom, and lets it all out. After a moment he comes out of the bathroom, cleaned up. And looking a little more alive, approaching the couch, he sat down beside her, "Truth or dare?"

But as he returned he even flashed Katsune his teeth before sitting down, they were in fact pearly white at this point, with a nice minty scent.* - Sat Oct 17 02:59:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) blinked in all honesty he was expecting her to refuse this dare, so as she sat on his lap, and wiggled into position causing his heart to race, as his embarrassment grew with the passing moment. Swallowing hard, he eventually looked at her back, before his gaze shifted off to the side, he took a deep breath before he said:

"Truth."* - Sat Oct 17 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: U-umm...... - Sat Oct 17 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What exactly are all of your elemental affinities? - Sat Oct 17 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) closed a single eye as she moved, suppressing a gasp as he heard her question. "E-Earth, Fire, Water and Lightning." He stated lightly.* - Sat Oct 17 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Kay. - Sat Oct 17 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Truth. - Sat Oct 17 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you have any rules for this place I should know? - Sat Oct 17 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. - Sat Oct 17 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't bring anyone over without my explicite permission in advance. - Sat Oct 17 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'In'....advance. - Sat Oct 17 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Got you.. - Sat Oct 17 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's all that I can think of. - Sat Oct 17 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Dare. - Sat Oct 17 03:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nods to the clone who went to go fetch the Mustard, a very unique dare, so once it returned to him. He felt like he had a better shot with mustard rather than mayonaise, so as the bottle was handed off to him it was raised to his lips, and slowly he began drinking the thick and bitter-tasting condiment. Filling his mouth with it, he'd then slowly swallow. Occasionally stopping to cough a bit, He wondered why she was so fixated on condiments but he didn't really care a bet was a bet.

After about Four to five minutes, he reached the final squirt of mustard, and as he swallowed he definately felt full...Overly so, he felt like tomorrow when he woke up he'd have a massive stomach ache and be sick, but for now he was fine. Maybe going over five minutes depending on the size of the bottle he'd ask:

"T-Truth or date?" His breath smelling of mustard.* - Sat Oct 17 03:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mmmm..... - Sat Oct 17 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Dare. But this is the last one. After this, I wanna go train or something. - Sat Oct 17 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Index(Jjking217) nodded his head as he looked to her and slowly he took a deep breath followed by a slow exhale. "Then...Could you hug me for a while while you sit here?" He asked, though his voice seemed riddled with embarrassment there was something else he desired to as but he didn't have the courage to do it, and ultimately his perversion took over and it resulted in that question. He agreed they probably needed training, but he took a deep breath and waited for her reply.* - Sat Oct 17 03:23:05 2015
