<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked at Asteroth as she entered the room, and his gaze shifted and met the ground. "Y-Yes....More...or less." He admitted.* - Wed Dec  2 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Good. What brings you here? Didn't anticipate you being so eager to work. - Wed Dec  2 22:46:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I need a person to show it off on. - Wed Dec  2 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked towards Asteroth briefly, as he spoke "I-I wanted to make use o-of my time t-to show you I was serious. M-M'lady." He stated, with a bow of his head, he had taken a knee before her, recognizing her as his commanding 'officer'.* - Wed Dec  2 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) contemplated what he was asked, "What...What kind of tests?" He asked, his gaze upon Asteroth's feet, because he was aiming to show 'respect'. In a way, though mostly because he was to nervous and embarrassed to look upwards.* - Wed Dec  2 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm? It doesn't have to be that significant, you know. - Wed Dec  2 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: But it's your choice, I'd suppose. - Wed Dec  2 23:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) felt the needle enter his wrist. And he felt the warm liquid, entering his blood stream. His vision blurred for a second, as he felt an intense burning moving through his legs, as he reached for the syringe. And aimed to pull it out before slamming it against the floor. He grunted out in pain, his legs hurt...A lot, they felt tense. That was definately problematic. He wasn't, in an ideal situation not currently at least. He sat on the ground, to relieve some of the pressure, but he could only wish, that this one decision hadn't messed up his career. Stunted his growth. He didn't say anything, but his face very visbly showed pain and discomfort.* - Wed Dec  2 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) narrowed his gaze upon Zenaki as she called him weak. And from where he held the syringe, a noticable spike in chakra which caused the glass tube to crack before minorly exploding in his grasp. Minor cuts on his hands, he said nothing as he raised his bleeding hand while still holding the glass as to not get any on the floor. He closed his eyes, and rested his head against the wall. "If...I...am not able...to return....to the way I was...I'm going to kill her...Taking my time...." He thought to himself.* - Wed Dec  2 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: Might just.... Concentrate on my poisons... And more jutsu's... Mmmhh..  - Wed Dec  2 23:45:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: I need to get a gasmask.. Soon..  - Wed Dec  2 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked up to Asteroth for a moment, before his gaze fell back down to the floor. "It hurts...A lot...I can manage..." He stated, feeling the sensation going through his legs, he bit his bottom lip. As he tried to push up, with a lot of difficulty he was standing. His legs ached, but he figured  he'd get accustomed to it...for the time being. * - Thu Dec  3 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Good. .  - Thu Dec  3 00:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) moved to the door, and aimed to push it in, he needed to get accustomed to this pain. So he walked with a slight limp.* - Thu Dec  3 00:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: .. - Thu Dec  3 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) debated on what he could do that'd be entertaining. But he lead her out "I had noticed a lake, Would you like to perhaps...Rest there and have some lunch...? Maybe a foot rub, or something of the sorts just to help you relax a bit...Before you go to study. They say you're more receptive that way.." He stated, his gaze fell off to the side.* - Thu Dec  3 00:17:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: This place.. - Thu Dec  3 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: D-Did I say something wrong..? - Thu Dec  3 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Not you. - Thu Dec  3 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: ... - Thu Dec  3 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded as he had begun to unseal a blanket from an extremely basic seal. Which he set out on the ground for Asteroth to sit upon, while it also unsealed bottles of water, and various juices, though there was a small bottle of sake. "M-Might any of these interest you? A-Asteroth-sama?" He asked, kneeling at her side on the grass, as he awaited direction or permission to commence the foot massage.* - Thu Dec  3 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head, as he looked down towards the closet leg to him, and moving forward, he'd aim to move closer, before lifting her leg to put it upon his lap.While he was sitting the pain in his legs had ceased so he aimed to slowly remove her shoe, he'd proceed to set it down on the ground his gaze settled on her bare foot and he developed a faint blush. This wasn't how he anticipated this day going. So as he held her foot, he'd slowly begin massaging the sole with his thumbs. He was a bit embarrassed, he had never anticipated touching Asteroth in such a manner but he tried to focus himself.* - Thu Dec  3 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) would've wondered who Index was, that was stealing his pride if he could've read minds. But as he slowly worked her foot, he was treating it, just as it was, elegant, and fragile. "M-Myself...? T-There isn't much to tell... I g-grew up in Kumogakure....But for about a month, I lived i-in this place called Shinkogakure with m-my brother...I m-made a friend...And had a s-sensei...But they both.." He paused, not speaking for a moment, and his hands stopped moving. "They...w-were killed.." His hatred mounted for a second, and he needed to take a moment to brace himself. But when he returned to massaging her foot, his motions were even more graceful, and gentle.  His motions shifted to her heel, taking his time as to not hurt her.* - Thu Dec  3 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked up to her briefly, as he spoke "Everyone left...Everyone else is dead." He stated, as his gaze returned to her foot, now moving to her individual toes. With a gentle pulling motion, which would relieve pent up stress in the joint. He'd slowly rest it down on his lap, before lifting the second and beginning to work on it. "So no...I-It's not still functioning.." He stated, listening to her humming it caused his blush to become more pronounced. Happy to be doing something of use for the woman.* - Thu Dec  3 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked up to Asteroth, as she spoke, and he bowed his head in thanks. Though mostly to hide how pronounced his blush was growing when she patted his cheek. "I-Index? I've...never heard of him." He stated, lightly nodding his head to giving her directions. His thumbs working on the ball of her foot, he was happy for the praise. And even more happy he was able to help her at all.* - Thu Dec  3 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked up to her as she stood, and moving to grab one of her shoes, he held it before her foot for her to slip herself into. "If y-you will Asteroth-sama.." He stated, looking down towards the ground. He was curious how much he really was like this...Index, that got killed by the Gezo.* - Thu Dec  3 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head and of couse directed the Caravan as needed to arrive at Shinkogakure. * - Thu Dec  3 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked at the Village, it was practically destroyed explosions riddled the place. Three graves could be seen near it's gate, and one decayed body of what looked like a randomn shinobi on the ground. Not a single soul was around, it was silent almost too silent.* - Thu Dec  3 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) felt her hand on his back, and he blinked, as he moved forward as she desired.* - Thu Dec  3 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) as he headed into the Village, he looked around "I doubt there's anyone here, Asteroth-sama..." He stated lightly having no problem leading the way for her.* - Thu Dec  3 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head as he led her around when she asked for him to lead her to their graves. He took notice of the eagerness in her voice. But he didn't pay it much mind, slowly he led her to a secluded area, where there were two graves one large. And one normal size, he looked at the graves. As they approached he said nothing but he took a deep breath, It did hurt him seeing their graves again. Especially when he wasn't the one to set them at rest. And his discomfort very much showed on his face, regret, anger, hate. Were all feelings manifesting within his body.* - Thu Dec  3 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) felt her hands upon his shoulders, as he stood before the graves of those he was to weak to protect. He was to slow to make it there in time, and that made it all the worse, that his legs had been crippled in such a way, he wasn't sure if he'd be able to proficiently run again. That hurt him greatly, as he listened to her speak, like a tiny devil in his ear. He felt himself drawn in by her words, as he spoke:

"Would...I be upset..? They're...My friends....It's my fault they're there...I...failed them." He spoke in a surprisingly calm tone. 

"I...think I'd...be mad if their graves were disturbed."* - Thu Dec  3 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked back towards Asteroth..."If...It'll help you Asteroth-sama...As long as they're buried again when she's done.." He stated, as he looked towards the grave sights,the shovels he had used to bury them were probably nearby. As he slowly picked up the shovel, he'd look towards her once again as if he wasn't sure, but he had placed faith in Asteroth. As he stuck dug the spade of the shovel into the dirt, he began digging the coffins up. For the three corpses, Was he so easily manipulated this was considered a good idea? Or perhaps was he so far gone, so full of hate.  His mind was clouded? Maybe he lacked a sense of morality.* - Thu Dec  3 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Maybe...They will maybe they won't either way...After all is said and done, I'll meet them eventually. - Thu Dec  3 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) finished digging up the bodies.* - Thu Dec  3 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) arrives at the house, with a knock upon the door. Assuming he was permitted to enter, since he worked for both women here. He'd do so noticing Zenaki he'd speak "Hello...Miss Claudette."* - Thu Dec  3 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked towards Zenaki, as he approached her assumably in the bathroom  he'd look towards the babies for a moment as he spoke "You know...When Asteroth-sama isn't here, Aside from experiments I'm your servant as well. So if you'd like, I could fix you something to eat when you're done or give you a foot rub, or whatever you desire." He stated with a subtle sigh.* - Thu Dec  3 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head as he walked into the room, looking for their sleeping wear. Once he'd located them, he'd enter the room where the babies resided. Starting with the girl, he'd crouch before her. Smiling subtly, as he reached to grasp her gently in his hands, and lift her before putting on her pyjamas. Followed by repeating the process for the boy, Though he wasn't sure what to do to calm the infant down so he didn't try. After they were both clothed, he'd move to approach Zenaki.* - Thu Dec  3 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Akari. It's fine.  - Thu Dec  3 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Just knock them out if they don't listen. They need to sleep soon anyways - Thu Dec  3 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) still took his time, with them, he didn't care much for the crying. But it wasn't like he was hurting them, so he'd work with them. He debated knocking them out, but he opted to just push their bodies into the clothes. Once was all said and done, he'd grasp both of them by the rear of their underclothes and carry them over to the cribs in which he'd lower them into their corresponding cribs to sleep.* - Thu Dec  3 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Miss Claudette. - Thu Dec  3 21:34:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) had started to believe it was well past time for him to begin engaging in training once again so as he sat on the ground he inhaled followed by a deep exhale. Reaching into his back pocket, he withdrew a scroll...It was the scroll Hatsujin had left him. And holding it bought up a lot of bad emotions for him. He bit his bottom lip, as he slowly unraveled the scroll and began to read what was listed within the scroll "Demonic Illusion: Descending Fireball Technique." He took a deep breath.

He braced himself for what was to come. And slowly he traced his fingers along the text of the scroll before finding the beginning of what was written and slowly he began to read "This technique causes the illusion of a tremendous ball of fire falling from the sky into a designated area. The targets involved in the illusion literaly feel the ball's hot temperature getting closer"

He took a deep breath and nodded his head, truly an interesting technique he was happy Hatsujin passed it down for him. So he took a deep breath and looked forward, he bit his bottom lip subtly. As his gaze settled on the text, Menma was an extroadinary learner. Faster than most, and it showed when he learned this technique like it was nothing he yawned and placed the scroll down. And ushered a silent prayer in thanks to Hatsujin.* - Fri Dec  4 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath he was moving on slowly he was excited in some manner he had the opportunity to advance his abilities with lightning some more thanks to his brother, he ought to be happy for the opportunity. So he took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a deep exhale, this was going to be an interesting ride. So taking a deep breath he slowly began to unravel the scroll before tracing his finger along the beginning of the page.

He read the name of his technique, and took a deep breath. He nodded his head, he figured this would be a fairly easy technique to learn on his part, as long as he put the effort out. And so he aimed to do just that, effort was what was required and effort was what he intended to put out. So he took a deep breath and sighed, he had quite a few things he wished to advance himself in afterall.

But he read through the scroll, in a fairly quick amount of time, and when the scroll was read. It was set down, he took a deep breath and sighed, before relaxing on the ground.  That was one of many scrolls that had been completed so he licked his lips, and relaxed. He needed to get his speed up, if he was to be a threat to anyone. But he also wondered if he should advance his swordsman anymore.* - Fri Dec  4 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath as he inhaled followed by a deep exhale. It seemed that on today's agenda, the forecast was training so he had to get to it and work. With a subtle yawn, he'd crack his knuckles, taking another deep breath as he grasped the hilt of his katana. And held it tightly within his grasp, as he took a deep breath he looked around and yawned to himselef, he was curious as to what would happen if the chance was to arrive.

But he needed to gather the strength neccessary to fight to advance, and get stronger. By any means neccessary, this was going to be a long day, and he took a deep breath and sighed, as he took a meditative stance upon the ground. Concentraing, he began to focus on what he'd be able to do, and as he sat there, he began to think of combinations with his techniques that would permit him ultimate freedom.

So he sat there and focused, concentrating on what was at hand.* - Fri Dec  4 01:11:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Well. I've enjoyed, although as you can see. My company was a bore. - Sun Dec  6 15:40:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: C-Coward? - Sun Dec  6 16:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath as he looked at Asteroth for a moment, before releasing the breath hoping to calm his nerves. Slowly he began to undo his shirt, before folding it and he crouched to begin untying his boots, followed by unbuckling his pants until he was in only his boxers. He was fairly toned, due to his excessive training with a sword.  He looked to Asteroth after piling everything up neatly, before he stepped forward, aiming to slowly slide into the  water, keeping a decent distance between the two of them, he sat uncomfortably. He was definately a tad bit nervous.* - Sun Dec  6 16:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) felt the cold water splash into his face, and his eyes widened in surprise with a bit of recoil. As she spoke his face flushed with a subtle blush, "I...I h-haven't." He stated, with his gaze being averted to the side,  he swallowed hard. It was on the more embarrassing side afterall. He was hurt a small bit about being called pitiful. But it didn't show.* - Sun Dec  6 16:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked towards Asteroth for a moment wondering what she was wearing, but as to not stare for too long his gaze also found the water. "I've...just n-never had the opportunity or chance to...It is...pretty pitiful isn't it?" He asked, giving a saddened smile.  His finger did raise to his cheek to scratch in mock embarrassment at Asteroth's comment of not biting to roughly. "D-Do you swim a lot?" He asked curiously.* - Sun Dec  6 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) shook his head. "I was just curious, I was thinking maybe some day I could bring you somewhere you like, so you can relax after a s-stressful day." He stated, he was getting a bit more comfortable and decided to scoot closer. Although still more than an arms length away, "T-Thanks for letting me join you...Asteroth-sama." He stated lightly, looking into the water, he wasn't sure how to lead the conversation. "Is tere anything else you enjoy doing..?"* - Sun Dec  6 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head "I-I wouldn't dare A-Asterot-sama." He stated looking down towards the water, beforrrrrrrrspoke "Then maybe...I'll take you s-shopping if you w-want later." He suggested,* - Sun Dec  6 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked towards Asteroth as he spoke "Do you like traveling...?" He asked curiously, maintaining his same distance. And his gaze fell upon the water.* - Sun Dec  6 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Somewhat. - Sun Dec  6 19:00:54 2015
