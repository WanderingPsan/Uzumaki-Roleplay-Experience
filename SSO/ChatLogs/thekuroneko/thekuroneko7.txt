<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath he was debating which of the missions he should go about completing first, honestly he wasn't sure for himself, he figured it'd be interesting to see the extent of how fast he could get these missions done efficiently, he figured he'd have to figure it out but if he was going to be staying within this village, he figured he had to advance himself considerably. He smiled subtly before cracking his knuckles.

He approached the desk, and began to retrieve the flowers that needed to be delivered once he had located said things he'd smile to himself. This was going to be an interesting day so he took the flowers and began to head across the room before out the door, he yawned subtly taking a deep breath he smiled to himself, understanding this would be an interesting day afterall. 

He debated on what he should do and ultimately he had felt as if finishing these missions would be ideal to his developmental process. Even if he ran a thousand easy missions ultimately he felt like it'd be better than sitting here doing absolutely nothing. He figured everything had a purpose and he just needed to find the purpose of these missions not that he intended to dispute it at all.* - Tue Dec  8 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: Good, they are learning. - Tue Dec  8 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath upon finishing the first mission, he returned to the mansion where the elderly woman he was supposed to be escorting was currently waiting for him, so he yawned, and cracked his knuckles, he figured this would be fairly easy, with a simple inhale followed by a brief exhale he acknowledged the lady. When he approached he introduced himself to her, even though he was taking his time, he was mentally training. Contemplating his jutsu, and how to get better, he was skilled.

He walked around the village with the old lady, and even helped her across the streets which were filled with robbers. He was taking his time, afterwards he looked up towards the sky. He noticed how much time had been passing, but he shrugged to himself, it was all fine he'd make progress and advance one way or another. He didn't seem perplexed at all, he wasn't a giant fan of the elderly.

But that was simply because of personal reasons, it wasn't a big concern to him, all together. So it was something he'd handle on his own, he figured the old lady could use some entertainment. And as such he proceeded to summon a crow he aimed to have mounted on his shoulder for the remainder of the time, he had a lot to advance, and honestly he was surprised to be making this progress.

As he took a deep breath, he exhaled before he continued walking he figured that at the very least,sticking with these people would keep him alive. But he didn't wish to get to the point he became cocky, that wasn't his goal. So he had to take care and advnace slowly, taking heed oif his own weaknesses, he needed to progress.

So he yawned, as they had walked around a vast majority of the safer district of the village, he found it interesting that nothing promising had come, and he nodded his head. It was a fairly boring and relaxed day, and that was alright, he'd survive, and he'd definately live to see another day. With that said, he moved on.* - Tue Dec  8 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) decided to take it easy, as he walked around with the crow on his shoulder, he figured the crow would make his next mission all the easier, so all he had to do now was focus on the new mission before his eyes, as long as he focused and trained, this would make life so much easier, and he was excited for that, he had a lot more to do, so he cracked his knuckles, he was anticipating a lot of fun to be had. But he went into the mansion and ultimately the supply closet.

Once he had entered he retrieved a broom before heading to the stairs, he'd slowly begin to take a deep breath before he began subtly sweeping the stairs. Starting from the highest, he'd sweep the dirt down to the next level, before the next, until eventually it had gathered at the ground. He smiled to himself this would be interesting, not really though. As he swept the dirt down, he shrugged his shoulders.

Ultimately he had swept down to the lowest stair, and there was nothing left to do, besides sweep it off, and once that was done, he yawned to himself, that was that. And that was his Third mission completed today, so he had nothing left to worry about but that was fine, so he yawned and took a deep breath before he began to head off to do his next mission.* - Tue Dec  8 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath, as he released his crow, and it took off towards the sky, circling the air above him. As he exited the village, he figured this would be a fairly interesting and at the same time boring task,  he had to locate a cat which had somehow managed to escape the village, with his trusty crow this would be a lot easier to do, so he didn't seem to mind all that much, with a subtle inhale, he also exhaled, cracking his knuckles. As he focused.

He was walking through the forest passing multiple different types of trees his eyes looked around scanning the surrounding area for the cat that had gone missing, there wasn't  any luck, so he traveled and traveled. Getting further away from the village, his eyes scanned around, until he had sighed The crow had branched out even further  ahead of him. Creating a sphere of sensory where the cat could be.

It traveled, looking but once again nothing ever happened. He was stuck there and he was waiting, so he sat, and waited some more patiently, until something happened something he wasn't expecting...His crow cawed.  His gaze shot towards the sky, as he took notice of what had just happened, and he believed his crow had just located something so he began to run towards where the crow was.

Upon arriving at a small clearing there was a tree in the middle, a tree which contained a cat, he took a deep breath and slowly he began to approach the tree looking up to the cat. "C'mon down." He stated lightly though he knew this wouldn't work he sighed to himself, before cracking his knuckles, looking up towards the beast.

Eventually he resorted to the use of Suimen to go and retrieve the cat and once it was successfully retrieved, he'd return to the village with his trusty crow. Arriving back into the village, he'd hand over the cat, and prepare for his payment. With a simply yawn he noticed that was the last of his missions so he was home free and safe.* - Tue Dec  8 01:51:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: Who's ready for this Domu dick? - Tue Dec  8 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head as he took the scroll Eiyu had given him, and he yawned subtly he figured this would be a fairly easy read, cracking his knuckles. He inhaled followed by a deep exhale, as he cracked his knuckles focusing upon the scroll before him, he traced his finger to the beginning portion of the scroll and he began to read, taking his time, he yawned to himself as his gaze traced over the text and he yawned he was finding this to be a pretty interesting technique.

The Shadow clone technique, it was exciting and at the same token, he wondered what unknown damages this technique could do to one's mind with the splitting of a person's body repeatedly. He was wondering how he'd successfully advance himself, but he doubted he had the stamina neccessary to train with this technique and he wasn't sure if he cared enough to further advance into it, so he shrugged his shoulders.

Once he had finished learning the technique, the scroll was rolled back up before offered back to Eiyu, with a nod of his head, he smiled to himself, "I see, I appreciate it, Rai-sama." He was debating what else to learn, but honestly, his skill set consisted of techniques which utilized absolutely no handseals, he had an idea for an elemental technique, he'd be sure to try in the future, so he took a deep breath and relaxed against the wall.* - Tue Dec  8 20:59:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yeah, I could do that. - Wed Dec  9 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Whenever you're ready. - Wed Dec  9 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The first move is yours. - Wed Dec  9 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: --- - Wed Dec  9 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Oh, it's a spar. - Wed Dec  9 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) reached for the hilt of his Katana, his fingers slowly curling around the length, before it was pulled from it's scabboard. His gaze settled upon Eiyu as he spoke "Do you intend to take the private exam? There'll be a World wide one in Four years." He stated lightly, "Your chances of passing with sky-rocketed at that point." He stated, as he tilted his blade so that the blunt edge was facing Eiyu. And he kicked off his hind leg, propellinh himself forth, as the blade was bought across Horizontally. With a moderate amount of speed, Roughly Ten attack Speed at this point. His gaze locked onto the Kage, "I wondered how skilled he is?"* - Wed Dec  9 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) smiled briefly, he certainly hoped, that Eiyu didn't believe that was the extent of his abilities. He watched carefully as the male weaved his series of handseals, and he honestly wasn't sure what to expect. So when the muddy water formed beneath him, his eyes widened, as he felt his balance being stripped from beneath him. And instinctively his sword was driven into the ground, aiming to plant him firmly where he was, thus stopping his progression for a moment. Though once the torrent had died down, he braced himself for whatever follow-up Eiyu had in store.* - Wed Dec  9 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) blinked as he saw the soil beginning to erect before him.  With his Katana drawn, he swung it horizontally. The slash was fast, amazingly so, aimed at slicing directly through the earth, and with a stroke of intellegence, chakra sparked around his blade for good measure, causing lightning to coat the length, his strike was quick and fluid. He wasted no time with his attempt, as his gaze shifted to Eiyu, the moment that quick attack was done he'd charge forward once again, barely making half the ground he would've normally due to taking the time to defend against the strike. Of course if he was unable to do so, he would've aimed to block one of them, if not completely cut through it.* - Wed Dec  9 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath as he noticed the scroll being tossed into the air, the chakra flow gathered at the tip of his blade, as he took a deep breath his gaze focused on Eiyu's chest. As his blade was swung towards Eiyu from a distance, the lightning gathering into a ball which traveled along the length of his blade, before being discharged, shot towards Eiyu's chest as the assault of weapons fell. He made no attempt to escape this trap, though he doubted he'd be able to efficiently do so to begin with. But the ball of lightning was aimed at hitting him hard, But not with any intent to seriously injure, more so to knock him to the ground. After completing the swing, he'd probably be trapped by the wires. He'd notice his lack of mobility. "Hmph, Seems like I've been check mated." He stated, with a gentle smile.* - Wed Dec  9 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) smiled, it seemed like he had bought himself some extra time to do this. Though he had tottally forgotten this was the male that had given him the scroll for the Shadow clone technique. He took a deep breath and jammed his blade into the ground before, following behind Eiyu, as a single clone was conjured with the formation of a single seal. The clone took point, and began running toward Eiyu, in an arcing motion, whilst the original took route from the other way, both holding onto their Katanas, as the aimed to pincer the Kage, although due to their positioning it'd be a bit longer to go 'around'.* - Wed Dec  9 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath as he noticed Eiyu sinking into the ground, and immediately he himself kicked off of the ground. Landing on his clone's shoulders, he took a stance, taking a deep breath, as his eyes scanned the ground around him, taking this moment to catch his breath, he understood that usually if someone intended to go beneath the ground it was probably to launch a surprise attack so he had to be ready. His clone supported the weight of the original with ease. And the original held his blade out, with his left arm grasping the forearm of the extended arm. Chakra surged through the blade as he waited.* - Wed Dec  9 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath as he looked towards Eiyu, and suddenly his blade was raised towards the sky, before the chakra gathered along his blade. Gathering into a ball of lightning before it was swung towards Eiyu's position, rocketing across the field, aimed for his face, but here was where it got good. The moment he moved to react to the incomming ball of lightning, his clone discharged a second, the attack sent by the original was aimed to draw his attention from the second, that was aimed at his stomach or hip region. Neither attack aimed to cause serious damage, but aiming to knock him off his feet. "This guy is really fun to spar, I can see why people do this often."* - Wed Dec  9 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) thinks: I'm going to have to force Menma to cut his hair...... - Wed Dec  9 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) thinks: He looks like a female from the back. - Wed Dec  9 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) leaps from the shoulder of his clone dispelling it as he approached Eiyu, crouching down he'd offer him his hand. Assuming the fight was over, his Blade was sheathed, And he spoke "That was a good spar, Lord Raikage." He stated with a gentle smile, as he crouched at the man's side. He was truly interesting in a spar, and he knew in any other setting he probably would've been the one that lost in that battle. Though he was happy to experience a win, Though it didn't feel like a win. This was a friendly spar, so did it really matter what the outcome was? Had Eiyu grasped his hand he'd aim to help the man up.* - Wed Dec  9 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Stop looking at my ass Nii-san~. - Wed Dec  9 02:22:56 2015
