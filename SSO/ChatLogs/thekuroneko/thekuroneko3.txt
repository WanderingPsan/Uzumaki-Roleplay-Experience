<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) blinked as she spoke "Am I? I'm not sure." He stated reaching in his pocket, he'd pull out a circular shaped package. Upon opening it was revealed to be a cookie, which he raised to his mouth biting down. He took a bite at the cookie before he spoke "Does your diet consist of gum? Or do you eat ramen and other things?" He was curious he probably wouldn't be surprised if she ate only gum as that was the only thing he's seen her eat....And she has....6 Arms.* - Thu Nov 26 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) stared at her as he spoke "Hmmmmmmm." It was long and drawn out to show how hard he was thinking "Hungry?" He asked, finishing up his last bit of cookie.* - Thu Nov 26 15:17:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Curry it is! - Thu Nov 26 15:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) motions for her to follow, looking at Mitarashi, he wondered if he wanted to come. He was his brother, so an invitation was always extended to him,  "So Ari-chan, On the off chance you're staying. The Raikage is making squads, That should be fun. I just hope I don't get placed in the same squad as the boy that calls every girl a prostitute....He's annoying."* - Thu Nov 26 15:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) led her into the restaurant it was nothing special but, when they entered he moved to pull out her seat out of habit. He was raised to be a gentlemen although he wasn't always like that, After she sat he'd move to push her chair in as he spoke "I see, I tried to stab him for insulting one of my friends...But the Raikage was against it. I'm sorry for what he did though. Although, if you're placed in the same squad, You'd have an excuse to beat him up in a spar."* - Thu Nov 26 15:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) didn't mind, he also understood her hate. Since he had his own source of hate. He looked at the menu, as he located the curry section he figured if she was having it so would he but he spoke "No problem." In reply to her thanks, after a moment,  he had decided to go with Mild curry,  "I'd probably do the same in your case, honestly...How'd he even become a Shinobi..? It's beyond me." He stated lightly, after a moment had she decided on what she wanted he'd call the waitress over to order.

"Mild....Red Curry and....Coffee...Black! Please." He stated, with a nod of his head, he'd prefer to sweeten his own coffee anyway. "Milk and sugar on the side."* - Thu Nov 26 15:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) laughed subtly, he didn't mind her language. It was a nice change of pace from most people, but as he looked to Ari, he spoke "You have me beat, I'm not good with spicy food." He spoke, opening his mouth he fanned his tongue as if saying that it's too spicy for him. Listening to the rest of what she said, he laughed once again. "Are you a hand to hand fighter then, Ari-chan?" He asked curiously, realising that with six arms she could be quite proficient in the art. * - Thu Nov 26 16:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) smiled as he heard her words upon food, he didn't say anything he was enjoying this conversation as he asked "What about gum?  Do you have a favorite flavor?" He asked curiously, watching as he leaned forward, he stared into her eyes as she spoke, before his eyes shifted to the side, letting his breath out as he spoke "Ari-chan, you're a tease. You're going to make me find out for myself, aren't cha'?" He asked, in a fairly cheerful tone while imitating a pouting face.* - Thu Nov 26 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) laughed a bit as he heard her words, slowly he reached for the milk, and poured a little bit into the coffee, until it had a milk-chocolate coloring, before adding two packets of sugar. He proceeded to stir it with a spoon, as he looked towards her "Psshaw, I'll give you a run for your money, whenever you're ready to go~." He spoke, with a light chuckle, as he listened to her dessert choices "I'm more....peppermint kind of guy, I've never honestly had cotton candy flavored gum. I should go find me a pack some time." He noticed Akarui, enter the restaurant. He had seen her before, but he wasn't to familiar with her. But he wouldn't have minded it if she came over at all.* - Thu Nov 26 16:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) coughed a few times, as his gaze shifted off to the side. "I tottally, could've handled it. Mhm." He stated, with a few nods of the head. As he raised his coffee to his mouth, aiming to take a sip without blowing, so the scorching hot coffee hit his tongue. And almost immediately, he was forced to swallow the hot liquid instead of spitting "S-Sh---! Ouch!" He declared, his tongue practically burning, it seems, karma paid him back for lying.* - Thu Nov 26 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ..... - Thu Nov 26 16:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) immediately transitioned from his coffee to the water and began drinking it as if his life had depended upon it. After feeling his mouth, the sensation had been sated...For the most part. "D-Damn...." He muttered, as he looked back to  Ari, he spoke "That didn't happen." He stated, not willing to let his brother catch wind of that.* - Thu Nov 26 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: I wonder if they are together. . .they seem to be having a lot of fun. - Thu Nov 26 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head in thanks as she spoke, "I'm sure, I could manage to avoid getting caught again." He stated nodding his head, he was either cocky or trying to show off...Maybe both, as he smelled her curry, and the scent that wafted into his nostrils made him recoil ."Y-You sure y-you can eat that Ari-chan...? I f-feel like that'd kill someone."* - Thu Nov 26 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) swallowed hard, a bit flustered by her use of -kun, it did in fact catch him off guard. As he looked at the spoon, the spoon she held in front of him. The smell causing him to cough, but he did so off to the side not to cough on her food or on Akarui, as he swallowed hard. Looking at her eyes, "C-Crap..." He thought to himself, he was a sucker for that kind of thing, he noticed Akarui approaching and he heard her speaking he knew that Ari would clear that misunderstanding. As he nodded her head to her question "S-Shit..." He stated, as he opened his mouth, and leaned forward. He wasn't ready to give up this fight just yet.* - Thu Nov 26 17:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) ||Leaned forward to allow her to push the spoon into his mouth if she desired.* - Thu Nov 26 17:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chinpu, Akarui(Weaver22) thinks: So Cute~ - Thu Nov 26 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Yesssssssssssssss. - Thu Nov 26 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: New bestie. - Thu Nov 26 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) was mentally crying. "T-These women are evil!"  He thought to himself, as Ari inched the spoon closer to his lips, he had that eerie feeling if he did it. He'd probably die, but...He wouldn't look like a punk....So...He had to do it, opening his mouth he'd lean forward. With Akarui's words, it'd be the greatest insult to his pride, if he let her do it first. And he was being manipulated by puppy-dog eyes. So he moved to take the spoon into his mouth...First what hit him, was the general heat that radiated off of the food. Secondly, was the extreme spiciness, which almost immediately caused him to tear up. Coupled with the fact he had just burned his tongue,  he tried to swallow -fast-, before it could fully corrupt his tastebuds. But when he did, his nostrils were burning, his face turned red. As it rolled down his throat, burning...a -lot- as it went down. His palm slammed on the table, the inside of his mouth felt like someone has just shat out a minature sun. And his hand shot for his glass of water, "Wah...tur..." He moaned out in agonizing...burning pain.  His mouth felt dry, this heat was incredible. And he aimed to down the water, which did little to help his burning tastebuds.* - Thu Nov 26 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) his face was practically scarlet, as the milk was bought to him. Quickly he reached for the glass, raising it to his lips. As he took a long sip. Before slamming the glass down as he looked to Ari, "T...This is nothing." He groaned out, his face practically looked like it wanted to explode, the spiciness still overpowering him, it was a miracle he was able to say that much before gasping out. He moved to finish off the glass of milk, which was helping to sate the spiciness but by no means complete get rid of it. He was quite stubborn, though he had learned his lesson that much showed on his face, even if he didn't want to verbably admit to it.* - Thu Nov 26 17:33:00 2015
