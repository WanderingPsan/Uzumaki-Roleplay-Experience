<br><font color=yellow>*Takahina, Menma(The Kuro Neko) woke up under one of the trees, his coal black eyes scanned the surrounding people. As he stood, his Katana strapped firmly against his back, keeping him standing upright with perfect posture, he noticed his brother, and then he noticed their leader. With his right hand going across his chest, he bowed his head. "Hello M'Lord."* - Fri Nov 20 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takahina, Menma(The Kuro Neko) contemplated his answer, thinking upon it before he spoke "It could be better." He admitted, running a hand through his long black hair which came to a ponytail which trailed down his back. He reachced for his blade holding it up for Ortho to see, "My blade's becomming....Dull..I'm going to need to buy a new one soon...That's the reason I came to you honestly...Hoping to earn some money."* - Fri Nov 20 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takahina, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a moment closing his eyes, he considered this name 'Uchiha', it was definately a weird name. So foreign against his tongue, his gaze found Ortho, as he scratched his cheek. His gaze shifted to his brother, as his gaze settled upon the male, wondering what he would say for the briefest of moments before he finally spoke "I....Like it." He stated nodding his head, with a gentle smile.* - Fri Nov 20 03:46:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Our village has flourished in the economics aspect, but I'll still supply you with a mission to earn your share. - Fri Nov 20 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Alright! - Fri Nov 20 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Roam the outskirts of the settlement and make sure there are no animals springing traps that have been set. - Fri Nov 20 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: This'll be a D ranked mission seeing as though there are wild animals afoot. - Fri Nov 20 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: This is a good start...After maybe a Hundred, I'll be able to buy a high quality blade..! - Fri Nov 20 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Well, I'm off to bed. - Fri Nov 20 03:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) reaches to catch the scroll as he bowed respectfully. "I'll be off M'Lord!" Stated the young Uchiha, before he prepared to scurry off.* - Fri Nov 20 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Stay safe. Don't be afraid to contact me if anything comes up. - Fri Nov 20 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Yessir! - Fri Nov 20 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath looking around, his hands found the back of his head,  he figured this would be a fairly easy mission. And a single hand was moved through his hair, his coal black eyes searched around the Gates before he headed outside of them. He had a lot to do, he wondered how much he'd be able to get done in a short period of time, afterall if he was to advance, he'd need to complete numerous missions.  His hands moved together as he cracked his knuckles.

Looking around he spotted the first of the traps and he moved over, checking it it wasn't sprung, so he moved around in a circular way, searching the surroundings for animals big enough to spring the trap, so he smiled nodding his head. He yawned this seemed to be going fairly well, so he continued looking around, moving through several bushes he inhaled followed by a brief exhale, he was thinking that some light meditation could be done after this.

He had no where near enough money to buy a sword, and he was sure after this he'd still need over a thousand times as much money, and that was depressing. He was considering that maybe he'd also need some armor as well, which would also be...ridiculously expensive, he sighed, once again. Money, money money. It made the world go round and his world had stopped since he had none.

He continued searching for any traps, and continued to stumble upon them, until he had finally come across the last one. They all seemed to be fairly safe and no animals or droppings were nearby which would raise concerns. So he sighed to himself, looking around once again, before he decided to head back into the village, some missions weren't as exciting and who knows maybe the next time he came around there'd be animals.

He couldn't expect excitement all the time, so when he returned he approached Ortho and repeating the same bowing position he spoke "M'Lord, I've completed the assignment." He did have something to ask, it showed on his face he was troubled. He realised this would be a long road to get his weapon, and he was no where near having enough. Scratching his chin, he offered the scroll back to Ortho for documenting.* - Fri Nov 20 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) blinked as he looked at the money "M'Lord...This is way....to much." He stated offering Nine thousand back..* - Fri Nov 20 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Jeez, you're swimming in money Ortho. - Fri Nov 20 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: T-Thank you M'Lord. - Fri Nov 20 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath as he moved to sit by one of the trees, crossing his legs in a manner similar to that of the Indians.."May I ask you a question, M'Lord?" He asked lightly.* - Fri Nov 20 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm? I wouldn't say tha- - Fri Nov 20 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Could you assist me with my training later? - Fri Nov 20 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Of course. - Fri Nov 20 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That'll be no problem. - Fri Nov 20 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head as he closed his eyes and inhaled through his nose, followed by an exhale through his mouth. Slowly he began to meditate, clearing his mind of all outside influences, he was considering doing this after each Mission for self-reflection. Maybe he just needed time to himself to calm his nerves after his adrenaline was pumping, regardless. He thought of nothing, and listened to the sound of his breathing as he meditated, part of him was wondering what he should work on himself afterwards. But that was a thought for another day, for now, meditation was his priority it was good for the soul.* - Fri Nov 20 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) after a while of meditating he felt as if his mind had been cleared thoroughly. Standing up he dusted himself off, before approaching Ortho, "M'Lord...Are you free to begin now?" He asked, he seemed to have cleared his mind, and as such he felt a lot calmer and in control. He was actually fairly happy, a smile donned his face as he cracked his knuckles. * - Fri Nov 20 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: What are we doing? - Fri Nov 20 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Lead the way M'Lord. - Fri Nov 20 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: Ew...They're calling him Lord.... - Fri Nov 20 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Lead the way M'Lord. - Fri Nov 20 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked at Ortho and nodded his head as he spoke "Sounds alright to me." He stated, reaching for the hilt of his Katana, as it was drawn from it's sheath. He held it out in front of him, with the point facing Ortho, Menma wasn't the fastest or the strongest. He was just average, so he hoped to at least show potential rather than outright impress.* - Fri Nov 20 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head, as he inhaled followed by a brief exhale. As suddenly his blade shot down vertically, as if aiming to hit Ortho. He fully anticipated the male to dodge the strike, that was what he intended for Ortho to do. But he didn't something awkward, Menma continued with the downwards strike until the tip of his blade had found itself lodged into the ground, and with a single motion he balanced himself on the hilt following through with shooting his leg out towards Ortho's chest. This all took place during a fluid motion, he was aiming to do what he was instructed, but he hoped to catch Ortho off guard.* - Fri Nov 20 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head as he took in Ortho's words, and he took a deep breath. Before kicking off his hind leg, he was propelled forward this time he sent his chakra through his blade, causing it to ingite with electricity, once it had coated his blade, he attempted to swing diagnolly at Ortho's shoulder. But about mid-way through the swing, his left hand found the hilt of his Katana, and with a smooth transition he moved into a stab attack aimed at Ortho's stomach. He was a fast learner, he was trying his best to read his opponent, taking a deep breath he concentrated on the task at hand.* - Fri Nov 20 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) smiled briefly, as he felt Ortho's hand grasp his wrist, and suddenly his chakra flared and so did the chakra surrounding the Katana. Attempting to take the male off guard by this sudden revelation, had he succeeded. His right foot would be swiftly bought around, aimed at the male's left hip, hoping to make a nice and solid kick to his side, as he took a deep breath, he was determined to impress. As much as he tried to stay a step ahead of his opponent, Ortho was a lot more experienced than he was, therefore he had the Ultimate advantage in this fight, but he didn't think about that as he continued on.* - Fri Nov 20 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath, as he headed under the tree, and closed his eyes, entering a meditative state. He controlled his breathing as to not allow it to disturb his trance, with his mind clear he simply meditated.* - Fri Nov 20 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Hello, M'Lord. - Sat Nov 21 01:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) decided to take a gander at the scroll he had been given, inhaling followed by a brief exhale. It was unraveled before being raised to eye level, with a slow sigh, he began to read all that was held within the scroll, he was in no hurry so he took his time to understand everything that he read. He yawned as he was getting a bit tired, but since he was given the scroll he had decided to take his time and read it.

He scratched his cheek, as he had come to the end of the technique and he had a firm grasp upon what he had read, he offered the scroll back to Hatsujin, "I think I have it down." He stated with a small smile, as he moved to take a seat on the ground. Running a single hand through his hair as he looked around at all who were present.* - Sat Nov 21 02:08:25 2015

He hadn't met her before so he introduced himself "My name is Menma." He said in a gentle tone.* - Sat Nov 21 12:26:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) contemplated the name, as he tapped his foot upon the ground, "Hm.....Sai-chan?" He had considered after thinking about the possible spelling and pronunciation of her name. At least how he considered it, he had made a nickname he intended to call her. "I have a bad habit of falling asleep sparatically,or maybe we could've met earlier." He bowed his head apologetically.

"But It's a pleasure to meet you."* - Sat Nov 21 12:33:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) on the other hand was dressed in a black high collar shirt, with black pants. A navy blue sash wrapped around his waist. And a Katana strapped to his back, as he crouched down,examining her attire, before he spoke "I'm from Kumogakure originally. Though I was never an actual shinobi, I spent my time working in my 'guardian's' Ramen shop."* - Sat Nov 21 12:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) wouldn't dare! Okay...maybe he would, but he wasn't this time. His eyes met her own, as he spoke "My brother told me about it, so here I am. Though I had left Kumogakure a week or so before hearing about this, so it all worked out." He explained, with a subtle smile.* - Sat Nov 21 12:45:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked towards one of the trees, before back to Eri, with a slight nod of his head he acknowledged Hatsujin's statement before he spoke "Mitsuru." He stated. Rubbing his right arm with his left.* - Sat Nov 21 12:50:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why would he send for Hatsu.... he trusts him so much, it agrivates me. - Sat Nov 21 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head, that'd explain why she asked if he was from Konoha. "My decision is to stay here, there's no need for me to move to different villages. And I wouldn't betray the trust Ortho-san, has placed in me. Nor the name 'Uchiha', which he gave me." He explained lightly, looking at her headband, he did take notice of her use of the word family. But after a moment his gaze returned to her.* - Sat Nov 21 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thought about her question as he spoke "I don't believe we're related by blood, but he gave me this name a few days ago.." He stated lightly. Remaining in his crouched position he was seriously wondering what he could eat and a subtle growling of his stomach could be heard.* - Sat Nov 21 13:07:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) contemplated her question, as he shrugged his shoulders. "I'm not sure." He explained, taking a non-subtle look up her skirt. Before he coughed to the side, aiming to cover up his antics. "I wonder though...Just why he gave me that name."* - Sat Nov 21 13:18:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) scratched his cheek subtly as his gaze shifted from beneath Eri's skirt "Black!?" He thought to himself, a faint grin appeared on his face, as his cheeks reddened a bit. He probably could steal another glance, so he'll have to live with what he had now. Until the perversion strikes again! He took a deep breath, aiming to calm his nerves.* - Sat Nov 21 13:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) whistled briefly, as his gaze turned away from her as he kicked the ground he swallowed hard. "Was...Was I caught!?" He thought to himself, attempting to play it off. His gaze found a small ant on the ground. "Wow, ants are definately interesting....They're pretty strong for their size aren't they?" He commented in a clear attempt to divert attention.* - Sat Nov 21 13:26:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) walked at a slow pace trailing a few paces behind her, as his eyes shifted to his blade, it was getting tiresome to Carry. So he took it off his back. And held it by the strap, it was beginning to rust.* - Sat Nov 21 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked at the water, as he slowly moved over, crouching at it's edge, allowing the water to just barely scrape at the bottom of his boots, as he removed his sword, holding it off to the side, before setting it down as he spoke "So Sai-chan, How'd you meet the Raikage?" He asked out of curiosity, as he reached for a pebble on the ground, tossing it up a few times, as he tested it's weight. As his gaze settled on the water.* - Sat Nov 21 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked towards her as she spoke and he simply replied "Did you manage? It seems like you did." He asked, as chakra began to gather around the pebble. And suddenly lightning sparked around it, before he took notice of a fish, and chucked the pebble forward into the water, causing an electrical surge to rock the water.Aiming to stun the fish, as he looked at his handiwork he wondered if maybe he got a few extra with that one.* - Sat Nov 21 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) decided to take a longshot as he spoke "Thank you, Thank you very much. I had half a mind to take you up on your skinny-dipping style of fishing if you joined me. " He joked, scratching his cheek out of mock-embarrassment, as he spoke:

"Not the best joke.." He stated, as he readied up his next shot, launching it into the water, he hit yet another fish. As he asked "Would you like some extra to maybe take home?"* - Sat Nov 21 19:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) stopped for a second, before looking at the water. "I probably would've looked stupid and like a coward. I don't think I would've been able to follow through with that method and might've backed out." He admitted, with a coy smile, as he tossed the next rock, there were a total of Five fish  floating against the surface at this point. He seemed to have enough chakra to be repeating this process over and over again.* - Sat Nov 21 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked at the water as he spoke "Even if I didn't, I'm sure you could've deduced it based off of how I am...It's who I am, so I just accept it and roll with it. Is it that odd?" He asked, looking towards her with a shy smile, as he offered her the rock, "Want to try?"* - Sat Nov 21 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head, as he spoke "I'm easy to read, don't know if that's a blessing or a curse." He stated, with a light chuckle. As the rock was thrown, he reached for his  Katana, and began guiding the fish towards him, keeping his body extended over the lake. As they floated over to him, he threw them onto the sand as he spoke: 

"I'm not a good cook, so maybe we can find a chef or someone who is decent to maybe fry them?" He asked curiously. Menma, was a fairly gentle looking person. Despite carrying a sword, it didn't look like he had the potential to start fights, nor kill. It may be a mystery why he even joined a village of gladiators.* - Sat Nov 21 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head as he spoke "Stay safe, Sai-chan,  I'll see you later." He stated taking a seat at the water's edge, he laid down upon his back with his hands behind his head.* - Sat Nov 21 19:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath as he looked towards Edge, he was terrified...his body shook and trembled at the sight of the man. His hand reached for his old and dull blade, Ortho, and Eri were being threatened...And he was just...sitting here. "Why?...Why are you here..? Why are you attacking them?" He asked Edge, he had never been so scared in his life, never having faced actual battle before, he held the urge to turn around and run, he didn't want to fight this...Man---No This demon. He swallowed hard,  he couldn't allow this man to kill his friend....nor the one who was kind enough to allow him to share their name.

"P-Please leave!" He declared.

The blade trembled in his grasp, as the point was held towards Edge.* - Sat Nov 21 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) immediately ran forward, his eyes becomming blood red, followed by the development of a single tomoe which circled his center pupil. He swallowed hard, his Katana had been firmly gripped in his hands. "Let...her go!" He declared, as he ran forward. Though he wasn't  nearly fast enough to traverse the entiriety of this gap in a single spurt, and probably was enroute to be blocked by guards. Something told him Eri was about to die, that was what he felt...Could he really allow himself to lose a friend so quickly after getting one? He wasn't by any means strong or brave, he was terrified, his hands trembled, he was sweating.

His heart raced and he desired to cower.* - Sat Nov 21 21:40:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) his scarlet pupils drilled holes into Edge's back, as he saw him step on Ortho, his chest raised and lowered. He was terrified, the blade in his hand trembled, he was angry though.. "Am...I really...going to let them...step on Ortho-san...Kill Sai-chan?" He couldn't believe this, as he ran forward, it was a sad thing when a man ran into a fight he knew he wouldn't win. As he approached Edge's soldiers, his blade was swung, aiming to his at least one of them. Using the blunt side of his blade, he didn't use the bladed side he had a fear of killing people. He didn't want to risk...enjoying it.* - Sat Nov 21 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a step forward, as he saw Hatsujin and Eri hit the ground, and all of a sudden his body felt heavier. His heart beat to a painfull melody, as he stepped forward each step felt like the weight on his shoulders had been increased. Until he fell to his knees, his eyes wide in horror, his chest ached, and his sword fell from his hands hitting the ground the clang og metal against conrete sounded through the area. This was...His family...wasn't it?

Hatsujin, was someone he looked up to...A strength he desired to achieve to fight alongside his 'family', his head lowered in shame at his own weakness. As tears swelled in his eyes, he finally had a family...And so easily...it was ripped away, one possible future had been destroyed on his timeline, the future, that Hatsujin and himself developed a bond grew to be brothers. Shattered. Gone.

Tears swelled in his eyes, as his hands balled into fists,  and he slammed them upon the ground, as he looked to Eri, he didn't even know if she was dead or alive. His friend, he had begun to form a bond with her in his eyes, gazed into the mysteriousness of the woman known as Supaiku. He hoped and prayed, she'd survive, the words of Edge resonated within his ears. That she'd die if the seal wasn't removed.

"Another person..that I'll lose...because I was weak." The thought flashed through his mind.

As tears swelled upon his scarlet eyes before rolling down his cheeks, his long black ponytail, hung against his back. "Why...Why this family...? Why now of all times?" He cursed the world, he cursed the ground where he stood, "If I wasn't....weak...If I was faster...I could've taken Hatsujin's place...He was more beneficial to this settlement....to this family."* - Sat Nov 21 22:51:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) continued sobbing and tears rolling down his cheeks, as his hands hit the ground his knuckles began bleeding. But he didn't stop, this pain was only a fraction of that Hatsujin had endured. "Why...Why....WHY!?"* - Sat Nov 21 22:59:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: ....S-Sai-chan? - Sun Nov 22 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) as he approached, she might've noticed, that there was blood dripping from his knuckles. And his eyes were red not from sharingan, but that may've seemed like he had been crying or on the verge of doing so for a long period of time.* - Sun Nov 22 19:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) wiped his eyes wit his hands and subsequently smeared a bit of blood as he moved closer to her, he noticed that she was patched up. "A-Are....y-you really okay?" He asked, an entirely new set of tears seemed to have begun to swell in his eyes,  "I...I thought...y-you might've..." He paused, before he attempted to hug her. Sniffling and snotty, "I-I'm glad you're alright!" He declared.* - Sun Nov 22 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a moment, and continued tearing up, holding back his tears. As she hugged him back, he didn't wish to hurt her further. So he hugged her lightly, as to not agitate any wounds which remained. "H-Hatsu....H-He...I didn't....want to....l-lose you both." He declared, through sobs, not releasing her as he still wasn't sure if this was some kind of trick his mind played on him. He kept replaying the fight, of her and Ortho laying on the ground, and Hatsujin's trampled body.* - Sun Nov 22 19:40:09 2015
