<br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) after a few more moments, he would've stepped back. Wiping his face once,again, his knuckles stung. And he noticed that he had quite a few cuts on them. As he looked towards Eri, he didn't say anything, but his eyes showed that he hoped that she'd stay true to her words, she was the only person he had come to call a friend since he came to live here. * - Sun Nov 22 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a seat on the ground looking up to Eri "H-Hey Sai-chan." He stated, his hands were now bandaged, and he seemed to be playing with his bandages, "Itchy.." He mutted beneath his breath.* - Mon Nov 23 00:57:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked to Ortho as he was addressed, and his hands clenched, so hard his nails dug into his flesh. He wanted to tell Ortho "You don't have to do this. We can all walk away and find another way to continue surviving...To make sure you live." He wanted to say a lot, and time was running out. He trembled, and tears swelled in his eyes, his heart played a painful meoldy. As he heard Ortho's words.

He found it hard to believe such a person actually existed, his head bowed to Ortho as he spoke "This...This isn't goodbye Ortho-san...This is....a see you later." He stated, his voice trembled and cracked, he said it more to reassure himself than Ortho, he was scared. Terrified...This family he had managed to work his way into was being torn apart.

Hatsujin....Now Ortho, who was next? How many people...would he watch fly by.... While he was unable to save them. That thought scared him, he realised in this moment.

He didn't fear dying. He was scared of living knowing he didn't do everything he could to save them.* - Mon Nov 23 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked at Ortho one final time, before he turned. Facing the gate, his fragile heart ached.

As he followed in Eri's footsteps.* - Mon Nov 23 20:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) felt Mitarashi's hand ruffling his hair, as he moved to sheathe his blade, he didn't seem to be all to happy. At least not with the current situation, it had him in a foul mood, "I just didn't want anyone messing with Sai-chan." He stated, in a slightly saddened tone. He couldn't help but feel like he betrayed that person.* - Tue Nov 24 01:33:00 2015

Though that wasn't convincing at all, he felt small weaker than he had ever felt before. His inability to protect those around him, it hurt him. He was just...In the way. "I don't....want to talk about it." He told his brother, though he'd probably end up talking to him about it later.* - Tue Nov 24 01:50:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) watched as his brother softly hit him, and he closed his eyes for a moment listening to his words. As he nodded his head, but actually...-snickered-, at Eri's remark about looking like a good or nice girl. But he looked to his brother as he extended  his hand. "I needed that." He stated, truly happy to have received his brother's words, though he was still a bit sad. He looked up to the sky and took a deep breath. "Pouting isn't going to get me anywhere." His gaze shifted to Eri, and in a desperate attempt to break his streak he whispered something to her.* - Tue Nov 24 02:13:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) arrives on the scene, he didn't know what was going on...Not now...Not ever...As his hand reached for his blade. He entered into reasonable range, But he wasn't at the point of entering the battle just yet, his fingers curled around his blade,  he was making his way downtown. "Just....Thirty seconds..." He muttered beneath his breath....He prayed the god would allow his legs to carry him to be on time this time..* - Tue Nov 24 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Whats up Menma? - Tue Nov 24 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looks toward his brother as he spoke, "Wait here it's quiet here...If anything happens...I need you to watch my back. When the coast is clear I'll yell...If anyone comes to the gate do the same. " He stated, as he swallowed hard as he spoke "Ortho...And Eri are fine...I know they are."* - Wed Nov 25 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Alright. - Wed Nov 25 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) as he entered the place, his hand grasped the hilt of his Katana, holding it defensively. As his eyes scanned the surrounding area, looking for any sight of a potential enemy. He realised the area...was silent...To silent, and as he looked towards the sky. It was unsettling...The atmosphere, the area devoid of all animal presence. He continued moving until he approached the plaza, and when he did...His world was changed...forever. His gaze fell to that of Eri, and Ortho.

His heart throbbed and began to speed up, "S-Sai-chan?" He asked, gazing down at Eri's deceased body. And his blade...fell from his grasp, hitting the ground at his feet, and his gaze shifted over to Ortho's body. "O-Ortho-san...?" He asked, no reply...He looked at the pool of their joined blood which had formed beneath their corpses, and his legs felt weak. He collapsed.

He fell to his knees, his body shook and quaked, with a lonliness he had not felt before. His eyes began to swell with tears as he spoke "Y-You two...c-can hear me right...?" He asked, with no reply in return, his body weight fell forward. His palms met the ground. And tears began free falling down his face, dampening the pavement beneath him. His fists balled, and slammed against the pavement,  repeatedly. The steady thumping of his fists, that blade in a ferocious harmony with the pained beat of his heart.

His own blood splattered against the pavement, "Three." He muttered, through a shakey voice, as he trembled in place. "Three.." He repeated, as his head, was lowered to touch the bear pavement beneath him, which was cold and devoid of life. "Three....people.....No....Three parts of my family....Torn apart...." He cried out, his eyes were red with irritation from the vast amount of tears this boy was sheading. 

"Hatsujin...."He spoke in a hushed tone.

"Ortho-san...." His tone was progressively weaker, as a testament to the pain of his heart.

"S-Sai-chan.." His heart, was hearting, these were all those who had grown close to his heart.

"I....wasn't...fast enough...To save them." He cried out, as his hands continued to pound against the pavement, causing his knuckles to bleed, he felt cold...And alone, his gaze fell to their bodies, and he slowly crawled over to them. Staring at the spikes, which connected them together as a testament of their love...Dolls...They were set up like this, to be together like this for an eternity.

"This....This wasn't supposed to be a goodbye!" He declared, his lungs ached. 

"What...happened to see you later?! What happened to -family-! Why....Why...is this happening....Tearing....those I care about...from me...one by one."  He laid on the ground, with his gaze settled upon them, his arms wrapped around his head. Blocking out the light, "I....didn't get here in time...I wasn't fast enough...Once again...They slipped through my fingertips...Because I was weak...Too afraid to fight...To afraid to stand with Ortho....on the battlefield."

His tears had formed a small puddle beneath his frame. "To weak to protect Sai-chan, To slow to save Hatsujin...How.Many.More?!" He screamed, out, and for the first time, he experienced hate, A large majority of the people he cared about...Had been slaughtered, killed by one man....He continued screaming, his voice shaking, and trembling. He would not be contained, nor would he be stopped. He continued until his voice gave out, until his throat ached, and was coarse.

Until his tears wouldn't fall anymore.

"I.....I'm....sorry."* - Wed Nov 25 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Ortho...I'm not strong...I'm not brave! Not any of those things! I'm a weakling that needs to be proteted....The thing...I fear the most....Isn't dying...It's living knowing I couldn't save any of you. - Wed Nov 25 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) laid at the ground, he might've noticed he had become eerily silent, as his head remained on the ground. His own bleeding hands pushed off the ground, as his gaze found his brother's it was cold...Hurt. He reached for his brother's hands, as he spoke "When...I find...this Edge person...I'm going to make him.....Beg.For.Death. Only then...Will Sai-chan...And Ortho-san...Be able to sleep peacefully." He muttered, his grip was tight, he wasn't happy. Nor jolly, he was heart, beyond all believe. 

Looking towards their bodies, he simply spoke "We need to bury them.." And slowly he began to walk forward. At least they'd be burried together, with their bodies pinned together, in the shape of a couple kissing whilst holding hands. Ironic. 

"I'll kill him...until he's dead."* - Wed Nov 25 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) simply stood there watching the bodies, he stated at them. As he sighed.* - Wed Nov 25 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath as he slowly stepped forward beside his brother looking towards the deceased. As he gazed upon them, blood began to seep into his eyes, and within a moment they were scarlet with the development of a single tomoe. As he spoke "Ortho, Sai-chan...There's so much I learned from the both of you, about bravery...About strength. About love, and compassion. You were not only my family...You were my friends." He stated, before he looked towards the citizens.

His Sharingan shining brightly, as he spoke "We... Can't sit here, and grieve..Self-Pity...Not when their killer still walks around, happy and content with what he did....We....must use this time...to rise together...As a family. To get closer, and strengthen our bonds...To move forward ,towards the future they envisioned...A future they would've wanted for us."* - Wed Nov 25 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) sighed as his brother's hand fell on his shoulder, he looked towards the people. "Weak." He muttered, he was angry...furious, he refused to believe these people...were so selfish only to stay here to leech off of Ortho's power, but all was said and done. "I wish to stay." He spoke, in a clear tone, he didn't have any intention of leaving, not just yet. He didn't want to abandon this village like the others had.* - Wed Nov 25 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) sighed as he spoke "Then...for tonight...I will stay here...Then to Kumogakure...I'm sure the Raikage will take us in." He stated, as he took a seat, staring at the graves of their friends.* - Wed Nov 25 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: ....? - Wed Nov 25 19:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) gaze shifted off to the side "N-Nothing." He stated, unable to look at the woman, he swallowed hard. He wasn't good with talking to girls.* - Wed Nov 25 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) blinked at her words, as he spoke "W-Witches?" He asked, that definately startled him, but should she have cared to assess his appearance at all she may've noticed his knuckles were bandaged. But he looked at her "T-Then y-you shouldn't be alone, either Miss..." He stated, before he added "I-I think it'd be safer for us both...If I stuck w-with you...to protect you." He stated, with a nod of his head, he didn't trust his odds out here alone, and he was pretty scared. And sad, though she probably wouldn't notice. He was heart greatly, within, angry..* - Wed Nov 25 19:32:54 2015

She wanted to live...I know she did...I -know-!" He declared, his voice, shaking, It was hard for him...To cope with these deaths...Three people close to him in the span of two weeks. It was hard for him to cope with this.* - Wed Nov 25 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) he felt his blood boiling he wanted...Nothing more than to kill Edge...Violate his corpse, in the manner he had did both Eri and Ortho. And Ultimately he fell to his knees, and cried out. He screamed, releasing all the built up pain that was in his body. His heart ached,  "Train?....Ask for help?" He repeated, as his head bowed, "They...They...Didn't deserve this...Not one bit of it..." He stated, his heart ached, as he cried out, this was a pain he'd never forget.* - Wed Nov 25 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) stared up to Eiyu, as his eyes fell to the ground. He wished to believe in Eiyu's words...But he wasn't sure if he could believe it, He wanted to. And as such, he reached for Eiyu's hands, in an attempt to pull himself to his feet, although it didn't help the aching of his heart, maybe...He'd be able to achieve the power needed too avenge his friends, to allow them to rest in peace...That's all he desired, as he looked at Eiyu he didn't say anything, but he nodded his head, he chose to believe in him at this moment.* - Wed Nov 25 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) stared at the male, he neeeded it, perhaps more than anything else. Power...To save, to prevent, and avenge. That's  why he placed his fath in Eiyu, wishing that he'd help him grow stronger, strong enough to protect, and when he failed to protect to get revenge. For those he cared about. That was all he cared for, he stared back into Eiyu's eyes, praying that his words were true.* - Wed Nov 25 23:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked at her once again as she looked towards him. He looked at her eyes but didn't take notice of their unique attributes due to the subtle overcast created by her hood, not that he was paying any extroadinary detail to them anyway.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) blinked as she approached, him and when her arms sprung out,  his face was actually void of color for all of three seconds. Almost knocking into his brother, "H-Holy!" He declared, his eyes widened in surprise, and mock fear. "T-They're actually r-real!?" He was astonished, as well as a bit fearful which was the natural human reaction to the unknown afterall.* - Thu Nov 26 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) blinked, as he noticed her eyes. And the popping of her gum seemed to resonated within his ear drum. As he watched her arms retract, he stared into her eyes almost mesmerized for a moment "Doujutsu?" He asked himself, as his gaze shifted off to the side perhaps he stared a moment to long. He shyly offered his hand out, along with a bowed head apologetically. "I-I'm sorry, f-for being so rude, I'm Menma."* - Thu Nov 26 02:27:37 2015

But he aimed to grasp her own forearm to shake, he looked at her hand for a moment. Before he spoke "Ari-chan." He stated, with a nod of his head, he offered her a kind smile. Looked at her face, examining the way her hair framed her face, and any other distinct facial features.* - Thu Nov 26 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) contemplated her question as he noticed the slight movement of the skin that covered her eye, symbolizing a raise in her eyebrow. As he spoke "Hm...Ari has multiple meanings, Lion, Eagle, and even brave depending on which culture you come from. Mostly because your eyes, they remind me of someone searching for something, like an animal searching for it's prey...A spider spinning it's web." He stated, with a soft smile.* - Thu Nov 26 02:56:38 2015

He stated with a nod of his head, as he spoke "Hm...You don't look like a Lion or an Eagle....But....With..." Begins counting her arms, "Six arms....Kind of look like a Spider...Maybe Web-chan?" He did still look a bit nervous, he had never met anyone like this but she seemed nice.* - Thu Nov 26 03:06:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked at Ari, briefly, before he relaxed back on the ground.
