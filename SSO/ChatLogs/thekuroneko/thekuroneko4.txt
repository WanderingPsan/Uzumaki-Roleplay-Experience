<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) blinked as he spotted Asteroth and a male he hadn't seen before. He didn't say anything, and stepped to the side, he didn't want to intrude on a potential bout between lovers. He realised when he last met the woman, he had never asked her name, and he was curious since he had met her a second time around...So he'd get to asking that when it was his time.* - Sat Nov 28 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) blinked as she answered his question, perhaps unintentionally he partially thanked Abraxas for propsing the question. But when Asteroth's gaze settled on him for that short period of time. His own gaze found the floor, she seemed like the kind of person that was above others in status...Maybe it was just him, he didn't know why he felt like that.* - Sat Nov 28 03:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) approaches Asteroth, but decided to take the longer way around as to not startle her from behind.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) almost lept out of his skin as she addressed him. "I--Uh..I..." He muttered, definately a bit flustered. As he took a deep breath trying to calm his nerves. "I-I....I've seen you....b-before right? You w-warned me about witches." He stated, he seemed very nervous and obviously it seemed as if he felt he shouldn't be...overstepping his boundaries by talking to her...At least that's how he felt. And he was litterally grasping for straws as he tried to come up with material to talk.

"T-Thank you!" He stated, bowing his head to her.* - Sun Nov 29 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked at the ground, as he took a deep breath as she began speaking with him. Finding her voice to be pleasing to the ears, but also of someone of a higher order, he read context clues when she was cut off by the male approaching form her rear. And when she shouted, his heart almost stopped for a moment as he thought she was addressing him.

"I-I...c-came her looking f-for work.." He admitted, as he noticed Tengoku, immediately his hand reached for the hilt of his Katana, he sensed something was off. He took a deep breath and swallowed, watching him carefully.* - Sun Nov 29 02:34:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) stared at Tengoku as he took a step closer, his fingers curled around his blade, "Don't touch her." He stated, as his eyes zoned in on Tengoku's persona, he was definately -way- to touchy, and suspicious for his likings. He didn't know who this woman was, but he didn't want her to become prey to some molestor.* - Sun Nov 29 02:44:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) eyes narrowed upon Tengoku, he took a deep breath. His grasp on his blade remaining the same as Tengoku spoke to him. He didn't reply, his gaze found Tengoku's own,he didn't trust this guy. Not at all, his blade was unclipped from it's strap, and the tip hit the ground, causing a subtle crack on the cement to occur. * - Sun Nov 29 02:57:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) kicked off his hind leg, he wasn't enjoying this male's behavior. And his persistence to want to touch this woman, was kind of startling. He approached Asteroth's side, and pivoted, his blade held upwards, towards Tengoku's body, but it seemed like Abraxas had this handled for the most part. Although he didn't lower his guard, his hands held his hilt tightly, preparing for any need to counter attack.* - Sun Nov 29 03:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Anyone of relevance that got hurt? - Sun Nov 29 22:38:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: She got hit b-by this dragon made of w-water....And got her lower half ripped o-off before being dragged away... - Sun Nov 29 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Oh. That's all? - Sun Nov 29 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Stop stuttering Dammnit! - Sun Nov 29 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Take a deep breath.. - Sun Nov 29 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Focus... - Sun Nov 29 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Y-Yes Ma'am. - Sun Nov 29 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: You did it again! - Sun Nov 29 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked up to her as she looked displeased, "I-I'll serve you t-the best I-I can A-Asteroth-sama." He stated, before proceeding to bow his head, his heart was racing just from stringing those words together, he would've taken notice of how  what she said sounded if he wasn't feeling so 'outclassed'.* - Sun Nov 29 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) stared at her feet, when she spoke to him, he swallowed hard as he spoke "I-I'm an aspiring Swordsman....I-I'm also skilled in the lightning affinity which I use as a supplement...For my sword's cutting power..." He stated,  "I-I know I don't h-have your trust...But I hope...To g-gain it through my work." He stated with his head bowed.* - Sun Nov 29 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) nodded his head as he reached for the hilt of his sword. He took a deep breath and inhaled. As he held it in his hand, he stood upright, his eyes closed, as his sword hand was extended towards the gate in front of him. The tip aimed at the gate, and his left hand moved over to grasp his forearm, and his chakra surged. Lightning began to ignite around the length of his blade.When he reopened his eyes, his mind was consumed with the thoughts of Eri and Ortho's death. A deep hatred appeared in his stomach. As his hand shot forward towards the gate. The movement was swift and fluid. As the swordcut through the gate as easy as if it was paper.

He pulled back, and another diagnol slash was sent towards the gate forming an X, with his strikes. But he continued onwards, following the path of his swing, the tip of his sword was stabbed into the cement below them, and with an elegant and grace movment, he was balanced atop the hilt of his blade. His foot shot out aimed towards the epicenter of the X he had made with his two cuts. And the wood cracked as his foot hit it, and was shot backwards towards the tree. As he landed on the ground, his chakra flow to his blade was ceased, and he returned to kneeling before Asteroth...But that hate he had demonstrated hadn't quite been...Suppressed like it had been before. He had a desire to avenge the deaths of Eri....And Ortho...But his target...Had already been claimed...And that made him all the more angrier.* - Sun Nov 29 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) as she spoke, he took a deep breath expecting her judgement to be hard...Possibly dissapproving of his talents. But when she spoke, that he wasn't to bad...That he could potentially become great---Against his nature his excitement began to show---And when she mentioned food. His eyes widened, as he looked up to her. He was really excited to have actual food for once, his mouth was practically watering. "T-Thank you Asteroth-sama! I won't let you down!"* - Sun Nov 29 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: I wonder. . Would this mke him easier to manipulate or would his hatred make him resistant? - Sun Nov 29 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) watched as she moved by him, almost as elegantly as an angel to his own mind. And when she passed him, his eyes moved to her hips which swayed with a subtle gait. His cheeks flushed red for a moment, as his gaze shifted off to the side. He stood, and began following behind her. "A-Anything y-you're willing to buy L-Lady Asteroth...I'm not picky." He stated bowing his head to her, of course he aimed to open the door for her to pass he did mind his manners.* - Mon Nov 30 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) approached the seat across from her taking notice of her wiping down the table and chair...He decided if he was to serve her it'd be wise to be able to do that for her even if it wasn't a requirement. He bowed is head to her in thanks, and he looked towards her, before shifting uncomfortable as his gaze met the table before him. 

"I-I was looking....f-for work..T-To make money and g-get more experience.." He stated in a 'shy', but almost servantly manner.* - Mon Nov 30 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) blinked as she spoke about not recalling his name and his eyes widened. "S-Sorry for m-my Manners! M-Menma!" He declared, as he leaned to bow his head, and overshot his bow, and his his head on the table. "O-Ow.." He stated rubbing his forehead, as his cheeks turned a faint red, he had made a fool of himself before Asteroth. "Y-Yes...power...T-Then...I'll be a-able to achieve the r-rest.." He spoke in a light tone, still shifting uncomfortably in his seat. "I-I'm prepared t-to do whatever I c-can to build t-trust and p-prove my loyalty." He stated, keeping his head bowed and his gaze on the table too nervous to look up to Asteroth.* - Mon Nov 30 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Alright then. We can train together soon. - Mon Nov 30 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: T-Thanks A-Asteroth-sama.. - Mon Nov 30 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I may have a few remedies.. - Mon Nov 30 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: To help draw out latent power. - Mon Nov 30 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That is, if you can trust me. - Mon Nov 30 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Latent...power.... - Mon Nov 30 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 30 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath as he sat upon the ground, he considered how to gain power quickly and efficiently and luckily he had the former Mizukage's back of scrolls. Taking a deep breath he sat upon the ground as he exhaled sharply ,cracking his knuckles. As his sword was pulled from his waist,and placed upon his lap. Taking a deep breath he focused.

This technique was labled Lightning ball, and he realised from the getgo it was a technique that could be channeled through his sword...It made it appealing to him. Since it was a sealless technique he could fire it on the fly making for a deadly combo in battle, he was excited to have the opportunity to learn such a thing and his tongue ran across his lips, he cracked his knuckles and focused upon the scroll which laid before him.

He nodded his head, these would be excellent in battle as he continued reading, it was only a matter of successfully learning it, he knew it'd be a small hassle but it was something he was willing to do. So he took a deep breath and inhaled followed by a deep exhale. He wondered how he would advance himself in the comming days but Asteroth said she had a way to help him grow in power.

He felt inclined to believe in her words, so he focused, taking a deep breath  he looked around, with a yawn. A single hand was ushered through his hair. His gaze shifted to the tree and back to what he was doing, as he reached for his sword, curling his fingers around the hilt. He began sending his chakra into it, and it surged at the tip, of the blade. Taking a deep breath as lightning surrounded his blade.

He smiled, as he swung it, and the ball of lightning shot from his blade, being sent towards the gate, and when it collided it broke right through it, striking a tree before it lost it's power and dispersed he panted subtly. "Wow..." He muttered, with a gentle grin he had managed to achieve another great technique for his arsenal, and that made him happy.* - Mon Nov 30 02:34:27 2015
