He was fairly strong and had a decent amount of stamina to back up his efforts. After he was done he'd stand looking towards Eiyu:

"Well then. I already know this. I believe." He stated, channeling chakra into the soles of his feet before running a few paces up the wall and jumping off.* - Fri Dec 11 01:19:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath as he sighed he figured it'd be inevitable for his training to progress he had slacked off due to poor timing, so all that was left was to pick up. So he took a deep and slowly he began unraveling the scroll and he set his gaze upon the paper and he began to read "By creating a spark from their hands, this technique allows the user to throw multiple balls of flames, which are able to either cause fiery explosions on impact or set the target on fire."

He found that fairly interesting to say the least, he cracked his knuckles and smiled this technique was seal-less,  meaning in battle it'd be ideal and perfect. HE wouldn't have to waste times utilizing handsseals, he'd be able to focus completely on making a difference in a fight, with the plus from using no handeals, he'd be able to focus completely on the battle making him a force to be reckoned with.

He had time, a lot of it, and that made him nervous time would dull his senses he had to focus on what laid before him in order to move to the next step, as much as he desired to improve. Part of him wondered what would happen next, but he figured all would be unveiled to him in due time. So he yawned to himself, and cracked his knuckles,  his gaze focused on the surrounding areas and he wondered what exactly was next.* - Sat Dec 12 11:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath as he yawned himself, as he unraveled the next scroll in his aresnal this one was a bit more unique than he had seen before, cracking his knuckles he relaxed on the ground, as he unraveled the scroll he began to read or rather begin the decipher the language which was in the scroll written by the former Mizukage it was an interesting so he began reading slowly he yawned taking a deep breath as he began to read from the scroll.

"Iron Maiden"

He took a deep breath and sighed as he began to read "The user performs the required seals before placing their hands flat upon the ground. Iron chains are then spawned from the ground and shoot up around the individual whom they are targetting. These chains then wrap around and constrict the target."  That was a very valuable technique he figured it'd be great for use in battle so he wondered if there were any practical applications for the technique.

He smiled briefly, this was definately going to be fun, so he'd have to continue his training without delay, he needed to advance and this was a great way to do just that, so as time persisted he had to increase the amount of power he had at his disposal through any means neccessary. Through learning this technique he had added yet another great technique to his books, that had unknown potential.* - Sat Dec 12 11:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) yawned briefly, he had two techniques which required handseals he was a bit perplexed but at least his aresenal wasn't excessively over-run, most of his other abilities were seal-less, so that was progress, he yawned to himself and sighed, the next scroll was known as Wind Release: Rotating shuriken, so he figured this would be an interesting technique to learn in the comming days, so as he sat down, he began to read the scroll taking his time.

He traced his finger along the beginning of the text before reading "This technique infuses wind-natured chakra into bladed weapons. The user can then manipulate the blades in a spinning manner to attack the target." After that was all said and done, he figured this would be a fairly easy technique to perform and apply in the midst of battle so he chuckled to himself, he never thought looting a Kage would be so rewarding.

But that was a plus since he had all this stuff within his grasp, with a gentle yawn he figured it was around time to move onto the next technique, he wondered how many he should knock out over the course of the week, he sighed to himself, this was a fairly basic technique, so he was content with having learned it, that made him happy on a moderate level, but since another technique was done he could move on.* - Sat Dec 12 11:40:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) was walking through the hallway, and happened to turn the corner, as his gaze fell upon the Anbu figure. His hand reached for the hilt of his Katana, and he stared at the male, he didn't know what the goal was for this match. But he figured out he'd find out what it was soon enough, assuming he survived that long, he had absolutely no clue who the male was.* - Sat Dec 12 18:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) honestly had no intention of waiting for the male to attack him, since apparently this was a death match, such information would've been --insanely useful if he had been granted this information moments before being summoned. With the attempt to make a single handseal, he'd aim to vanish from his current position, in a sudden explosion of smoke, and head back the way he had come, he didn't wish to engage himself in a figtht, this was definately problematic.  But he had no intention of waiting for the agent to attack.

Had he managed to complete this seal as the male turned to faced him after noticing him, hopefully during the period in time he had acknowledged who he was he would've been gone. * - Sat Dec 12 18:59:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) felt the concussive force from the truly massive explosion which had occured before him, which was more than enough to uproot him, and send him skidding backwards fairly easy. He hit the ground and grunted as he hit the ground and rolled for a bit. But no actual harm had befell his person, and he quickly scurried to his feet, his hand reached for his Katana as he looked towards Kami and Kyubishu.  He grunted subtly "Man...That's insane.." He muttered, as his fingers tightly curled around the hilt of his blade, he was a little roughed up...But hell he'd survive....Probably. * - Sat Dec 12 19:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) since he had taken this time to gather his bearings he was prepared mostly. So his hands were raised to chest level from a distance, and he made a series of handseals, before dropping to his knees, with his palms flat against the ground, he'd attempt to make quick work of Kami, and had decided to bind him first, while he was reveling in success, though he absolutely hated doing such underhanded things, it seemed like it was an inevitable thing, the male had shown great strength that he was somewhat nervous about facing directly, he didn't wish to die an untimely death not that he would even if he lost this particular fight.

Though after doing said task his hand immediately grasped his tanto as he made his way closer to the male, taking care to avoid touching the water.* - Sat Dec 12 19:57:36 2015

Slowly he ran forward, though he stopped at the edge of the water. He didn't wish to run between the two surfaces, from what he had seen he could assume the male utilized fire release...But, on the off chance he utilized water as well, he didn't wish to get captured by water dragons. 

His gaze fell on the man, but he didn't say anything, not yet, he was if anything an honorable fighter. "You, I wish to fight you, But do you have any current injuries? I do not wish to fight an injured man." He stated holding his Katana prepared for some sort of attack to be launched.* - Sat Dec 12 20:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) wasted absolutely no time playing around with this, chakra surged around his blade unlike his opponent he aimed to take advantage of reduced time though using seal-less techniques he wasn't -too- concerned about the ring of fire blocking his path, But the lightning gathered at the tip of his blade, causing the development of a small ball of electricity, following the arc of his -extremely- fast swing, the ball was propelled forward directly at Kami with the intention of igniting the gas a fair distance away from him, or perhaps meeting the male half-way, whilst jumping backwards. Taking care not to leap  into the flames, because he had believed that had he timed it correctly the explosion would've taken place over the water, and hopefully would send a large amount of water his way which would disable part of the flames so that he'd be able to back up further, he figured this plan would work. Although there was some distance, he should've been able to at least see the raising of Kami's hands to make seals, if not able to completely deduce he was forming seals it'd be the first logical conclusion since this was a large death match.* - Sat Dec 12 20:41:58 2015

There wasn't a body, only a bunch of tiny bones scattered across the ground. That was all there was to 'Menma' or whatever replacement had been used to take his place in this scouting venture.

He had accomplished his goal for the most part, and that was great he was excited, to have made such progress, not only that he got to test a fairly interesting technique of his own. And Kami was definately interesting, but it was becomming painfully obvious he wasn't as strong as he should be to be participating in this, he was honestly contemplating waiting the rest of this match out in silence where he was perched at.* - Sat Dec 12 21:09:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) shook his head, and the moment she moved to shift her hands upwards, with a sudden spurt of speed his hand was pulled back, and a quick yet powerful chop aimed for her neck. He wasn't a fool and he had definately anticipated something like this happening, he was anything but a fool. The strike was powerful enough to knock her head first against the wall aiming to further the attempt to knock her down, he wasn't sure if he should kill her or not, though it was definately against his code to do so, but she was probably unconcious unless she could react.* - Sat Dec 12 22:39:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) was wearing a Jacket atop of his shirt---So biting through to flesh would be extremely hard, and his chop would probably make contact, rendering her attempt to seal him, almost impossible due to the time and preparation needed to place such a high ranking seal, and if he was a clone, the damage wasn't enough to cause him to disperse at all.* - Sat Dec 12 23:03:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took the edge of one of the chains and stabbed it into the wall, hanging her by the chain, so she was like a cacoon. The clone then peered around the edge, looking to see what was occuring.* - Sat Dec 12 23:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) was currently, utilizing Suimen at the back of the cave, he stood upside down, his body prepared for a fight tensed and focused on the area, he would've been setting up tags along the ceiling, or rather just finishing said task. Leaving a safe distance between him and the tags to avoid collateral. Damage, But he took notice of the male named Kami the moment he rounded the corner, and his hands met, and he made a series of handseals. Pressing his palm gently against the ceiling of the cave, and as he did so three crows appeared---Then six---then Fifty----Eighty--So forth so on and etcetera. Flying around the cave and towards Iwatobi at an accelerated rate. 

The crows were fast, and were much like a horde concealing sight further into the cave, as they pressed onwards. He wasn't sure who the individual was, but he certainly intended to deal with them before the situation became problematic.* - Sat Dec 12 23:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) since apparently he wouldn't have noticed movement directly in front of him, for whatever reason not even the faintest registration on his accursed eyes of movement. But he saw black smoke racing towards him, his hand raised towards one of the tags and he discharged a single ball of fire, aiming to hit one of the explosive tags, and create a chain reaction which would hopefully ignite the smoke long before it got to him, and maybe even cause a cave in atop of Kami.

But, few things happened as they should maybe the tags were faulty. I mean otherwise, he's dead.* - Sun Dec 13 00:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) arms raised over his face, as the explosion rocked the cave, knocking him back aainst the wall if not completely through the wall. He felt the heat against his body the pain as his flesh was charred. The feeling of his back hitting the wall, released a loud crack. And he went wide-eyed, as the explosion continued around him, the constant pelt of the explosion radiating within his ears and then---Silence. It was quiet all of it...There wasn't a sound not here nor there. His body hurt---Or perhaps it didn't depending on the scale of his burns.

If he wasn't dead, he was definately near it. His clothes were probably for the most part burned off, and he'd probably fall into the water---maybe helping his case as well as harming him. The cold water cooling his burns, but regardless he probably wasn't in any condition to fight. Even with his higher speed or recovery, that explosion was absolutely nothing to scuff at, he was lucky to be alive, he didn't even assess his injuries, he had put all his remaining energy...How ever trivial it may be. To staying alive---If he was even able to move. 

He couldn't escape that feeling, that he'd die..Here and now, his body was no doubt riddled with cuts as well as burns, bleeding from parts of his skin, he felt the heat coursing through his body. "I'm dying...Aren't I?" He thought to himself, as his vision blurred for a moment.* - Sun Dec 13 00:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) looked up towards the surface, as he sunk further into the depths of the water, his gaze found the rocks falling into the water, and his hand extended towards the surface, as his vision continued to blur. "Mita...." He thought, his heart was racing but was slowing by the minute "I...I...Don't want to die." He thought to himself, if he wasn't in water tears would've began to form in his eyes, as his hand reached for the surface...But he was to far away. "I...I want to live...!" He thought to himself.

Willing his body to move, to do something he didn't feel pain anymore, every fiber of his being...Wanted to survive, he was scared and he was terrified. "Why...Why do I have to die...? Why now...? What about Mita?" He thought to himself, as his scarlet eyes gazed at the rocks above him, which had slowed their descent after hitting the water. He felt the energy leaving his body. "Please...I...Just want....a little bit more time...." He pleaded, with whatever god it was he worshipped...Whatever god was listening.

"Just...let me live!" He begged.

He was terrified of death, or maybe it was the darkness which was surrounding him, he felt that...Unsettled hate rising from his core. "Am I...really...going to die...Without avenging their deaths..? Hatsujin...Eri...." He thought to himself, "I'm...going to fail them....Let them down..." That thought hurt him the most, "I...don't want to fail them...." But in that moment, he realised something about himself.

He was selfish.* - Sun Dec 13 00:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) just as his vision had darkened---"I'm dying...I won't.....survive...I won't be able to say goodbye..." He was on the brink of giving up, his eyes had begun to close. And when they had closed fully, he had accepted his situation, or maybe it was the inevitabilty. But something changed....In that final moment, before he gave in...Accepted it...He felt...regret.. His desire to live overpowered his body's fatigue...And he -willed- himself, to move,his eyes flared open, and his scarlet eyes locked on with a focus which should've been impossible for him.

His body...It was numb, there was no pain...Everything was silent...Yet...He seemed...more alert than before...His fist clenched, and slowly he began working his arms, swimming forward, some how....Thanks to whatever god had been there, he was moving, it was almost inhumane. But when he reached the edge of the water, he was probably at a new part of the cavern which had opened up as per the explosion. 

And placing his hand on the surface, he slumped over, with half his body on the ground and half in the water. His breathing was rigid, his heart raised, and he was out of breath, his vision was shakey....He didn't know what this was, it was unexplainable...But he just...Laid, there in silence, there wasn't any pain, there wasn't any uncomfortability. He was there, without being there, he was fatigued to the point which should've been impossible.

He should've been dead. But he wasn't. Why had he survived? He asked himself this---But had he really survived? Or had fate just decided to give him a crueler way to die.* - Sun Dec 13 01:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) took a deep breath, as he resumably began to come to, his body ached...But the pain told him he was alive. He did a quick limb check which consisted of clenching and unclenching his hands a few times, before moving his legs, as he struggled to get to his feet he was a bit shakey at first, but he looked around. He was hurt, but...Somehow he had survived, and he bit his lower lip, he figured he'd need to Wrap his wounds. Most of his body was...burned but not drastically so. 

And slowly he took a deep breath and sighed, a majority of his wounds had been healed...That was good. But he raised his hands to chest level, and made a few handseals before creating a single clone this one was made of crows. He figured this would be ideal, and the main body followed his clone from the ceiling, taking care to move slow to avoid immediate detection.* - Sun Dec 13 15:38:36 2015
