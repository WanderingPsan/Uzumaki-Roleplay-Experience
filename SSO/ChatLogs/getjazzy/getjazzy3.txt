<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) proceeded to strain his muscles. He'd suddenly enter his "overdrive" mode, starting to pump his right arm quicker. His muscles within said arm would tense. Glistening perspiration dripped away from his rather, well-toned form. He was durable physically, and his body was well built, though he lacked the physical power, momentum and reaction time. Thus, the green individual was trying to incline his efficiency in all areas with his immense training.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) stroked his chin, smiling when he adopted an idea. The male would hop up in front of her.

"Mirai-chan! Trade spots with me on Squad Ravenscrotum!" He'd state, referring to his squad with Trilliam, Lera and Koji as the leader.

"My youth will carry me along the way of growing as a shinobi! There is no harm in me going without a squad!"* - Mon Oct  5 01:54:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) drifted his beaty gaze toward Mirai.

"This is your opportunity to bloom, Mirai-chan; however if you wish not, I have no right to change your ideas." He'd state, starting to stretch his legs, his hand pressing to the knee corresponding leg. Izutora redirected his attention to Ichiro.

"I am afraid that my body is attuned to my typical training preferences. My normal training methods are most effective! I wish not to, but I must decline!"* - Mon Oct  5 02:05:26 2015

"Your youth is empowered by your clothing, miss." He'd state.* - Mon Oct  5 02:09:42 2015

"In that case, if that day comes, I may have to be here to stop you. I won't let you harm my comrades without proving how passionate my burning youth is!" He'd exclaim, practically on his heels.* - Mon Oct  5 02:37:52 2015

"Youngling, regroup your bearings. There's no need for discontent."* - Mon Oct  5 02:48:57 2015

"Cheer up, young miss! I am here for you, and so is Sunagakure! Overcome your pains with your burning youth!"* - Mon Oct  5 03:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) slid his legs from under him, folding his left arm behind his back and pressing his right palm to the ground below. He'd start ascending and descending with each pump and bend of his right arm. "If I cannot accomplish one hundred and twenty, it shall become two hundred and fourty." He'd murmur. The bushy brow'd individual would continue performing pushups at an expeditious rate of three a second.

"I must get stronger... I could physically see the gap in strength between myself and that red haired individual! I will seek him out and prove that my cowardice is trumped by my youth! That is my pledge as the Green Beast of Sunagakure!"* - Mon Oct  5 03:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) peered back at the girl on his hundredth pushup, perceiving the change in her outlook of things. Whether it was because of him or not, the male continued to work with great finesse. Sweat was slowly beginning to drip from his frame, but that didn't slow down the momentum he had behind his pushups at all. He'd continue preaching about youth and it's benefit to his growth in taijutsu as he performed the pushups, counting them between said statements.

The moment he reached one hundred and twenty pushups he'd begin bouncing on his heels, his arms slightly arched and his hands balled into tight fists. He'd punch rapidly, alternating between left and right jabs as he did so. The bushy browed jumpsuit rocking male would continue to thrust at the air in front of him.

"Two hundred and fifty punches in the next minute. If I cannot do those it's five hundred in thirty seconds!" He'd shout, the bowlcut-loving taijutsu specialist hollared.* - Mon Oct  5 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: That man was an exception! Next time I see him my growth shall be astounding. If anyone intends to hurt my comrades they'll face the wrath of my burning, youthful fury! - Mon Oct  5 03:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) halted the movement of his fist, glancing at her with a raising of one of his two-inch thick brows. The male would hop into a handstand. He was subconsciously training and shouting about youth in front of her to cheer her up. One way or another he wasn't aware of the efficiency of his own actions and gestures of kindness. Izutora would hop onto into a handstand, attempting to rotate while in said handstand.

It was apparent that he wasn't coming on her trip back to the courtyard.* - Mon Oct  5 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) pressed his hand firmly against the ground, pushing out of the handstand and landing standing straight. The bowlcut accentuating individual would sprint toward the academy, taking a great leap and extending his right leg out, his left leg arched. He'd proceed to flying sidekick the side of the building, then backflip throughout the air, landing in a crouch. He'd race off toward the courtyard, arms thrown behind him.* - Mon Oct  5 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) arrived at the courtyard in a sprint, skidding to a stop to peer at his surroundings.* - Mon Oct  5 03:47:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) approached Mirai while doing a handstand.

"Lord Hassan stated that you specialize in your clan's abilities! Can you make giant spheres of chakra like Koji-sensei does?" He'd question rather exuberantly.* - Mon Oct  5 03:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) hopped off of the bench. The male would extend his legs out beneath him, folding his left arm behind his back. He pressed his right palm to the ground below him, suspending the entirety of his rather toned, yet physical strength-lacking frame. The bushy browed male would proceed to bend his arm completely until he was only an inch from touching the earth, at which point he'd pump his arm outward.

"Three hundred in a minute! If I cannot accomplish those it shall be six hundred!" Izutora exclaimed with burning passion in his pair of beaty irises. He started doing the pushups quicker, performing four in a second.* - Mon Oct  5 11:48:16 2015

He'd state his typical phrase while training like this; "If I cannot complete three hundred, I'll make it six hundred! All in the name of youth!" Izutora shouted, inclining the momentum that he performed the pushups.

The male would ascend to a rate of four pushups a meer second.* - Mon Oct  5 20:12:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) stood to his feet, breahting midlly. The male would suddenly leap into the air, cartwheeling over Katsune's figure then shooting forth behind her. Izutora would pass by the violet haired girl, thrusting his right leg outward and striking the air rapidly, then proceeding to whip around three hundred and sixty degrees, following up with a kick from the opposing kick. Using his buoyancy to his advantage he would twirl once more while airborn.

He'd flying sidekick the air, his foot thrashing against the earth as he descent within the kick.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) had already tied himself up inadvertently with his own forearm gauze, because he was struggling to release himself from the snakes. He kinda chilled after that, simply staring.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) gets fucking SUPLEXED. He'd lay on the ground for five seconds, still as ever. Suddenly the male would struggle to his feet, his arms hanging in front of him as he stared at the six foot tall individual that just dropped him.

"O-Owwww... that hurt..." He'd state, rubbing his back.* - Tue Oct  6 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) took the punch directly, stumbling back from the blow, but not enough to run into Hideki. The male would stand straight up, extending his right arm out and folding his left behind his back. He cuffed his fingers together within his right hand, his head shifted to face Amon.

"If you wish to see my youth, I'll gladly show it to you!" He'd exclaim, sprinting forward at a pace that was average for his experience as a shinobi. The male would suddenly spin, pivoting on his foot and attempting to smash the sole of his right foot against the male's chest. He'd take yet another rotation, then proceed to attempt thrashing his left foot against Amon's chest in the same area.

"Leaf Whirlwind!"* - Tue Oct  6 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I wonder how Amon got his lycanthropic ability... - Tue Oct  6 02:14:24 2015
