"Three.. two.. one.. fightinthenameofyouth!" He exclaimed exuberantly, shoving his hand down from his backpouch and exposing a kunai, which he whipped toward her. It wasn't direct at all, and if anything he intended to distract her with it.

The kunai -zipped- through the air. (That shit's moving at 9 tiles a turn afterall.)

Whether she was distracted or not, the male thrusted forth, bounding off of the earth and spinning three hundred and sixty degrees, before attempting to flying sidekick her in the chest.

"Dynamic Entry!"

(20 Damage. 13 Attack Speed)* - Thu Nov 12 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) seemed to notice her reaction. That was a good sign. It meant that he didn't have to hold back. The male would take the strike completely, but there was literally no damage caused by the attack landing. His left leg jabbed forth, intending to smash into her stomach. The raw power behind his attacks was appauling when he wasn't half-assing them.

Judging by how much damage she'd take, she may or may not have released him from her grasp. But if she did, he would slam his feet into the earth, aiming to charge forth and kick her in the chin to knock her into the air.

"Creeping... Leaf.. Shadow!"

(40 Damage.)* - Thu Nov 12 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) was thrown away from her. He flew back, landing on the ground and sliding across it. He stood up, shaking the grains of sand out of his head. The male folded his left arm behind his back, extending his right arm out in front of him and bending it slightly.

His back palm faced her, and he shifted his cuffed-together fingers back and forth, urging her to make her approach.

"Do not hold back, if you are holding back! I'd wish to see how strong you are!" He'd state. Judging by that kendo stance he assumed that she was relatively experienced with swordsmanship.

The male stood straight, smiling genuinely, as well as confidently.* - Thu Nov 12 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) bent his knees, then he rushed directly at her.

Izutora jetted his left leg out, aiming to kick her directly in the chin with enough power put behind the attack to knock her airborn.

If such an attack was successful, he'd take the initiative to try and align his body with hers, while corkscrewing throughout the mid-air behind her.* - Thu Nov 12 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) had been dashing forward, suddenly met by not chakra.. but pure, raw darkness manifested by some type of energy. He wasn't pushed back, though a minor cut forming across his mid-section as a small bit of blood was drawn.

"Creeping Leaf Shadow!"

His leg redirected to stop her forehead from taking the blow. He had reacted -EXTRA- fast because he didn't want to cause her brain-damage or anything with such an attack.

His foot aimed to smack into her chin and send her airborn, after being redirected of course!* - Thu Nov 12 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: That was close! It almost ripped the stitches! - Thu Nov 12 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) shot upright, spinning rapidly while in the air. Unfortunately, it seemed that she'd curled into a ball, making what he intended to do unable to be done. He aligned himself with her body.

Instead of doing what he was originally going to do, the male thrusted his right arm out.

His fist loosened into an open-hand, as he slapped the -shit- out of her upper back, like that friend that everyone has that pats your back harder than they really should.

"YOUTH!"* - Thu Nov 12 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: What dat mouf doooo..... - Thu Nov 12 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) was doing anything possible to stop himself from getting stabbed in the stomach. He -never- wanted to experience pain like that again. None the less, there was nothing to do in this situation, but somersault rapidly throughout midair.

He then came to a halt and thrust his right leg downward, the katana's tip thrusting through and slashing his sandal... only to... slide off of the sole of his foot... like butter.

"Hyaaaaaaah!"* - Thu Nov 12 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) smiled, giving her a thumbs up. He cheesed brighter than he did before, one of his teeth shining brightly.

"You are an admirable swordswoman!" * - Thu Nov 12 05:00:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: ...But I didn't hit him in the leg... - Thu Nov 12 05:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) pointed to his stomach. There were stitches near his waist.

"I gained this injury.. in addition to a bad injury to my leg from a dual-wielding swordsman. I must go take some medicine for my leg..!"* - Thu Nov 12 05:09:45 2015

"I apologize. I was simply excited to see you!" He stated, as exuberant as ever. His tone was a little more down to earth to avoid startling her, as he seemed to have previously done.* - Thu Nov 19 01:11:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) crouched down beside the crucifix, his right palm pressed against the top. The male stared silently, before speaking.

"I will live as the legacy of your youth! I ensure to you that I will protect the village as you did. It's my obligation as the Green Beast."

"I apologize on behalf of my own foolishness that I never took the time to befriend you! I feel as though we could've been something better than side-by-side acquintances who didn't know one another's name on the battlefield."

He stood up, throwing his right arm into the air and slamming his eyes shut, his hand balled into a tight fist. One tear drained from each of his eyes, not a single sound resonating from him. His mouth parted.

"If there's one regret I'll forever hold in life, it'll be never getting to know you."

His arm fell to his side, his eyes opening as he said one last thing.

"May you rest in peace."

His hands slid into his pockets as he walked back to his chair.

<No one's immortal. Thousands of shinobi die day by day, whether they're in our nation or someone else's. If I want to move on I must remember that..> He thought to himself.* - Fri Nov 20 03:13:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) stepped into the vicinity, watching as balls ricocheted throughout the area. One thrusted directly into his side, swiveling against the side of his torso, still rotating rapidly as it grinded against him before bounding off of his side not even a moment later. He showed no visible reaction. It seemed that the ball did no damage.

"A training regime?" He stated, beginning to perform leg stretches as he continued to ignore the balls as they made firm contact with him.* - Sat Nov 21 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) sprinted onto the scene, his arms thrown behind him. His gaze was set upon the army that himself and many other Sunagakure shinobi were approaching. He stayed alert, hoping to anticipate whatever may come from rushing into battle without strategy. He maintained a position near the frontlines, bracing himself for whatever may come.* - Mon Nov 23 21:33:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) stood and watched with his arms folded. A close-combat specialist such as himself was incapable of getting in close contact with the opponent regardless.* - Mon Nov 23 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Oh they're running off. - Mon Nov 23 23:18:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) bent his knees. Izutora thrusted forth at the speed that he seemed to attain from sufficient time spent training. The black-haired male intended to pursue the army that had begun to flee. He rushed to the frontlines, bypassing the rest of the army as he had his own plans up his sleeve. For now, he wanted to close the distance between himself and the fleeing attackers.* - Mon Nov 23 23:33:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) rushed forth, coming to a stop near Muhammed, astonished by the sheer force of what the Kazekage had up his sleeve.

"I... don't know... it's.. so youthful!" He remarked. He was eager to see what the assailant's response would be to this confrontation. Izutora was practically on his heels, waiting for something else to happen.* - Tue Nov 24 00:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) folded his left arm behind his back, extending his right arm out, his back, cuffed palm facing the area in front of him. Izutora bent his knees, clenching his teeth as he witnessed what Edge had in plan; the total destruction of Sunagakure's army. "I refuse to be a bystander... even if this is in vain... I refuse to let this happen without trying to prevent it!" He exclaimed, regardless of whom heard him.

<I love you Zephira. Don't let my demise bring you down into the dumps!>

He raced forward, rushing through the ranks before bending his knees more and bounding off of the earth, thrusting his right leg outward with intentions of flying sidekicking Edge dead in the face.

"I won't sit and watch you destroy the village I care about! This is my last pledge, as the Green Beast of Sunagakure!"* - Tue Nov 24 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) whispers: (---) - Tue Nov 24 01:21:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) | |

And there it was.

The male flying side-kicked directly into a dozen flaming-shurikens. He was scraped up, but that was an understatement. The shurikens pierced his flesh while all the while enflaming it, giving him a quick, yet very painful death.

All the while, the male fought through it with his ongoing battlecry, which lowered as he burned to death cruely. It seemed he'd made an example out of what this second Edge was capable of. His dying thoughts were associated with Zephira, and a sudden feeling of regret for abandoning her like this.

In addition, it seemed that all of his training was for nothing. The Green Beast died a rash-man that ran headfirst into situations without thinking it over. While he wanted to die as a cause of Sunagakure, he died an example.
