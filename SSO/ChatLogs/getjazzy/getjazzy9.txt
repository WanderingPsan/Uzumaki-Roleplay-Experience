<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) bent his knees, standing within a crouch. He'd proceed to stretch his arms out from his sides, before shooting directly at the wall. In an exuberant burst of speed the male would proceed to flail his right leg forth, his foot smashing against the wall.

The sheer power put behind the attack was enough to make the wall crumble around his foot, leaving a hole that was half a foot in length within the border. The male would thrust his other foot upright, propelling away from the wall, soaring backward throughout the air and allowing his figure to begin spinning forward in place, before he swung his legs outward, standing straight up.

Izutora would fold his left arm behind his back, extending his right arm outward with his palm facing the wall and his legs lagging the horse-stance format of leg positioning that typical taijutsu stances possessed. The slickback-haired taijutsu specialist rushed forth, proceeding to leap upright and spin around rapidly.

He'd drive his right leg outward, smashing the sole of his foot against the surface of the earthen wall. He'd suddenly thrust his other leg outward, proceeding to barrage the wall with a series of kicks, his arms thrown back behind him. He'd kick off the wall formation, having left a crater from his kicks. A small plume of smoke parted from where he kicked rapidly. He'd twirl backward throughout midair, landing on the ground. His arms took the same positioning, though his legs were extended out in a horse-esque leg formation this time around.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) clenched his teeth, allowing a graceful smile to accentuate his facial features. With a flash of one of his teeth, he'd sprint forward rapidly. The male would leap high into the air, spinning as he did so. In a flurry of rotations and somersaults while soaring high in the air as he descended down toward the border of the training field, he'd shout.

"Leaf Great Whirlwind!"

Breaking away from his spin, he'd suddenly bash his foot into the wall, aiming low, then sliding his heel along the wall and performing yet another gyration throughout the air, maintaining buoyancy as he aimed higher with his next kick, performed by his other foot. He'd spin again, doing a much higher kick than initially. With a small gathering of the rocks caving in on themselves, he'd take advantage of his height in the air compared to the wall itself, proceeding to perform one last spin and practically shove his leg through the stone as though it was butter, leaving a line five inches into the wall where he kicked.

He'd plant his foot against the ground, taking a leap back.* - Sun Nov  1 01:16:22 2015

Now saying that he was expaecting her to move the shuriken and set some wires on fire is defintely a stretch.  He ain't see that shit coming, but he knew that she had something up her sleeve.  The fire being enhanced by the wind was not something that Hiroshi wanted to get caught by.  He had very little time to react, but he had some impressive reflexes and hoped that he was quick enough to do what he needed to to get the hell out of the way.  He would quickly put up a seal and dip into the ground with impressive speed.  He had a very good control of this jutsu so he was able to do this relatively quickly.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) moved forth at a rapid pace of speed. He'd leap high into the air, proceeding to gyrate seven hundred and twenty degrees before thrusting his right leg out. With firm aim he smashed the sole of his foot against the wall of the border of Sunagakure, making sure he didn't use all of his strength. The part of the wall he struck looked as though it had been slightly punctured by a very thick, sharp weapon, which was really just the slickback haired male's foot, and that was only a small section of his hand-to-hand combat prowess. There were several cracks within the wall around the part that he sidekicked. He pulled his leg back, bouncing back on his feet.

sprinted forward faster than before, intending to train his speed, in addition to his reaction time. With that being said, he directed his foot in a perfect arc so that sections of the wall would crumble down, falling down toward him. As his foot contacted the earth, a crack ran up the vicinity, and several more fissures came to be. Sections of the rock toppled down toward him, and since there was little to no distance between Izutora and the rock, he had to be quick, very quick. The male reflexively shot to the right, but wasn't quick enough.

jetted his arms out, releasing a barrage of punches to destroy the incoming rocks falling down toward him. As he did so he glided across the ground, sliding across like a baseball player trying to reach fourth base in the knick of time. He just barely escaped the largest of the stone that'd fallen upon the ground, standing to his feet. Despite this being rigorous on some people, he wasn't tired out at all. Izutora would bend his knees, proceeding to leap high into the air and release a barrage of punches at the air in front of him.

continued to move at an expeditious rate of momentum throughout the air, providing himself with buoyancy by constantly spinning after each kick that he launched into the air. Each kick was aimed higher than the last, but instead of it being three low to mid to high kicks, there was less of a gap between the range. Essentially, three kicks alone were low, then three were medium, then three were high. In total, he'd performed nine spins. Despite the dizziness, he kept on going on with his training regime. His midair expedition would end with a dropping of his weight applied to his right leg, which was raised over his head.* - Tue Nov  3 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thrusted his right leg down when he was only seconds from landing, smashing his heel upon the earth and causing a massive amount of sand to thrust away from around him. A crater was left in the area where he'd inflicted with his raw hand-to-hand combat power. He still seemed to be untired. The male would extend his right leg out to his side, bending his left leg completely and then proceeding to lean down on it. He'd inch back some, then move in the direction of his left leg, stretching his right leg as he did so, by trying to extend it as far as possible without strain.* - Tue Nov  3 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued doing the leg stretches, recovering what little stamina he lost while he did so. He then bent his right leg and extended his left out. The taijutsu specialist began to stretch toward his right leg again, while extending his left out. His hands were pressed to his kneecap, and his torso practically leaned upon his right thigh. The male would slowly stop stretching his legs, standing up straight.* - Tue Nov  3 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) bounced up and down, alternating between each foot as he did so. He'd agilely bound off of both of his feet, performing a rapid backflip and landing in a crouched position. He needed to find something to test his -true- strength. Izutora could try it out on someone, but he didn't want to hurt anyone. The male turned to face the nearby boulder, a small, genuine smile plastering itself to his facial features. The male would thrust directly toward the boulder at full speed, pulling his right arm back as his left arm was extended outward, bended slightly with an open hand.* - Tue Nov  3 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) twisted his torso to the right to accentuate his stancing as he rushed at the boulder. He thrusted his right arm outward at full momentum with great accuracy. His hand balled into a fist only three inches from reaching the boulder. His knuckles smashed against the boulder, producing a three-inch indent where he punched. Fissures spread from where he struck, spreading across the entirety of the rock.* - Tue Nov  3 16:45:39 2015

The ground beneath the rock practically -blasted- into a crater as the shockwave bursted out. Sand bursted all around his frame, spreading outward.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) approached the training fields, moving forth with his arms alone while he was in handstand position.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) flung himself forth, removing himself from handstand position and standing up straight. He inhaled through his nose and exhaled through his mouth, bending his arms at his sides. He'd thrust his right arm forth, jabbing at the air with a right hook then bringing his arm back and punching with the other. The male continued to punch at the air in front of him, exuberance pushing him along. The well-influenced youth specialist continued these hand-to-hand combat exercises.* - Thu Nov  5 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Hey uh...youthitude over there. How about a friendly spar? - Thu Nov  5 04:08:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes. It's a defensive technique. - Thu Nov  5 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Sounds interesting. - Thu Nov  5 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: This is the technique of a friend of mine, and of my teacher. - Thu Nov  5 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) pulled his fist back, proceeding to bend his knees. He'd shoot upright, performing a rapid gyration throughout the air as he ascended higher, spinning like a top. He'd descend with one leg lifted upright, allowing it to press to the earth as he stood across from her. He'd fold his left arm behind his back, and extend his right out in front of him, slightly bent with his back palm facing hers; he stood up straight. "Come at me when you wish! Show me your youth!"* - Thu Nov  5 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) stood and awaited patiently.* - Thu Nov  5 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The key to this technique is movement. You should move as if you're like water, and react accordinly. - Thu Nov  5 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Working on it... - Thu Nov  5 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Shall we begin? - Thu Nov  5 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Indeed. Come at me when you desire! - Thu Nov  5 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) simply awaited for her as she made her approach. With a look of determination set upon his features, he took in whatever information on her fighting capabilities that were obvious to his untrained eye. He watched as she breezed toward him, proceeding to lift his onyx-gaze up at her as she went airborn, at which point he'd bend his knees.

He threw his left arm up, aiming to block the attack with the back of his wrist. In one quick motion he'd attempt to throw a right hook, directed to her abdomen. He was pulling on his punches, making sure that he didn't use too much of the physical strength that he possessed. The slickback haired individual was confident that he had the upper-hand within this fight.

His punch would at least hold enough strength to perhaps debillitate her from proceeding with any more attacks. His first goal was to distance himself to return whatever enslaught she'd prepared for him. For now, he was on a mix of the defensive and offensive.* - Thu Nov  5 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) smiled confidently. The male was very familiar with this technique, infact... he had his own version. Both of them most likely possessed the same technqiue, only with a differentiation of name. There wasn't much time for him to analyze her attacks, only to tank or manage to avoid them. Stamina was no issue for him, he was stocked up on it, even without having undergone the training that most people did to reinforce their stamina.

He expected that she was only harming herself by hitting him at full power. The slickback-haired male would simply wait for her to give him an opening before he responded to her barrage* - Thu Nov  5 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: The idiot is getting a little better. - Thu Nov  5 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) gleamed with delight. He'd nod, proceeding to bow lightly while maintaining eye contact with the female. "I do! Your daily training regime should consist of four hundred pushups, six hundred situps, one hundred and fifty mountain climbers, sixty jumping jacks, and fourty minutes of sustaining handstand position!" He'd state, throwing his right arm out and giving her a thumbs up, allowing one of his teeth to shine brightly as he cheesed at the redhead.

"You did good! Your youth is already a force to be reckoned with!"* - Thu Nov  5 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: That was how much I did when I was as experienced as her. - Thu Nov  5 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Great! I was simply advising a toned down training regime for someone of your experience! - Thu Nov  5 05:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: When you have bloomed into a foundation of youth capable of defending your comrades, that is when your youth has evolved into the epitome that one is destined for! - Thu Nov  5 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) thinks: What are they talking about now? - Thu Nov  5 05:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: It's the downfall of youth, right? - Thu Nov  5 05:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) thinks: I could dig my way into the other room but gramps will probaly be mad at me. - Fri Nov  6 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) had by now reached the room upon hearing Tetsumi's wail of pain. Izutora would thrust forth after the gravity returned to normal, removing a kunai and proceeding to whip it between Macbeth and Tetsumi, intending to make Macbeth's intention be focused on the kunai gliding by. In the meantime, Izutora would sprint in front of Tetsumi, bounding off of the earth and performing a rapid spin.

"Dainamikku, Entorii!"

He intended to flying sidekick the intruder in the jaw, aiming to increase the distance between himself, Tetsumi and the foe.* - Fri Nov  6 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) was easily knocked out of commission by the conjunction of weaponry. The male would roll across the floor, bleeding rather badly. If he didn't hurry up... he'd die at some point. Though... fortunately for him he had time. His blurry...onyx stare was set upon the male that dispatched him. There were only a few specific thoughts going through his head.

<I... am still far... from being a pillar of youth... a foundation of Sunagakure... is this the extent... to my power.. as the Green Beast..!? If it is... I'm inefficient...> His breathes were hollow and heavy, as though he was trying to deal with the pain resonating within his calf and stomach. He had to wait for the right opportunity... that right opportunity being when his opponent wasn't distracted.

<I... refuse to.. let you live a life of solitude... Zephira! Not yet..! I will grow stronger for you.. and my village... that is my pledge... as not the Green Beast... but Sabara, Izutora..> He'd state, his back pressed against the wall. His gaze cleared a little bit, as he peered at Kuro and Fujitora. He'd try to stand, but his legs were feeble... so he halted only moments after his attempt.

<I must live..>* - Fri Nov  6 04:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) started wrapping his wounds with his arm gauze.* - Fri Nov  6 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) whispers: (i was icly holding onto consciousness because i knew if i didnt patch up my wounds i'd die.) - Fri Nov  6 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) whispers: (i'd die if i fell unconsicous, basically) - Fri Nov  6 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I ah... - Fri Nov  6 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Don't know anything about treating wounds. - Fri Nov  6 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But I do know how to fight. - Fri Nov  6 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I can't do anything to help that guy- but I might be able to help if I come against that guy. - Fri Nov  6 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't know..I don't want to kill the man, and I don't want anyone to die.  - Fri Nov  6 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't believe in taking a life. I'm going to end this on my terms. - Fri Nov  6 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I just hope I make it out. - Fri Nov  6 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) breathed lightly by now. He was still bleeding, but his arm gauze had stopped him from bleeding out. He wasn't at risk of dying anymore.

"Show him the extent of your youth.. I'll be fine.. ! I can make it.."

He flashed a small smile, one of his teeth gleaming in the process. He'd give Kuro a weak thumbs up, before passing out from too much blood loss.* - Fri Nov  6 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Good Luck...Hrm? - Fri Nov  6 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah.. you're alright then, yeah sir? - Fri Nov  6 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) 

Knocking at the door.* - Fri Nov  6 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: Fuck you. - Fri Nov  6 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) peered at the pregnant woman with a look of mild surprise and discontent. He'd heard things about her.. but they contradicted her seemingly tranquil aura. He'd bow to her as best as possible, his right leg in a cast and his hands clenching at a pair of crutches tucked beneath his arm pits.

"I've heard that you are an extraordinary medic! I have come to you seeking surgery for the wound inflicted to my stomach! I may not possess the proper funds to pay back... but I shall do my best to make it up to you! I have someone important in my life that I do not wish to abandon by dying!" He'd declare, rather exuberant for the injuries he had.

There was gauze wrapped around his lower torso, but it was stained with maroon.

<What does surgery mean?> He thought to himself.* - Fri Nov  6 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) also removed the look of discontent; he felt it was rude to show the pain he was in at the moment. He was too gullible to take note of the fact that her aura of peace may've been a facade. The blood didn't hint it to him.. at all.* - Fri Nov  6 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) moved forth. There was a chill running down his spine, but he could only identify it as a symptom of his injuries, and not her sinister interior.

"I would like to have an operation on my stomach... I was stabbed in the middle of a fight." He'd state, unraveling the gauze from around his lower torso and exposing the terrible injury. It was no joke; he'd die in the next week without treatment.* - Fri Nov  6 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) 

His mouth was a flat line and his eyes were half-lidded. His face had "wtf" written all over it as he moved throughout the basement. He'd follow along, stepping into the operation room and laying down on whatever surface would allow her to do her 'magic'; only if she allowed him to, though.* - Fri Nov  6 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: A9lmost done - Fri Nov  6 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) awoke on the sofa. It appeared that the surgery was done. The pain hindering his body had minimized; now all that was left was his leg, which'd also been stabbed.. by the same person.* - Fri Nov  6 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) nodded, the exuberant individual intending to stand up.

"I have indeed! I will walk off this foot injury!" He'd exclaim, attempting to take a step forth with his right leg. His leg gave out under him, applying a -MASSIVE- amount of pain to his senses and causing him to topple forward. He instinctively threw his hands out, pressing his palms to the floorboards and lifting into a handstand. He squinted and clenched his teeth at the pain.

"I... assume I'll have to retire to this form of movement for now.. I wish not to hinder your rest, miss!"* - Fri Nov  6 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: I was stabbed by the same person who stabbed me in the stomach! - Fri Nov  6 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Would it be too much to ask for you to heal my leg as well, Miss Zenaki? - Fri Nov  6 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) remained perfectly stable, balance-wise as she healed him. The male was appauled by her magnificent healing capabilities. "I shall treat the repaired parts of my body greatly. I appreciate it, Miss Zenaki!" He'd state exuberantly, proceeding to lean his legs downward, standing upright.

"I cannot promise that my training regime won't be taxing... but I will ensure it doesn't injure me that badly!" He'd state, giving her a thumbs up and a gleamy-toothed smile.* - Fri Nov  6 23:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mmh. Just don't train to hard. In a week you should be fine. - Fri Nov  6 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: And kind of, Hanae.  - Fri Nov  6 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You know me longer then today. I'm not a healing person. But I need to do my job. - Fri Nov  6 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: I shall depart now! - Fri Nov  6 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) aimed to make his exit.

"Thank you again!"* - Fri Nov  6 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I see. - Fri Nov  6 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: So fuji isn't here is he? - Fri Nov  6 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. No problem. - Fri Nov  6 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: See ya. - Fri Nov  6 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) stood atop the roof of the weaponry shop, his arms folded and his foot pressed to a slightly ascended part of the building.

<Now I see.. father. You were right when you said what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.> He'd think to himself.* - Fri Nov  6 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Fuji. Take this guy to prison for me. - Fri Nov  6 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: My youth shall become a foundation for the one I love.. and the rest of Sunagakure.. that is my pledge as the Green Beast! - Fri Nov  6 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) hopped off of the building, proceeding to land on his left foot, then slowly lower his right. He moved forth toward the more populated part of the courtyard.* - Fri Nov  6 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) thinks: I need more power . . DO you Think Zenaki could.. Imporve me? - Fri Nov  6 23:39:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Needing and wanting power are two seperate things. - Fri Nov  6 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) exhaled. The only trace of the wounds that'd been inflicted upon him several days ago were stitches on his stomach.* - Fri Nov  6 23:45:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) had an aura of renewal about him. Though, a little bit of dread immersed him upon her news.

"I don't want to lose you.. you almost lost me. I would've died in the next week without the woman that helped me out.." He'd definitely changed from the experience of being so heavily beaten in a fight. He looked as though he was even more determined then before to become stronger. The frown of discontent and several other facial augmentations to match his mood displayed that.

For the first time, his onyx-stare shifted to the right.

"I don't advise entering.. but it's your choice, Zephira!"

His stare drifted back to her, and a half-hearted, seemingly weak grin formed.* - Sat Nov  7 04:15:34 2015

None the less he was going to pursue what his original intentions were. The male would come to a standstill a reasonable distance from her, bowing and drifting his onyx-gaze up to her.

"I apologize, I overthought things. I myself would participate if I wasn't still recovering from my leg injury! You have my aspiration, Zephira!"
