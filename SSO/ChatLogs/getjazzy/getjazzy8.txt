<br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Good work. - Thu Oct 22 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Easy catch. - Thu Oct 22 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mm.. - Thu Oct 22 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: No, i'm okay.. - Thu Oct 22 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'm sure. - Thu Oct 22 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Hassan, I have to be honest with you... - Thu Oct 22 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) rushed forward eagerly. He'd perform a rapid spin then thrust his leg into the air in front of him, receding it then spinning once more to hit the air again. Such movments would link into a low kick, a spin, then a medium-level kick, followed by yet another spin. Buoyancy's effect was applied to his body as he did this, and by the time he performed a high kick and spun once more he was already a few feet off the earth. In one rapid motion he'd axe kick the air in front of him quickly.* - Thu Oct 22 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) felt more determination and adrenaline course through every fiber in his body. Izutora would bend his knees and then leap off, performing a small leap to make it so that his body was at least a foot into the air. He'd suddenly perform a series of kicks, starting off with a low kick which lead into a quick spin. He'd perform a medium-level kick then spin once more, finally performing a high-level kick. Once again he had reinforced his position in the air with the buoyancy added from the utilization of the technique.

Taking advantage of the height into the air, the male thrusted down his right leg in a rapid axe kick.

"Leaf Great Whirlwind!"* - Thu Oct 22 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) contemplated whether or not he was improving with his usage of the Leaf Great Whirlwind technique. The "Green Beast" of Sunagakure would bend his knees and lean forth with his torso. Izutora would eagerly move forth, thrusting his leg out in a flying sidekick motion. As his buoyancy decreased with his usage of this technique, he'd perform a rapid spin.

The male would perform a low kick, performing a spin to link it into a medium kick. The green jacket wearing male would perform another spin to link the medium kick into a high kick, and he'd end the series of kicks by thrusting his leg downward while he was in midair from the extra buoyancy applied from the rapid gyration of his frame while performing the technique.* - Thu Oct 22 11:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wow he's bad at planning. Seems to run in the family. - Thu Oct 22 20:03:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Also you'll need a lot of control for that jutsu so don't go abusing it. - Thu Oct 22 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) sat outside of his house, doing general stretches.* - Thu Oct 22 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Let us proceed things that lovers do within my home, Zephira! - Thu Oct 22 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Hm? - Thu Oct 22 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: I'm fine..I'll watch Shinobi Life time.. - Thu Oct 22 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Shall we watch together? - Thu Oct 22 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) attempted to clasp her hand before unlocking the door to his house, guiding her in before closing it behind her and locking it for safety purposes. His home had very good furniture, and seemed to be taken care of.* - Thu Oct 22 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: I would suppose so...Whtat's with you? - Thu Oct 22 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Acting all....Romancy... - Thu Oct 22 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) coiled his arms around her waist, pulling her close. His fiery gaze peered down at her. "I am simply expressing to you how much I care for your presence." He'd state, his tone as genuine as ever.

<I have studied romance..! I shall treat Zephira ten times better than I treat myself as the epitome of youth, Lord Muhhammed, has instructed me to!>* - Thu Oct 22 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) settled down on the sofa, his arms wrapped around Zephira.

"I simply wish to show you what I've learned from reading about relationships!"* - Thu Oct 22 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) rested his chin on the top of her head, his arms remaining coiled around her waist. He'd slowly shift around so that himself and Zephira would be laying on the couch, he himself laying ontop of her, face-to-face with the redhead.

"Like this.." Izsutora would murmur, smiling at her passionately.* - Thu Oct 22 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Er... Zephira! - Thu Oct 22 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) looked up to her with his onyx gaze, seemingly tense. His arms were coiled around her shoulders, but his grasp tightened a little bit, but not enough to discomfort her. "I... am tempted to... elope with you right now.. ! However.. ! I refuse to because you stated it's too early. So.. I promise not to do anything that will discomfort you!" He'd pledge with an exuberance-consumed tone.* - Thu Oct 22 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) night moths the shit out of Tetsumi.* - Thu Oct 22 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) embraced her comfortaly, pressing his frame closer to hers. His gaze would attempt to catch hers, as he noticed that she was staring at the fire. "Are you sure..?" He'd question, his teeth sinking into his bottom lip. He was tensed; he was obviously suffering from sexual tension.* - Fri Oct 23 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) shook his head suddenly. He'd lean forward, locking lips with her shortly then parting. "Are you tired?" Izutora would ask, able to perceive her fatigue on her features. The male would snuggle close to her regardless of her answer, intending to bring warmth to her body.* - Fri Oct 23 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) would respond. "I am not tired, but your feelings and health are more important priorities than my own, Zephira!" He'd pledge, continuing to provide her with the warmth emanating from his form.* - Fri Oct 23 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) scooched a little closer to her face, pressing his lips to hers before continuing to embrace her closely. His cheeks were consumed by heat. Izutora was such a freshie at romantic relationships.* - Fri Oct 23 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) repositioned himself so Zephira was laying on top of him. His hands would stroke at her sides, massaging them. His passionate, onyx-gaze would peer up at the redhead laying atop of him.

"I love you, Zephira!" He'd state with his always-genuine, energetic tone.* - Fri Oct 23 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: I am confident that people in a relationship tell one another that they love eachother, according to what I've read.. ! - Fri Oct 23 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) bit his lower lip, tempted by her moans. Yet, he'd still continue to massage her, his hands running up her smooth sides and pressing into her curves. He wasn't really sure what he was doing, and if it was correct or invalid. His legs were parted sightly, allowing hers to be tucked between his own.

His arms secured their position around her mid-back as he halted the massage.

"Er.. did you want me to keep doing that?" He'd ask, beguiled.* - Fri Oct 23 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: N-no it's fine... - Fri Oct 23 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: I'll just lay here.. - Fri Oct 23 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) started massaging her again, but this time slowly and carefully. He was following by something he read in a relationship guide book.* - Fri Oct 23 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) tried to recall what the book said. 'Keep going even if your partner says stop, especially if it looks like they're into it.' Izutora would remember that exact sentence from one of the books. He'd continue to massage her body and run his hands across her sides, leaning forth to press his forehead against hers. The male bit his lip a little harder, drawing blood by doing so. He himself was getting pretty hot from this activity, especially when he recognized the heat emanating from her inner thighs.

"Z-Zephira.." He'd murmur with a strain of tension to his voice. A bulge would press against Zephira's form.* - Fri Oct 23 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) clenched his teeth, groaning abit, his arms securely coiled around her. His tongue would press it's way into Zephira's mouth when she initiated the kiss, with his own tongue attending to brush against hers. He squinted in sexual frustration as his erection consistently pressed against the entrance to her private area.

"G-Gah.."

The physical interaction was debillitating.* - Fri Oct 23 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) clenched his teeth harder, his eyes slamming shut. The male would fold his arms around her shoulders, holding her close. "Nnnnnnnghh...! Z-Zephira..!" He'd say in a strained tone. An odd sensation coursed through his erection as he could feel her wetness. His body was practically locked from movement, not allowing him to tuck his butt and distance his pelvis from hers like he intended.* - Fri Oct 23 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) picked her up bridal style, making sure he wasn't disturbing her rest too much. The male would rest her within his bed, proceeding to slide into the bed with her and drape the blanket over Zephira and his own frame.* - Fri Oct 23 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) cuddled her from behind as he too fell asleep.

"Good night... Zephira.." He'd murmur sleepily.* - Fri Oct 23 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Would have slapped it against Bryson's chest beforehand*> - Fri Oct 23 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'm okay. - Fri Oct 23 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: ---Oh yeah! The kick. - Fri Oct 23 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) exited the scene performing a walking handstand.* - Fri Oct 23 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Whistles to Hideo*> Alrigh. Let's rock. - Fri Oct 23 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued to patter along across the sand on his palms, not really acknowledging any of his surroundings, save for any obstacles that would come in his course back to his home. As the hard-working individual he was, Izutora was taking the long way back to his home. He'd show ease and finesse with the action of exercise, indicating that either he'd grown accustomed to it or was proficient with his upper-body strength in general.

The taijutsu specialist showed little to no signs of physical strain being applied to his body. Not a single bead of sweat drained from his frame. His exposed, well-toned frame would probably explain the reason why. "If I am unable to walk in a handstand once I shall do it five more times!" He'd pledge with his energetic tone, moving along slightly quicker. Izutora still maintained the same level of stamina consumption, though.* - Fri Oct 23 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: I hope Mirai is ok - Fri Oct 23 03:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah, when I clock out and go home. - Fri Oct 23 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If you're looking for something to do, you could practice what I taught you. - Fri Oct 23 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Oh, okay... - Fri Oct 23 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: I'll get to it! - Fri Oct 23 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued to take steps equivalent to his normal walking speed within the handstand. Izutora would continued motioning forward, still physically stable. Only a few beads of sweat dripped from him, but otherwise he kept on going. He'd pivot with his palms, shifting his position so that he was facing Makoto, in addition to Bryson.

The male would thrust his legs downward, standing upright and performing leg stretches. His energetic gaze would confront Bryson, but only after he took note of Makoto. The taijutsu specialist would crouch down, depending on if Makoto was still within handstand position, taking note of her fatigue. He was clueless that she was initially following him.

"Readjust the manner that you're positioning yourself in, you're exhausting yourself quicker that way..." Izutora would state with his zesty voice, a genuine smile forming on his facial features. A single tooth of his shined brightly. He'd extend his right arm out, halting the movement if she showed signs of decline to his actions.

If not, he'd start safely repositioning Makoto's arms in a manner that would be less-taxing to her upper body strength. His actions lacked hostility, and only diligent intentions of improving the efficiency of his comrade's training regimes. All the while as he was adjusting her arms, he'd give her tips on how to conserve her stamina.

Of course, he wasn't aware that she may or may not have understood what he was saying.* - Fri Oct 23 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Well I tried - Fri Oct 23 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Katsune are you busy? - Fri Oct 23 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) realized that it wasn't the posture she had, considering that handstand posture was -always- the same, regardless of the person that performed it. It was rather, her lack of stamina. With that being said, Izutora would settle down, seating himself on his butt, folding one leg while stretching the other out to the side. He performed a vague hand motion which indicated for Makoto to get out of handstand position.

He could tell that something was up about her. It still hadn't clicked to him that she wasn't very fluent in the language he was speaking. He was ignorant of what she was speaking, particularly because he never heard her speak. "Rest for now if you feel up to it! The next time you shall perform the exercise you'll be five times more efficient; your youth is astounding!" He'd hollar, performing the traditional 'nice guy' pose. He'd give her a thumbs up and show off his glistening, passionate grin.* - Fri Oct 23 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. - Fri Oct 23 03:59:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) couldn't tell if she understood him or not. He'd fish throughout his backpouch which seemed to have endless storage, proceeding to remove a folded up, tight-fitting green jumpsuit. He'd grin passionately then proceed to speak with his dynamic, rather exuberant tone! "I will take you under my tutelage, and ensure you bloom into a foundation of youth!" He'd state, folding both of his legs then proceeding to bow toward her with his onyx-gaze still set upon the female.

He'd stand, getting into handstand position. He'd lift his hand briefly, waving goodbye toward Makoto before pressing his palm to the earth once more. "I shall depart now!" Izutora would state, proceeding to walk on his hands off into the distance, intending to return home.* - Fri Oct 23 04:11:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) pulled out the key to his home, unaware of Zephira's presence. He'd shove it into the door, pushing it open.

"Now... what type of training should I do after I eat dinner!? Cardiovascular Endurance.. muscular endurance!?" He'd mumble to himself.* - Tue Oct 27 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) turned toward Zephira as he opened the door, lifting a brow. "I didn't know you'd arrived." Izutora stated with his exuberant, gleaming grin. The male would approach her, swooping her up in his arms and carrying her into his home. He'd settle her down on the sofa, closing the front door and locking it, at which point he'd respond to her statement.

"Heart endurance..? So my stamina!?" He'd state. That sounded interesting -and- easy. The male took notice of how focused and tensed she was, but he didn't say anything yet. "They were wonderful! They've made it much easier to train!" He'd reveal. The male began to jog while remaining in place.* - Tue Oct 27 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: Cardiovascular endurance it is! - Tue Oct 27 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) accepted the batch. He'd move forth, his arms wrapping around her and pulling her close to him. He'd gaze down at her with his fierce, enthusiastic, onyx-gaze.

"You are obviously straining your mind with the effort you've been putting in, relax, please, Zephira!" He'd state.* - Tue Oct 27 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Hehe, yea...I guess you can say that. - Tue Oct 27 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Then what do you wish to do for now? - Tue Oct 27 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Well..Massage me.. - Tue Oct 27 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) removed the gauze from around his hands and forearms. He'd proceed to place his hands on her shoulders, pressing his fingertips firmly to the tensed vicinity of her shoulders. He'd proceed to apply pressure that was only -slightly- painful but also relieving; he began relieving the stiffness of her muscles within the area. His knees were pressed into the sofa as he hovered over her while she lay on her back across the furnishing.

"How does that feel.. Zephira?" He'd question, slightly nervous.* - Wed Oct 28 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) squeezed a little harder, pressing into the muscle tissue. It appeared that this was no difficulty for him.

"Now..?" He'd question.* - Wed Oct 28 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Mmm...Now this I like.. - Wed Oct 28 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) lowered his hands slightly, applying pressure to any seemingly tensed areas of her body.* - Wed Oct 28 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) subconsciously drifted his gaze downward, catching sight of her butt. He'd gulp, the pressure applied to her muscle tissue increasing, before he started using the stabilized level of strength he was applying before. The male couldn't help but grow even more nervous, gazing down at her frame. He continued massaging her, though he'd grow nervous and uncomfortable any time she'd writh in pleasure from the massage.* - Wed Oct 28 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) slammed his eyes shut and clenched his teeth, the taijutsu specialist flushing red when he noticed her legs spread and expose her groin. It never came to mind that she may've been teasing his temptations, but none the less he resisted them. He would lower his hands abit after feeling the tension go away, massaging her mid-sides. He was close to her at this point, with his hands stroking at the sides of her torso to remove tension. Or.. that's what his conscious intentions were. He was passively attempting to pleasure her.* - Wed Oct 28 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) coiled his arms around her, proceeding to pull her into his grasp. He'd allow her to rest within his lap, while leaning against the arm of the sofa, leaning back against it. He'd run his hands down her sides, to her thighs, stroking them. His chin would rest on her right shoulder, heat emanating from him. His face was flushed out of nervousness and increased libido. "T..  this.. is not cardiovascular endurance training.. " He'd murmur. He was simply going on a whim with his actions.

<I guess I should call this libido endurance training..> He'd think.* - Wed Oct 28 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) widened his eyes. He'd gulp, nodding lightly. "I... alright..!" He'd state, proceeding to press his warm hands to her inner thighs. The male would begin to massage her inner thighs, slowly managing to reach his way around the entirety of her thighs, and to her knees. He'd continue to massage, intending to remove the effects of stress on her body to the greatest extent.* - Wed Oct 28 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) whispers: ya. - Wed Oct 28 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: -omit- - Wed Oct 28 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: I'll get the rest of the tension in your inner thighs after I finish the rest of your legs.. okay? - Wed Oct 28 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) stopped massaging her lower legs. He'd drift his hands to her inner thighs, beginning to massage them again. He intensely gazed at her, as though captivated by the beauty in her that he never noticed. His onyx-gaze ran along the length of her flowing red hair. The male wrapped his arms around her thighs, stroking her inner thighs as he moved forth so that her back would be pressed to the sofa cushion.

Izutora would crane his neck forth. "I... love you.." He'd murmur, before attempting to lock lips with her. All the while, he continued stroking at her thighs.* - Wed Oct 28 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) gulped, his face flushing even more. His eyes locked onto hers, as he guided his arms around her, pulling her closer. He'd embrace her, his legs between hers. "It has little to do with your appearance! I love you for your personality.. your appearance only amplifies the amount of appeal that you already had from your personality alone!" He'd state honestly. At this point he was rock hard.* - Wed Oct 28 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) looked down at her with his widened gaze. He'd nod, suddenly becoming more confident in the situation at hand. With a nod and a shiny-toothed, genuine smile the male would guide his face toward her untouched "jewel" of a part of her body. Izutora would glide his tongue along the outer, pink lips of Zephira's vagina. The tip of his tongue often prodded along the crevice concealing her hymen and the inner part of her vagina.

He'd guide his tongue to the small bundle of skin and nerves above her lips, her clitoris. The male would drift his gaze to her, his face red with nervousness. Though, he cautiously took the initiative, most likely sending a wave of pleasure throughout her as he stroked the centre of nerves with his tongue. He was new to this experience, but so was she, which made him a little more comfortable. He hoped that he was doing things properly.* - Wed Oct 28 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued gliding his tongue along her clitoris. He felt as though he was doing a good job just winging it. He'd hands were clasped around her thighs at this point, but he'd run his hands along her thighs, his hands clutching at her buttocks. His tongue would continue to prod and lick at her crotch. He definitely didn't know what a vagina tasted like, much less that it was fruity.* - Wed Oct 28 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) gasped in surprise when she pulled him closer. The male would slowly regain his bearins from the sudden gesture, being able to tell that he was -really- pleasuring her from this. The taijutsu specialist would slowly stick his tongue out, at this point immersing his tongue in the warmth of the inner walls of her vagina, running it's length along her flesh. "Z..Zephira.." He'd say in a muffled tone, continuing to commit cunnilingus on his delightful woman.* - Wed Oct 28 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) widened his eyes. "O-Okay.." He'd slowly pull back, pulling the waistline to his pair of green pants down to his knees, pressing his back to the arm of the sofa. His shaft stood tall, bulging and rock-hard.* - Wed Oct 28 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) extended his arms out slightly, wrapping them around her. "A.. Alright... Z.. Zephira.." He'd murmur, his gaze locked with hers. He'd slide his hands down upon the top of her thighs. "I.. love you too... Zephira." He'd state, leaning forth. He'd pull her down, hugging her to his chest. "I'm.. ready when you are... I'll pump you... full of my youth!" He'd state with exuberance in his nervous tone.* - Wed Oct 28 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) cradled her small body within his grasp, pressing his lips to hers to cushion the pain she was experiencing. He'd slowly slide in and out, otherwise prodding if it was too painful. He knew that he wasn't eager to harm her in the middle of an activity meant for pleasure. The feeling he was getting.. was like having a blanket coiled around his groin while he's masturbating, but ten times better. It was invigorating to his libido.

"Ze... Zephiraaaa..." He murmured.* - Wed Oct 28 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) nestled his head into her shoulder, holding her tightly as he continued to poke in and out slowly. He'd increase his tempo slightly, starting to thrust in and out at a decent-pace that wouldn't harm her. It seemed that she was as fragile as she came off to be.* - Wed Oct 28 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued to kiss her intimately, his tongue thrusting it's way into her mouth as it seeked her tongue. Izutora would go a little quicker, beginnning to shove in and retract his penis from within her soaking, pink walls. He'd eventually come to a point that he was annihilating her vaginally. The lubrication provided by her inners only made it easier.

(was busy on alternate character)* - Wed Oct 28 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) coiled his arms around her torso, proceeding to lean forth and drive his thick erection into her. He pulled her as close as possible, at this point pressing her back to his chest. He continued thrusting in and out at full momentum, his lips pecking at her neck. All the while, groans resonated from him, as he was progressively getting closer to his ejaculation.* - Wed Oct 28 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued shoving his member into her, the warmth and lubrication of his vagina making it even easier to thrust into her. The male had literally come to the ends of his sexual tolerance, ejaculating and allowing a great portion of his white fluids to consume her pink walls.

"A-Ah.."* - Wed Oct 28 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) guided his lips to her cheek, kissing her. He'd embrace her from behind, seating himself on the area of the sofa that wasn't drenched. "Such... a youthful... training activity.." He'd state, cradling her to him as close as possible. Of all the things he'd performed, that was the -first- by far that had tired him out. His arms were securely coiled around her waist, his fiery gaze set on her.

"How.. was that..?" He'd murmur, most likely falling asleep.* - Wed Oct 28 04:37:45 2015
