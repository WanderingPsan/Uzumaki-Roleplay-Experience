She'd take the snake summoning scroll on her belongings, if she even had it. Mikasa would abandon the body after taking whatever she deemed useful.* - Sat Oct  3 01:21:04 2015

He'd kick at a low angle, then perform a rapid spin by pivoting on his foot, while kicking higher with the other. The male would crouch down after the spin, sweeping the ground then performing yet another rotation, kicking the air at a high angle a total of three times.

He'd stop kicking at the air, proceeding to press his hands to the ground and start walking on them with finesse. He was new to this type of training, which was an indication to his inability to do it without getting tired out rather quickly.

"One lap.. around the village...hng.." He'd murmur.* - Sun Oct  4 17:29:10 2015

It was hard to look at the calamity that had overtook the village. Izutora hopped off his walking handstand, approaching the bodies. He stroked at his sore forearms, before heading off and returning with two graves. The male would proceed to dig two holes, placing the corpses within them. He'd enclose the soil with minor effort, placing the graves atop them.

"Rest in peace, for your acts of bravery haven't gone unheard!  Your deaths in the name of that sand beast will not be in vain!" He'd threw his right arm up above his head,

"In the name of youth! You will be avenged!"* - Sun Oct  4 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) peered within the village, looking for any signs of rebuilding. The taijutsu specialist would bend his knees, leaning forth slightly. He'd eagerly take a great leap forward, performing a trio of somersaults in the middle of the air, then landing on the ground. He'd slide his left foot behind his right, then shoot forth, his arms thrown out behind him.* - Sun Oct  4 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) extended his right arm out forth, showing off his Konohagakure headband. He pocketed his headband, performing the Nice Guy pose, giving the guards a thumbs up and giving a toothy, shimmering smile.

The bowlcut-rocking individual would fold his left arm behind his back, pressing his right palm to the ground and beginning to do pushups. His body was well-toned, but he was lacking in physical strength. He didn't acknowledge Yan's question, but he certainly answered it without hearing it.

"In the name of youth, Izutora of the Sabara family will grow! I will bloom like a leaf in the spring! And when my time comes to die those whom I've graced with the privilege of inheriting my youth will bloom in the spring as did I! I will fall as a crimson leaf in autumn shall!"

"For this is my pledge as a shinobi! My pledge as one immersed in their youth!" He shouted. The male looked at the blonde, lifting one two-inch thick brow of his.

"As you wish, kind sir!"

He'd fling his legs into the air, pressing his hands to the ground and proceeding to walk while in a handstand. Despite his struggles with doing such, he would continue until his bones felt like they'd become malleable enough to ooze from the pores of his toned arms.* - Sun Oct  4 18:23:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) rolled several times, hopping to his feet. He was breathing mildly, seeming fatigue'd. Regardless he'd follow, his beaty gaze drifting over toward Mirai briefly. He'd smile passionately, one of his teeth gleaming as he did such. "Immerse yourself in youth, miss." The bowlcut adorning male would state, following behind his squad in a jog.* - Sun Oct  4 19:23:31 2015

He'd press his hand the tip of his foot, proceeding to take his flexibility to the absolute limit. Izutora would fold his right leg up, extending his left leg out in front of him. He'd stretch this leg once more, pressing his hand to the tip of his left foot. The jumpsuit wearing, youthful individual would leap up out of performing stretches.* - Sun Oct  4 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) folded his left arm behind his back while standing straight as ever. He'd arch his right arm slightly out beside him, his head shifted toward them while the rest of his body faced his left. His fingers were pressed together, but his hand was otherwise open. A confident smile graced the bushy browed taijutsu specialist's facial features.

"I am Sabara, Izutora! I wish for my youth to bloom like a leaf in the spring, to become a foundation of strength for this village! I will be the tree that carries the weight of all spring leaves, every last youngling! I'll be the hand that carries the boulder! And when my time comes I will crumble and be submerged by the snows of eternal winter before I fail to show those that threaten my comrades the power of my youth!"* - Sun Oct  4 19:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) extended his legs out beneath him, his right arm suspending the entirety of his figure upright while extended outward. His left arm was folded behind his back. The male began to arch his arm to the point that his frame wasn't even an inch from touching the ground. The male would pump his right arm outward once more, continuing to perform pushups at a quick rate of momentum.

"One pushup in half a second! That is my goal! If I can't do one hundred and twenty in a minute I will do two hundred and fourty!" The bushy browed taijutsu specialist exclaimed.* - Sun Oct  4 20:29:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) threw punches at the air in front of him rapidly. He'd pull his fists back, suddenly initiating a rush of furious, well-experienced kicks. The male would pivot on his left heel, kicking straightforward with his right then descend the sole of his foot toward the ground as he lifted his left leg, kicking directly at the air in front of him. The rapid movements would grant him the buoyancy he needed, as he performed another rotation.

The bowlcut-rocking individual would suddenly jet his right leg forth, arching his left as he flying sidekicked the air, thrusting upward diagonally.

The male would extend his right arm out, his knuckles speeding throughout the air rapidly. He'd follow up with two more jabs with the same fist, arching his left arm. He'd suddenly shoot his left outward, pulling his right back just a little bit. He'd jab the air with his left, suddenly beginning to throw a series of punches in front of him, alternating with each fist.* - Sun Oct  4 22:35:31 2015
