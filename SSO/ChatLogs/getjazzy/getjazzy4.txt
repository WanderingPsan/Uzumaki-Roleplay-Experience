<br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) eagerly regained his footing after performing the twin kicks. He'd take one cartwheel, well aware of his surroundings while doing such. The male would fish throughout his backpouch, demoralized when he found that he couldn't find a kunai knife. He clutched onto something that seemed to be much more useful for his tactics.

Suddenly, his hand would emerge from his backpouch...holding.... a fish. He'd whip the fish directly at Amon, and without a second thought he'd bound off of his feet, performing a quick spin backward throughout the air, before shooting toward Amon, his left leg tucked in and his right leg extended out. He aimed to smack his sole into Amon's jaw.

"Kind sir, are you okay!?" He'd hollar, shaking the male. He'd take a gaze toward Kida, shaking his head.

"I'm sorry but I must decline! I must report to your village leader, correct!? But what about this man's health!? He might've been allergic to fish without me knowing! Killing someone with someone so measly as their allergies is not youthful!" He'd shout, glistening, manly tears forming at the corner of his beaty orbs.* - Tue Oct  6 02:23:47 2015

One of his beaty orbs glistened as he approached the mountain, cracking his knuckles then bending his knees. He'd launch himself into the air, soaring a decent distance high before unraveling the gauze around his hands, clasping to any rock that he could get a good grip on. Izutora would hang from a low distance on the mountain, at least fourteen feet up.

To give himself more of a challenge the bowl-cut loving teen would fold his right arm behind his back, suspending himself high up with his left hand. Izutora would bend and extend his left arm, though he couldn't sustain this for long, and thus his right arm unfolded from behind his back. He'd start extending and arching his arms, before letting go and descending to the ground in several spins throughout the air.* - Tue Oct  6 04:07:53 2015

He suspended the entirety of his body weight down upon his right palm, proceeding to arch his arm and then extend it outward. He'd perform pushups quickly, the prodigious taijutsu specialist recognizing the fault in his training regime.

<While I increased my speed, I've yet to increase my muscle!> He'd think as he shoved downward, sustaining his body weight upon his right arm. He'd shove back up after one point five seconds of holding the descension. The bushy browed male would shoot up once more, placing a half second gap between his next descension.

"One hundred pushups, followed by ninety six seconds of sustained ascension upon the mountain! It shall be two hundred pushups, and one hundred and ninety two seconds if I cannot accomplish either!" The jumpsuit wearing male hollared.

For someone of his training in Taijutsu, he was barely sweating from this activity. The jumpsuit wearing male continued to pump downward, stating the number he was on for pushups. Upon reaching the hundredth pushup he'd bounce off the earth by applying a firm rush of strength to his palms, backflipping over Genesis' frame the very moment his frame was positioned upright.

He'd pivot on his left heel, leaning forth and throwing his arms out behind him, rushing away from the vicinity eagerly.* - Wed Oct  7 20:27:56 2015

The uchiha struggled as much as she could, but it was futile..Rymei would also notice a carved in tatoo right above the female's ass...Kohaku would've heard the word punishment as she'd have flashbacks from kirie..and then to edge..Why..did people always have to do this..?

She'd bite onto her tonuge tightly, causing a bit of blood to come out of it as rymei forcefully inserted the piece of wood inside of kohaku, she wasn't an ass-virgin, but she was still pretty tight..So it would hurt like all hell. Kohaku's bum suddenly began to swirl with pain as it got warm and painful. The girl let out a scream, but kept her tongue bitten down as it was more of an inside scream..Her finger continued to bleed out, her body shaking profusely..She didn't like this one bit..

The girl's breathing increased as her heart rate went up, she was going through a panic attack as memories flooded into her mind from the hours of torture done to her ass..Painful memories scarring her brain as the girl was shaking even more then before, going through a large panic attack.*)* - Thu Oct  8 00:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) bent his knees, looking onward in front of him. He'd run forward as fast as possible, then proceed to take a leap at the very last second when he was only inches from faceplanting against the wall. He'd proceed to somersault through the air, then slam his feet against the tall structure. He'd extend his arms out, performing a flexibility stretch while clasping onto the rocks at the same time, securing his position nineteen feet high on the mountain that Kumogakure's mansion stood atop.* - Thu Oct  8 11:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) attempted to lift his right leg above his left and above the position where his hands were. He'd guide his right hand a little above his right leg, then proceed to lift his left some, followed by his left leg. He was straining his body considerably by trying to stretch in such a hardcore manner. None the less, his goal was to scale the mansion of Kumogakure, without the aid of chakra, even though he could fully use his own. The bowlcut haired individual kicked off of the mountain, performing a backward flip then landing in a crouched position.* - Thu Oct  8 11:48:41 2015

He'd press his right palm firmly against the ground below him, beginning to arch and re-extend his right arm. Izutora's primary focus was his upper body strength training. His surroundings were seemingly no regard to him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) slowly stood up from doing his leg stretches, a stern, beaty gaze shifting itself toward Ambrocio. He'd remove a kunai and an explosive tag from his pocket, proceeding to whip it toward the male, aiming to at least slash his face as it glided by him when thrown. The explosive tag would detonate shortly after coming in close contact with the male. From the smoke that perhaps shrouded Ambrocio would emerge the bushy browed, bowlcut adorning individual.

His right leg shot out, and he aimed to smash his foot against the male's jaw.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) had lowered his leg in midair though, so the flying sidekick wouldn't even have hit her, if she did stay there. He'd look around, raising one of his bushy eyebrows. The male would hop onto his hands, performing a handstand and trotting across the ground on his palms. His legs hung in the air.* - Thu Oct  8 21:42:36 2015
