<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) crouched down, proceeding to extend one leg out to the side and lean toward the direction he extended it out to. He'd proceed to bend said leg and begin to lean toward the opposite leg, and stretch it. Izutora shifted right and left while performing the leg stretches, before standing up almost straight, a small bend to his knees. He'd suddenly run off in a jog.* - Fri Oct  9 00:06:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: -omit- - Fri Oct  9 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) took a brief leap backward. He'd spectate the situation, making it clear he had no intentions of getting involved. Moments later he'd lose interest in the situation, proceeding to bend his knees at fifteen degrees and race off in a jog, inhaling through his nose and exhaling through his mouth. He'd regulate his breathing, in addition to his stamina to further his training. The bowlcut adorned individual would progressively incline the rate of momentum that he applied, eventually reaching full sprint as he ran around the village with no regard for situations that he passed by on.* - Fri Oct  9 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued running forward. He'd incline his speed to full sprint, breezing along the outside of the residences to Kumogakure no Sato. "I must complete this training if I wish to improve my speed!" He'd shout, proceeding to accelerate if he could anymore. The green, jumpsuit-wearing, taijutsu specialist continued to move forward. He'd sprint along any specifically busy streets of Kumogakure no Sato, solely for avoiding any last-minute obstacles in his sprint throughout the village, which wasn't predetermined. He'd seek out the training fields.* - Fri Oct  9 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) rushed into the training grounds. The bowl-cut wearing individual would continue to move his legs in place. He'd duck down, extending his legs out and pressing his right arm out beneath him, suspending the entirety of his body weight upon his right arm. He'd fold his left arm behind his back. Izutora would breath lightly, slightly puckered out from sprinting/running/jogging around the village.

"One...two..three...four... five.....six.. " He'd continue counting until he reached a total of one hundred and fifty pushups, all of which he'd be capable of completing in nearly three minutes at the pace he was performing said pushups. Izutora would press his left hand against the plated training field, his other hand pressing firmly against it as well. The taijutsu specialist would proceed to bounce into standing position, pivoting on his feet as he continued to 'run in place'.

"Here goes!"

He'd exclaim, proceeding to run off at a pace a little impressive compared to his previous. He was improving quickly.* - Fri Oct  9 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued moving at a decent rate of momentum. The jumpsuit wearing bowlcut boy would race acorss the tiles. He'd pump his arms at his sides, with them completely bent at an acute angle. His fingers were pressed together. He breathed in through his nose and out through his mouth, keeping a decent speed. He flared his nostrils, seeming rather pumped about this training activity. Running was the easiest thing he could do, especially with his stamina reserves.* - Fri Oct  9 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) felt his beaty gaze burn with passion as he looked on ahead at the area in front of him. His two-inch thick brows descended. The Sabara family member kept on running forward, having nearly met the ending of the tiles in a few seconds. He'd pay no mind to his surroundings, but rather the path in front of him. His barely sweating body, and his still even breathes, only made it easier to do such a thing.* - Fri Oct  9 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) was very close to reaching the outside of the training field. He'd bend his knees some then take a leap. He'd land upon the top of the fluorescent green gate. He'd take a prepared leap from the fence, somersaulting forward then landing on the pathway. Izutora continued moving forward, his arms thrown out behind him. He still wasn't exhausted.* - Fri Oct  9 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued sprinting forward at a relatively quick place. He'd inhale thorugh his nose and exhale through his mouth. The bushy browed, bowlcut-wearing individual would continue to move forward. As usual he disregarded his surroundings. He'd sacrifice just some time, his beaty eye'd stare drifting to the vicinity around him. He'd continue moving rapidly, intending to make sure that he could completely gauge his stamina.* - Fri Oct  9 00:31:34 2015

"Rest in peace, kind sir."

He'd stand up, giving a beaty glance to the individuals nearby before trying to make his departure from the vicinity. He had more training to do. Somewhere in his heart he felt the necessity to train even harder for the sake of their deaths.* - Fri Oct  9 02:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) rolled his forearms up in gauze, along with the entirety of his hands. He'd proceed to pull his right arm backward, He'd bend his knees and lower his bushy brows, then proceed to throw a rapid right hook toward the rock in front of him. His knuckles smacked against the rough sruface, some pain being inflicted on his knuckles. None the less he'd pull his right fist back and punch with his left rapidly.* - Fri Oct  9 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) swiftly alternated between his right and left fist. He'd continue punching at the large rock form in front of him, lacking the desire to punch -too- hard, since that would harm his fist. The male was pretty swift when it came to his movement, and he only grew quicker as his training progressed. The bowlcut-adorning taijutsu specialist continued to punch at the immense rock in front of him, not really tiring himself out.* - Fri Oct  9 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) backflipped. He'd slowly bend his knees, narrowing his pair of beaty eyes. He'd accelerate forward at a brisk rate of speed, the soles of his feet thrashing against the earth as he lunged his torso forward. He'd throw his right arm out, keeping his left at his side as he buckled his right hand into a tight fist, thrashing his knuckles firmly against the surface of the rock in front of him, sending a small reveberation across it's form. None the less, his strength wasn't sufficient enough to even crack it.* - Fri Oct  9 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) pulled his right arm back, clenching his teeth. He'd fling his left arm forth, directing his fist to the shape of the rock. "Full power!" The bushy browed, green-jumpsuit wearing, ambitious boy attempted to thrust his knuckles against the surface of the rock. He'd noticeably clench his teeth in a small bit of pain as he struck the rock. Such pain didn't stop him from pulling his left hand back once more. He jumped back some.* - Fri Oct  9 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) jumped back, leaning forward. The bowlcut boy ran forward again and threw his right arm out, directing it to the focal point of his interest. The focal point in specific was the area of the rock that he'd been striking before. He'd press his fingers against the center of his palm, balling his open hand into a fist before it into the surface of the rock. "Hyah!" He'd exclaim, some of the rock chipping away and cracking beneath his knuckles.* - Fri Oct  9 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) performed a total of three backflips. He'd zip forward, suddenly launching his right arm toward the rock, balling up both of his fists. He'd thrash his knuckles firmly against the surface of the rock, then proceed to shoot his other fist forward and smash it against the rock as well. Both punches were directed to the cracked area of the rock's surface. He'd suddenly start firing a series of punches at the rock's surface, shutting one eye at the pain resonating through his fists.* - Fri Oct  9 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) clenched his teeth, looking at his knuckles. He'd remove the gauze coiled around his forearm, tensing up when he couldn't help but wince at the pain of tapping his fingertip against one of the many bruises on his knuckles. The male would set his fists to his sides, jumping back. He'd inhale through his nose, closing his eyes, then exhaling through his mouth. He'd suddenly start whipping his fists at the air in front of him, making "Ff" sounds that were typically done by boxers.* - Fri Oct  9 23:39:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) slowly leaned down and balled his hands into knuckle-whitening fists. "Alright... I shall break five rocks if I cannot break this one!" He'd state. The jumpsuit-wearing taijutsu specialist sprinted forward, his left arm at his side while he shot his right arm outward. He smashed his fist directly against the surface of the rock; he struck at the area that he had originally cracked. Izutora would hopefully shatter the rock with the added up damage.

He set his beaty gaze on Ai, racing one of his two-inch thick brows.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) approached the small training field with the scent of desert immersing his nostrils. The considerably brighter gathering of sand appauled him some. The well-toned, green-jumpsuit wearing taijutsu specialist approached, motioning forward on the palms of his bare hands. Izutora's feet hung high in the air while he moved around in a handstand, with intentions of increasing his physical strength. The bowl-cut wearing taijutsu specialist would apply pressure to his palm-contact with the earth, pushing off the ground from handstand position and motioning back to stand on the soles of his feet.

He peered at the eight foot tall, rock-composed walls surrounding the training field, peering at the overall size of the area. It didn't seem that he was too pleased with it's lack of sufficient size. None the less, his bushy brows came to a descension as his beaty brows looked forward and he sprinted along the outer vicinity of the training field, using his momentum as throttle when he took a great leap and spun, kicking at a low standpoint at the wall.

"Leaf Great Whirlwind!"

Right after said low kick, a medium-height kick was linked, alining itself for the high kick that followed. He spun one last time for a total of four times, running his heel down the wall and leaving an indent in it's form from his heel drop. After he ran his heel down the applicable location on the wall he'd press the sole of his foot firmly to the surface of the rocky wall, pushing off and performing a rapid backflip, distancing himself.

He'd slowly run the soles of his feet across the earth, positioning himself so he was standing straight up. He'd fold his left arm behind his back and extend his right arm out slightly, bending it completely with the fingers to the corresponding hand cuffed together, his hand otherwise remaining open. He'd shoot forward, throwing his arms behind his back as he threw a flurry of punches at the wall in front of him.

He'd barrage the wall with right hooks and left hooks, perfectly attuned to fit his combat format as he managed to apply his momentum to his strength, and the full capacity of his strength to damaging the wall without majorly touching it. In a sense, his knuckles would be 'tapping' the wall, but deal full damage without him completely pressing his fist to it's form. He ended the flurry with one full power left handed-punch, which involved his fist hitting the wall completely.

The bowlcut haired male would jump back, then proceed to form a trio of backflips in total. He'd bend his knees below him, his hands balled into tight fists and slightly lifted away from his sides. His beaty pair of eyes flickered over to the violet-haired girl and the black-haired male, making sure he was well aware of their presences. He had intentions of making sure he didn't intervene with their spar, or they didn't intervene with his training.

He'd race forward, removing a kunai from his backpouich and brandishing it rapidly, slashing in a downward arc and leaving a mildly deep cut. Izutora would slash horizontally to the left, rapidly shifting the aim of his arms to his focal point in front of him, thrusting the kunai into the rocky wall then tearing it free, bounding off of the earth skillfully. He'd somersault backwards high in the air, suddenly coming to a stop while still in midair.

He'd remove two more kunai knives, both of which were equipped with exploding tags attached to the end of the two ninja tools. He'd whip the two kunai down accurately, allowing them to puncture the surface of the rocky wall far below him. He'd whip the last kunai, allowing it to dive into the earth between the two kunai knives. At that moment he formed the necessary handsign, immersing a small area of the training field in smoke and debris. He'd somersault throughout the air as he made his descension, landing within his normal taijutsu stance. Izutora would crouch downward, then leap back, gaining the necessary air to leap over the wall.

He'd proceed to dash off.* - Sat Oct 10 18:31:28 2015
