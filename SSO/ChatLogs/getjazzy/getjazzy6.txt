<br><br><font color=teal>*Ko-Ko(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: My parents told me to stop when I stabbed them. - Sun Oct 11 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) clasped her left hand, snagging her close and regrasping her hand with his right. His left hand would position itself on the mid-point of her back, his right sweeping beneath her kneecaps as he picked her up bridal style. The taijutsu specialist would dash away in an instant.* - Sun Oct 11 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ko-Ko(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: Their screams made me cum. - Sun Oct 11 02:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: So sandy. - Sun Oct 11 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Much sand. - Sun Oct 11 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: I shall make this village the village of love. - Sun Oct 11 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Indeed! - Sun Oct 11 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) landed atop a massive gathering of shattered pieces of rock, lowering Zephira from his bridal style carrying of her. He'd perform some basic stretches.

"It's slightly hotter here, but that only amplifies growth!"* - Sun Oct 11 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: No.... at least not yet.... - Sun Oct 11 03:02:36 2015

"SQUARE UP LIL NIGGA!"* - Sun Oct 11 03:03:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Speaking of hotter that is what you are! Or.. that doesn't make sense. You are a pretty individual though, Zephira-chan! - Sun Oct 11 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: You're quite youthful, as well! - Sun Oct 11 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Mhm! - Sun Oct 11 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) clasped her hand, pulling her close.

"I will take you under my wing to hone your youth!" He'd state, his left arm coiling around her mid-back and pressing her frame to his own. He grinned down at her confidently.* - Sun Oct 11 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) shook his head, beaming. "Youth may not be attained by reading books alone!"* - Sun Oct 11 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) lead the girl to the innards of his apartment.

"We will begin training tomorrow, rest here." He'd show her the guest bedroom, heading off to his own room.

"Good night to you!" He'd exclaim from his own room.* - Sun Oct 11 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Very well. - Sun Oct 11 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: That's the biggest hint I'll give to this journey... - Sun Oct 11 13:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: An adventure? Not quite, I must commence training! - Sun Oct 11 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: This adventure young lad.. - Sun Oct 11 13:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Follow the horizon to glory if y' seek it. - Sun Oct 11 13:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm ready to begin whenever. - Sun Oct 11 13:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) leaned forward, throwing his hands downward and pressing his palms against the earth, allowing his legs to go airborn. The male would stand on his hands, navigating back some so he could peer up at Zephira. "My horizon is my own, conjured by my youth!" He'd state, holding the handstand position for another thirty seconds, retracting and bending his arms as he did so, before transitioning into pushup position with a descension of heis legs from above him. The taijutsu specialist folded his left arm behind his back, performing one handed pushups with ease.* - Sun Oct 11 13:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Let's all leave then. - Sun Oct 11 13:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Hm...Shall we? - Sun Oct 11 13:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) bounced off of the ground, his right arm extending forth as he aimed to bring her into his grasp. He'd lift her into his arms bridal style and leap forth, heading off into the innards of Sunagakure.* - Sun Oct 11 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Alright! What is your specialty as a shinobi? - Sun Oct 11 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) settled her down beside him. He'd proceed to do leg exercises while he awaited for her answer. His pair of bushy brows came to a narrow as he intensified the amount of effort that he was investing into the leg stretches. It seemed as though the bowlcut adorning taijutsu specialist was always immersed in sweat and the essence of stamina.* - Sun Oct 11 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Welll~ - Sun Oct 11 13:53:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: But... - Sun Oct 11 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: What if I need your strength?... - Sun Oct 11 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Medical code number one is to never get into combat. - Sun Oct 11 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: ... Huh.. - Sun Oct 11 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: They have a code!? - Sun Oct 11 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: In that case, if you desire me to be your knight in armor I will happily accept that role! With that being said, I will simply be responsible with regulating your physical stability, rather than actually train you! - Sun Oct 11 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: It is none other than my duty to be the hard-working savior, the Green Beast of Sunagakure's duty, to protect you! - Sun Oct 11 13:59:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Hmph..More like drag me places. - Sun Oct 11 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Is that bad? What else should I do? - Sun Oct 11 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: It is my duty to bring protection and entertainment to a young maiden such as yourself! - Sun Oct 11 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: What did my father tell me to do in situations like this? Ah yes..! - Sun Oct 11 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Eh?..Hmm...Guess you're right. - Sun Oct 11 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) attempted to coil his left arm around her mid-back and pull her close, his right hand resting upon her chin and lifting it. He was a believer of inner beauty, because it was clear that the only part of him that was groomed was his hair and his teeth. Otherwise, his face was simply wiped down with a rag each morning. One of his teeth glimmered as he smiled down at her, one of his bushy brows lifting.

"So what shall satisfy you, Zephira?" He'd state, his voice a little rigid. He was nervous, unsure if his father's teachings of actions like this were being properly utilized.* - Sun Oct 11 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Tell me what shall satisfy you and I will accomplish the satisfaction! - Sun Oct 11 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) quirked a brow, not really noticing her blush. "What do a female and male do as business partners? Other than go and eat out at places?" He'd state, picking her up bridal style and heading off to a district dedicated to entertainment and outings. He'd lower her, simply clasping her hand and guiding her in a restaurant.* - Sun Oct 11 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) nodded lightly. "What do you like to eat, Zephira?" He'd question, peering at the menu as he settled down at a table, sitting across from her. His glistening grin was still noticeable.* - Sun Oct 11 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Fish and Hmm...Whats your taste actually? - Sun Oct 11 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Maybe I like to try something new? - Sun Oct 11 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Hm.. - Sun Oct 11 15:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: I do not have preferences for food. I like medium-rare meats! - Sun Oct 11 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: I'll take that then..With noodles added. - Sun Oct 11 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Oh and a milk shake! - Sun Oct 11 15:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) noticed the waitress when Zephira made her order.

"I will have steak and.. that will be all!"* - Sun Oct 11 15:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: A date.. ? - Sun Oct 11 15:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: You don't know what that is?... - Sun Oct 11 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: I do not. My father told me to treat maidens nicely, treat them to dinner, and be youthful with them, though! - Sun Oct 11 15:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Well... - Sun Oct 11 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: It's when a guy and a girl go someplace nice together. - Sun Oct 11 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: They try to get to know one another intimately.. - Sun Oct 11 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: And well, if the girl likes the boy  or the other way around, they kiss. - Sun Oct 11 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Like? Huh.. I like you. - Sun Oct 11 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: What's a kiss like, then!? Is it youthful? - Sun Oct 11 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) thinks: He's so innocent.. - Sun Oct 11 16:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: It's very youthful actually.. - Sun Oct 11 16:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Infact, women and men do it all the time. - Sun Oct 11 16:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Such a shame.. - Sun Oct 11 16:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: You havn't been kissed before have you? - Sun Oct 11 16:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: It's so delightful. - Sun Oct 11 16:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) thinks: He's going to take me on a thousand dates with this hehehe... - Sun Oct 11 16:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: I've never been kissed. So... dates are when people go to nice places? - Sun Oct 11 16:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: How is this not a date when you're a maiden and I'm a youthful lad? - Sun Oct 11 16:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Well...Um.. - Sun Oct 11 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: We're just eating.. - Sun Oct 11 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: If you wanna make it a date then.. - Sun Oct 11 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Buy me jello! And cake! - Sun Oct 11 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) thinks: But do I really want to manipulate an innocent guy? - Sun Oct 11 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: If that's what you want! - Sun Oct 11 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) watched as the waitress arrived with their food.

"I'd also like to get jello and cake for Zephira, kind miss!" He'd state, doing a partial bow with a dipping of his head.* - Sun Oct 11 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) started to eat his steak. He seemed delighted by it's taste.* - Sun Oct 11 16:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Right! I will do my best! - Sun Oct 11 16:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) finished eating his steak, looking rather filled up. He'd drift his gaze to the outside of the restaurant, staring aimlessly. The naive taijutsu specialist drifted his gaze toward Zephira, smiling with a gleam in one of his teeth if she noticed.* - Sun Oct 11 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: I'm going to bed soon...We';; date tomorrow, okay? - Sun Oct 11 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Alright. - Sun Oct 11 17:01:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Ooooo voices from people I don't know. . . Exciting. - Tue Oct 13 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) shot away in a rapid, impressive number of cartwheels.* - Tue Oct 13 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) approached Zephira, one of his teeth glinting as he genuinely grinned at her.

"Are you ready to begin youthful training!?" He'd ask, seemingly pumped up.* - Wed Oct 14 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) bent his knees and wrapped his left arm under the back of her knees, his right arm wrapping around her mid-back. He'd swoop her off her feet, jogging away.

"Time is of essence! It's too irresponsible not to resort to this!" He'd state, referring to the time he'd already spent waiting for a response.* - Wed Oct 14 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Time of training? Hm.. - Wed Oct 14 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Depends on how well you youself have trained right? - Wed Oct 14 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) placed her down on her feet. He'd start stretching his legs leisurely.

"Indeed! I've immersed myself in the most youthful fashions of training!"* - Wed Oct 14 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Heh,  I think you're over hyping the training alittle aren't you? - Wed Oct 14 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: We're youthful enough aren't we? - Wed Oct 14 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: There is never a limit of youth! It is a pillar that supports the foundation of villages! - Wed Oct 14 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: But what if we get old?! - Wed Oct 14 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Then we shall educate the new until they bloom into foundations of youth of their own. - Wed Oct 14 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) raised a single, two-inch thick brow. "Huh?" He'd ask, misunderstanding the expression that she just stated. He'd lift his arm up to his chest, giving her a thumbs up; he'd then follow up with a cheesy smile. "With my youth on my side I'll never lose myself! That is my pledge as the Green Beast of Sunagakure!" He'd announce to her.* - Wed Oct 14 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) subconsciously lead his hand that he used to give her a thumbs up to her left shoulder, pulling her closer lightly even if he didn't notice his own action. He'd be taken by surprise by the feeling of exuberance, satisfaction and even affection when she gave him the kiss on the lips. Izutora's eyes would noticeably dialate, his body going still. His hand would drift from her shoulder when she pulled away, his tongue wandering his mouth as though he was looking for any lingering signs of the brief, yet affectionate french kiss she gave ihm.

"Y..Yeah.. sure..!" He'd state, his genuine grin showing, though it was mixed with a faint sign of nervousness, rooted from that unexpected kiss.* - Wed Oct 14 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Good! Now What's the first?...Push ups? - Wed Oct 14 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Two hundred pushups! After that, fourty jumping jacks, followed by thirty situps! - Wed Oct 14 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Okay, think you can do that with me studying? - Wed Oct 14 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: give me them yamz - Wed Oct 14 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: omit - Wed Oct 14 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: I'll sit on your back during the push ups. - Wed Oct 14 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Hn.. - Wed Oct 14 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: That is fine by me! However, may I demonstrate a stretch that my dear father told me about? - Wed Oct 14 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Hm?..Sure. - Wed Oct 14 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: You're the expert. - Wed Oct 14 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) nodded lightly. He'd recall the words his father spoke, positioning himself so that he'd be kneeling in front of her while her back was to the ground, with his hands positioned to clasp against hers. The manner that he was near her would force her legs to be pushed aprat.

"I believe.. that my father may've mislead me with referring to this as a stretch... he said it preceded very youthful actions...!" He'd state, naive as ever.* - Wed Oct 14 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) widened his eyes. He'd clasp her hands firmly with his own, not really knowing what he was doing. He wasn't sure if he was doing anything wrong either. "Father told me it was!" He'd state, peering at the way both of them were positioned, easily noticing her panties. He'd shift his gaze back up to her face. "I apologize!" He'd announce, his body frozen in place. His stare pierced hers intensely.* - Wed Oct 14 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) stopped clasping her hands, simply pressing his hands to the ground. He was about to rise, but was suddenly captivated by her stare and her embarassed look. "Zephira. Is it youthful to feel warmer than I do after one thousand pushups when I look at you?" He'd question, intrigued by his own shift in emotions.* - Wed Oct 14 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) scooched away.

"I apologize! I simply didn't know that that was not a stretch up until I'd demonstrated it on you just now!" He'd state, bowing to her.* - Wed Oct 14 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Hmph!...I thought I..Was going to be raped at your hands.. - Wed Oct 14 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Rape? - Wed Oct 14 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: What did my father tell me to do when a young maiden was angry at me..? Uh... hmmmmmmmm... - Wed Oct 14 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: Mother and father both told me to do the same thing in situations like this... - Wed Oct 14 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: What's rape? - Wed Oct 14 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) leaned forward, cautiously guiding his arms around her, attempting to hug her from behind.

"Let me know if I'm doing this wrong! Both of my parents told me this is what you do when a maiden is angry at you! Tell me if I'm wrong, please!"* - Wed Oct 14 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) couldn't help but sniff at her hair, catching a whiff of it's scent. He wouldn't say anything about it though. He'd distance himself from the girl.

"So hugs are okay?" He'd ask.* - Wed Oct 14 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Mhm..They are.. - Wed Oct 14 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) nodded.

"Alright then! I'll hug you before we start training everyday! Now, get on my back!" He'd state, getting down into pushup-position, wiating for her to sit on his back.* - Wed Oct 14 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) attempted to fold his left arm behind his back, instead thwacking his palm against her thigh inadvertently. He'd retract his hand away from her. "I apologize! I've grown accustomed to one-handed pushups!" He'd state, simply pressing his palms to the earth. He'd eagerly begin his well-proportioned pushups. * - Wed Oct 14 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) felt as his hand slipped beneath her butt and thigh. Izutora would maintain a half-focused manner of performing the pushups. The taijutsu specialist wasn't having any struggles with the task, but rather with concentrating while his hand was constantly pressed between his back and her butt. Of course, being the naive individual he was, he was unaware of this feeling being natural, and unaware of it's cause. "I can't seem to concentrate.." He'd murmur, doing the pushups with great finesse at the same time.* - Wed Oct 14 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) faltered on one of the pushups from her action. The male was progressively getting more aroused, though he was completely oblivious of the arousal. The male continued doing the pushups, though they seemed a little more strained. Of course, the strain was him trying to maintain his progressively thinning concentration. "I... don't understand this sensation.." He'd utter.* - Wed Oct 14 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Explain more to me about romance! I do not understand and I wish to learn more about it. - Wed Oct 14 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) kept his left arm folded behind his back. He was easily able to maintain conversation while performing the pushups. The male would bend and extend his right arm outward with ease. Only a few beads of sweat left his well-toned frame as he completed the last of the pushups. The taijutsu specialist stood to his feet, beginning to do jumping jacks rapidly while counting them.* - Wed Oct 14 03:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: My father educated me on the male anatomy, but never told me about the female, nor any intimate things other than stretch positions. - Wed Oct 14 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: W-well... - Wed Oct 14 03:14:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: It's...A breathing exercise.. - Wed Oct 14 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) laid down on his back, closing his eyes. His arms rested at his sides.

"Should I start doing situps or something now?"* - Wed Oct 14 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: No..Just relax..Don't open your eyes till I say so, kay? - Wed Oct 14 03:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) whispers: Little moist don't you think? Pervy-san? - Wed Oct 14 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) whispers: It's strawberry scented~ - Wed Oct 14 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) opened his eyes, honestly surprised by what he saw.

"E-Eh..?" He'd murmur. The scent of strawberry filled his nostrils. His wide gaze would drift up at her.

"Zephira..." He'd utter.* - Wed Oct 14 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: H.. he didn't. - Wed Oct 14 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: What is it..? - Wed Oct 14 03:29:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Forgive me! - Wed Oct 14 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) rushed forth, attempting to clasp her hand.

"Zephira! It's fine!" He'd state.* - Wed Oct 14 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Zephira-chan! - Wed Oct 14 03:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: That is a question I do not know the answer to, I'm afraid. - Wed Oct 14 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You seem to be less energetic than normal.. - Wed Oct 14 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Anyway. I require a sparring partner of my level. Do you wish to engage me? - Wed Oct 14 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: I'd certainly be honored to. I am still  - Wed Oct 14 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Inexperienced at taijutsu. - Wed Oct 14 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: None the less, I will do my best not to fail your expectations! - Wed Oct 14 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Good then. Where do you wish to battle? - Wed Oct 14 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: It is your decision. - Wed Oct 14 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Oi. Taken. - Wed Oct 14 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: The left works just as fine. - Wed Oct 14 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) simply nodded to the female, bending his knees slightly. Izutora would eagerly rush toward the white haired female with intentions of leaping off of the earth and performing a quick spin while in midair. He was relatively swift when it came to his actions. He'd proceed to thrust his right leg out, aiming to get a firm strike on her torso with the sole of his foot. "Dynamic Entry!" He'd hollar galiantly.

The jumpsuit wearing taijutsu specialist was probably attacking and moving slower than she could react. The only leverage, if any, that he may've had, was the distinct scent of leaves and sweat on him.* - Wed Oct 14 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) couldn't really perceive her movements as she pretty much effotlessly evaded his attack. He couldn't set his gaze upon the rate that she was palm striking him either. Zap-like pain jolted throughout his leg, and he'd eagerly thrust it into the earth heel-first the moment she distanced herself from him. He'd throw his left leg into a tight bend, attempting to propel off of his right heel and somersault throughout the air.

He'd quickly attempt to drive his left heel into her right shoulder, aiming to pivot the direction of his leg as he'd spin, attempting to pull his leg away as he shot out his other one in a quick side kick fashion directed to her ankle, pulling that corresponding leg away and throwing out his other with intentions of hitting her in her lower stomach region. He'd spin one last time, the barrage of kicks granting him the buoyancy necessary for the technique as he attempted to thrash his foot into her abdomen.

"Leaf Great Whirlwind!"

More or less, if she avoided the dropkick he'd progress into the series of kicks, as it was a little more than a facade to perhaps stop her from inclining the distance between herself and the taijutsu specialist. He'd add a small glide to his ground movement if he needed to branch out the range of his attacks to make at least one hit!* - Wed Oct 14 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: Impressive! She must have physical capabilities if she bypassed my trained body! - Wed Oct 14 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) was knocked away, shouting as he did such. He'd slowly recuperate midair, and thus perform two somersaults to land standing straight a decent distance away from her, skidding across the ground a bit as he made his landing. Izutora would fold his left arm behind his back and extend his right arm out in front of him, bending said arm slightly while maintaining the cuffing of his fingers belonging to his open hand. The side of said open hand directed itself to Mirai.

"It's unwise to let your overconfidence get to you..!" He'd state, unraveling the gauze around his forearms some. "I will not allow my weaknesses to demoralize me!" The Green Beast shouted, rushing forth withhis arms thrown behind him. He'd eagerly attempt to follow her bodily movements with his decent eyesight, also trying to concentrate on the wind within the area. He didn't know how to anticipate if she was going to engulf herself in that spinning globe of chakra again.

He'd throw a punch at her abdomen, but swiftly attempt to shove himself to her right in a straight-line, attempting to manuever around her frame.* - Wed Oct 14 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) clenched his teeth, still trying to maintain close contact even if she had the advantage within it. Izutora attempted to endure the pain while he attempted to deal it with rapidly thrown kicks and punches that were still precise even if his concentration and focus was hindered by hte fact that the feeling in his right arm was going, and it was getting extremely stiff to a point that he was slowly becoming unable to move it.

"Grrrgh..! In the name of youth!" He'd shout with a strained tone, attempting to direct a more concentrated punch aimed at her jaw.* - Wed Oct 14 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) had just barely managed to maintain his footing from the immense amount of damage that she dealt to him. He'd clench his teeth, his right palm pressing to his stomach. He was nowhere near tired out, but the damage that she'd dealt to him had done quite a number. "I am fine, indeed!" He'd state to her, attempting to gear his attention away from the pain he was experiencing.* - Wed Oct 14 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Do your best to learn it, it's a pinnacle of youth! - Wed Oct 14 23:07:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Oh. You should train, yeah. - Wed Oct 14 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: I've completed a majority of my singular training for today, I'm afraid. - Wed Oct 14 23:17:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Indeed. - Wed Oct 14 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) leaned forth, pressing his hands to the earth and suspending his legs upward into the air. He had intentions of returning to the square walking on his hands.* - Wed Oct 14 23:23:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Someplace expensive ! *sticks tongue out* - Fri Oct 16 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yo, Ai. - Fri Oct 16 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hey butt Nurse who is your friend. - Fri Oct 16 20:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) peered at the yen in his possession.

"Sure!" He'd state, attempting to clasp Zephira's hand and head off to attend to training.* - Fri Oct 16 20:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yo. - Fri Oct 16 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Wonder who butt nurse is. - Fri Oct 16 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: How're you? - Fri Oct 16 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Hello Susumu. . . - Fri Oct 16 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hello, Marrisa. - Fri Oct 16 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Sh, Kilm! - Fri Oct 16 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: How're you doing today? - Fri Oct 16 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I need to talk to you! - Fri Oct 16 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm? - Fri Oct 16 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Fri Oct 16 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: This looks like a bad cry for help. - Fri Oct 16 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Licorsih Jumpman and Butt Nurse where have you guys been? - Fri Oct 16 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) picked up Zephira bridal-style as he usually did. "Gotcha!" He'd state. The male would bend his knees some then lean his torso forth. In a brisk acceleration of movement he'd move forward in a jog. The male would quickly head off to his destination. It seemed he held no ambition to remain within the courtyard any longer. Izutora's growth was astounding. Though it seemed no one would notice.* - Fri Oct 16 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We can talk privately then. - Fri Oct 16 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am fine Susumu, and I'll get back with you in a bit - Fri Oct 16 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I've been sleeping, Trilliam. - Fri Oct 16 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: And alright. - Fri Oct 16 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: If Sazea wakes up, tell her to wait here for me - Fri Oct 16 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) exhaled lightly! He'd lower Zephira down onto her feet, looking boldly up at the tree. "Today I shall perform situps while the backs of my knees are on the branch!" He'd explain to Zephira. The male would attempt to coil his arms around the redhead, before taking a great leap and landing on the tree. "I wish for you to sit on my ankles so I don't break position!" He'd inform her.

The male made sure she was stable with standing on the branch, before arriving at it's thickest area and proceeding to press the backs of his kneecaps to it's surface. He'd hang the entirety of his body beyond said kneecaps off of the tree branch, his arms thrown out beyond his head. Izutora would simply wait for her to do what he asked. If she refused or didn't even respond, he'd proceed to start doing the situps, his arms intersecting and his hands pressed to their opposing shoulders.* - Fri Oct 16 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: I hope that random feeling I got before doesn't intercept my workout! - Fri Oct 16 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) maintained his position and ensured that there were no faults to the manner that he was laying, or else that could be costly for either himself, Zephira, or both of them. Izutora would respond to her with no delay to his speech as he performed situps rapidly, his muscles tensing up each time he did so. "No worries! I will catch you if you fall!" He would holler promisingly. He easily completed fifty situps without any signs of fatigue. The male's levels of stamina were as youthful as he.* - Fri Oct 16 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued to perform the situps as much as possible. The male applied his advantage muscle-wise, in addition to his well-toned body to the test. Not only that, but he wanted to see just how long he could go with his reserves of stamina. The taijtusu specialist would lurch forth completely with each situp. Not once did his position falter. Izutora glimpsed at the redhead sitting on his ankles every few rises.* - Fri Oct 16 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) was finally showing signs of getting slightly fatigued. He'd continue to lean forth briskly, counting the amount of situps in his head. His arms remained pressed to the surface of his upper torso while he did the action. Once achieving a total of three hundred situps he would simply hang there, before lurching forward. The male would look to Zephira face to face with a cheeky grin.

"Thanks for the help, as always!" Izutora would state. His arms flung forward as he attempted to embrace the girl lightly, recalling that she said she had no issue with being hugged. He'd just have to suffer the consequences if that was a faux statement.* - Fri Oct 16 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) pulled her closer to him. "Wrap your legs around me for a moment." The bushy browed boy stated momentarily. He wouldn't progress with his actions until she did so. After she did, the bowlcut wearing boy slowly slid forth on the branch. He'd slide off the edge, landing beside the tree trunk. Izutora would remove his arms from around her, then proceed to nod at her question.

"I definitely can!" He'd state, folding his left arm behind his back and extending his bent right arm out in front of him, standing up straight and slowly preparing himself mentally for more training, his beaty circular stare focused on the rather linky looking, dark brown tree.* - Fri Oct 16 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) rushed forth eagerly and proceeded to throw his right arm forward, extending it out completely. He thrashed his knuckles against the tree, leaving an indent with the powerful strike. He'd speak while proceeding to recede his right arm and throw another attack with his left, indenting the vicinity of the trunk that he struck with his left fist. "You talk lots about losing yourself. Bad run in with it in the past?" Izutora questioned, suddenly whipping his right leg upright and hitting the tree with the left side of his ankle as he threw his leg up after hitting the tree half a dozen times.* - Fri Oct 16 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Losing TO yourself... - Fri Oct 16 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: As in giving up... - Fri Oct 16 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Ah.... - Fri Oct 16 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: That makes sense! - Fri Oct 16 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: But, do you say that because you've given up sometimes? Is that your ninja way or something, to never give up? - Fri Oct 16 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Mhm, I've given up too many times.. - Fri Oct 16 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Oh. Okay! - Fri Oct 16 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Is your stomach incapable of going unfilled, yet, Zephira? - Sat Oct 17 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Hm? No.. - Sat Oct 17 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: More training it is! - Sat Oct 17 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: I must test my new limits in strength..! - Sat Oct 17 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) attempted to pull Zephira into an embrace, before lifting her off her feet while holding her close. He'd ascend and descend her lightly within his grasp.

"Hmmm... either you've gotten lighter or I've grown physically stronger!"* - Sat Oct 17 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) took a brief moment to subconsciously glimpse at her frame, finding the weird feeling that he developed before begin to return. He suddenly felt something jab at his crotch. That, or his crotch jabbed something, or in this case, it jabbed Zephira. Izutora would release her from his grip rather quickly, attempting to cover up his confusion. The taijutsu specialist began to do pushups, which only exposed the proof of his manhood more.

<Darn it! I'm consuming my stamina, I cannot focus!> He'd think to himself.* - Sat Oct 17 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm, that should make Yan happy. - Sat Oct 17 19:07:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: For security purposes, no one is allowed to enter the village with a mask on unless authorized by Hassan himself. - Sat Oct 17 19:18:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) leaned forward, pressing the base of his palms to the earth and throwing his legs into the air. He began to walk off to the far, upper right of the village, the area that he'd been in for awhile. He maintained perfect positioning while he performed the handstand. Izutora would remove one palm from the earth and apply pressure to the one palm he was balancing on, essentially hopping out of the way of people that were obstacles to his practices of taijutsu.* - Sat Oct 17 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He's busy, but you will see him soon I imagine. - Sat Oct 17 19:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Make haste. - Mon Oct 19 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) lifted a brow in what seemed to be confusion. Said brow was two inches thick, as was his other. "Wha? This is the epitome of youth and fashion sense, Zephira!" He'd practically plead. He didn't seem to understand why she was making a deal out of his appearance now, unlike before.* - Mon Oct 19 23:21:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) blinked. "Do I get a prize out of this?" He'd question, uncharacteristically dry-toned. He'd stare at her with his mime-like gaze, before grinning and throwing his arm out, performing the nice guy pose with a gleam to his tooth. "I will think on it as I complete my task! Do your best on yours, Zephira!" He'd state to the female.* - Mon Oct 19 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Hmph! - Mon Oct 19 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) cocked a brow at Zephira as she waved and headed on her way. Izutora would throw his arms toward his feet, proceeding to throw his legs into the air and suspend his body in the air by performing a handstand. He'd press his gauze-covered palms to the earth. The bowl-cut adorning individual would start to walk on his hands away from the location, heading to the gates of the village. Judging by the lack of stamina-exertion he intended to do a lap around the village while spectating it's perimeter as Muhhammed told him to.* - Mon Oct 19 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) finally exited through the gate. The male would enjoy the breeze of the sand around him. None the less, that didn't distrac thim from his true purpose for being outside. Izutora would proceed to move forth slightly quicker while in a handstand on his hands. The male would peer around the gates, making sure that there was nothing unexpected. He'd keep a -very- good watch, well-aware of what was occuring, if anything.* - Mon Oct 19 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued to move around the perimeter of the village. The bowlcut adorning individual in the meantime would think about Zephira said. He found that during most of his exercises he was thinking about Zephira more. The black-haired male continued to travel on the outside of the gates while looking around the entirety of the village. So far he hadn't seen anything, so that was a very good sign.* - Mon Oct 19 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued trailing around the outer part of Sunagakure. The belt-like headband around his waist with Sunagakure's emblem on it prevented any suspicion. He'd count each movement that he did with his hands, while moving forward. At the same time, his gaze was focused around the premises around him. The bowlcut boy was very-into doing this type of training, especially when it helped him complete the mission.* - Mon Oct 19 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) would swivel on his palm out of nowhere. He'd press his hand -firmly- against the ground, before pushing himself upright and spinning around upsidedown throughout the air. This, essentially, made him look like one large green corkscrew. Izutora landed on the straight pathway to the perimeter of the village. Every odd-shift in the village's perimeter was difficult for him to motion around.* - Mon Oct 19 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) continued to move along the perimeter of Sunagakure in a walking handstand. His pair of beaty-eyes set themselves onward, scanning his vicinity every moment or two. He was dedicated to this mission. Such a youthful person such as himself was making sure he wouldn't fail with the task he was assigned to. Maybe that was why Muhhammed gave him it.* - Tue Oct 20 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) was beginning to feel slightly tired out from his travels. He'd swing his feet down toward the ground, pressing the edges of his feet to the earth. The male would stand to his feet, roaming throughout his backpouch and pulling forth a water bottle. He'd sip on the water bottle, his gaze set to perceive everything around him, regardless if the sand blocked his way. Izutora would proceed to jog forward.* - Tue Oct 20 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) gulped down the remnants of his water bottle while jogging across the southern perimeter of Sunagakure. The male would place the bottle of water within the beige backpouch attached to his lower back. The bowl-cut accentuated individual would proceed to bend his knees and lean forward, his beaty gaze coming to a narrow as he threw his arms out behind him. He shot off as fast as possible, breezing forward at full-speed.* - Tue Oct 20 00:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: We should wait for someone to come and get us? I don't... think we can walk like that. - Tue Oct 20 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Didn't they invite us here? - Tue Oct 20 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Yes... - Tue Oct 20 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But just making sure. - Tue Oct 20 00:08:57 2015
