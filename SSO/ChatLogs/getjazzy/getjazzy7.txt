Regardless.. his teeth couldn't bypass Izutora's developed frame, made for putting up with hand to hand combat. He'd find that he fell victim to Zephira's OCD for fashion, sitting and observing as she changed his appearance.

"Please go out with me, Zephira!" He'd state with exuberance in his tone, squinting and lurching his head forth, attempting to lock lips with her. He was returning the action of affection that she gave him before; he had attentions of kissing her unexpectedly as she did to him.* - Wed Oct 21 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) wrapped his arms around her waist, smiling down at her.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) drifted an agape gaze toward Yoko, mostly focusing on the blood covering her form. He'd scan her frame for any signs of injuries, but at the same time he directed his attention to her. Izutora would lift one of his now, normally-sized brows upright, before asking in a voice consisting of concern and beguilement.

"Are you.. okay, young maiden?" He'd question.* - Thu Oct 22 02:18:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) thinks: What an eye sore.. - Thu Oct 22 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) could feel daggers piercing into the side of his head, a bodily response response to someone glaring at him.

"I am sorry if I managed to intimidate you! I am Izutora of the Sabara, the Green Beast of Sunagakure!" He'd state, introducing himself. He'd redirect his attention to Yoko; he suddenly looked at her in what seemed to be confusion.

His mouth would become a flat line and he'd blink. "Is there a problem, young maiden?" He'd ask, with absolutely -zero- malice behind the question. It was genuine. He'd peer at Mai once more.* - Thu Oct 22 03:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) nodded some.

"I understand that.. I hope your opinion of me changes! I wish not to be your enemy, only your ally!" He'd state,  bowing to Yoko, his visage directed to her, rather than the ground. If he was a few months more inexperienced, he probably would've been bowing with his gaze directed to the ground. He was improving.* - Thu Oct 22 03:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) approached her, this time less quickly. He'd extend his right arm out, attempting to shake Mai's hand. Yet another gleaming smile would emanate from his facial features, which were noticeably more alluring than they were when he was rocking a bowlcut and two-inch eyebrows. It seemed he was hiding lots of handsomeness. His well-toned body was already exposed by his unbuttoned, highschool-esque green jacket.* - Thu Oct 22 03:28:38 2015
