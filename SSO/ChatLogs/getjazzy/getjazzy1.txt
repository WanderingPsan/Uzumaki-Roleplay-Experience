<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukitani, Alice(Get Jazzy) took a brief glance at Kirie, somewhat curious of her. Alice's captivation by the snowy-haired female's appearance was short-lived, and the Yukitani girl soon directed the focal point of her sky blue irises to her right.* - Tue Sep 15 17:33:39 2015

While it was impressive, Alice had no desire to specialize in sealing, so all seeing this display did was make her question Kirie's strength. The girl remained as silent as ever.* - Tue Sep 15 17:42:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukitani, Alice(Get Jazzy) exhaled slightly. She'd run her oddly sharp fingernail across her pointer finger, drawing blood. She pressed her hand against the wall behind her, producing a small-rodent from a plume of smoke. The rodent, a Capybara in specific, would climb upon her shoulder, it's beaty eyes shifting in minor unease from left to right.* - Tue Sep 15 18:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukitani, Alice(Get Jazzy) shifted her gaze over to Yan. She didn't find anything interesting about him, though that was the case for most people in her vicinity. Alice nodded silently, rubbing the small rodent's head, shifting her sights toward Yan briefly, scanning his frame once more. The Yukitani girl looked at the rodent, while responding to the Sunagakure shinobi.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukitani, Alice(Get Jazzy) nodded in acknowledgement of what he'd stated. She attempted to form the proper handsign but had it completely off. The girl parted her hands, then formed the seal again, this time properly utilizing it. From that point she attempted to halt the flow of her chakra. She had managed to do it, though she stopped the process of halting her chakra early, thus rendering her attempts useless as she tried to surge it in order to successfully use the technique.

She frowned, noticing that her inability to properly utilize her chakra was because she improperly formed the seal again. She cautiously positioned her hands, then attempted to conjure the handsign. Eagerly, she'd halt the flow of her chakra, or attempt to, this time failing completely on that step. Her eagerness had stopped her from noticing her failure of using the technique. The girl frowned, parting her hands slowly.

Once more, she would form the handsign. This time she had properly positioned her fingers, and their position hadn't faltered afterward. The blue haired girl proceeded to halt the flow of her chakra with incredible ease. In one swift moment shortly after halting it she surged it in one go. With certainty, she had properly learned how to dissipate Genjutsu. She didn't know for sure, but she had a feeling the sresults were satisfactory since she had properly formed the seal.

Her inexperience was clear, specifically with how terrible her hand-eye coordination, as well as dexterity, was.* - Tue Sep 15 20:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukitani, Alice(Get Jazzy) slowly manipulated her fingers into the shape of a handsign, accurately performing it. Alice proceeded to halt the flow of her chakra. Shortly after doing such she would proceed to surge her chakra when the moment came. She was still inefficiently using the technique, though, as she was using way more excess chakra for it than necessary. She could slowly notice her efficiency with the technique growing, though.* - Tue Sep 15 21:09:32 2015

From a plume of smoke emerged a rodent. The Capybara rested on her right shoulder while she formed a single handseal, halting her chakra flow then proceeding to surge it. Practicing her techniques was key to mastering them. It was clear that she was very good at training, considering she'd done it for years.

Alice ran her hand through her hair, watching the furry small rodent scamper across the ground, climbing upon the white post nearby and simply looking around with it's beaty eyes. The blue haired female was curious as to what would be wise hwen it came to having summons out. She wasn't sure if she should feed it, attempt to talk to it, or simply leave it alone. Her blue eyes flickered right and left, then back down at her lap.

She would proceed to form the proper handseal once more. After doing such she'd halt hte flow of her chakra with great ease. Her skill at utilizing the genjutsu dissipation technique was becoming greater. She suddenly surged her chakra, parting her hands and resting them against the ground below. She seated herself on a bench that was nonexistent in her OOC location, paying close attention to the Capybara she summoned.* - Tue Sep 15 22:18:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukitani, Alice(Get Jazzy) nodded. She'd eagerly clasp her hands together, surging her chakra and focusing it in a thin veil at the soles of her feet. She'd begin to dash toward the water eagerly, clearly intending to see if she'd done it successfully. There was a massive unbalance within the chakra that she had focused into her feet. Luckily enough, she skid to a stop, taking a moment to think. She extended her right leg out, dipping her foot down toward the surface of the water.

She grumbled slightly when she noticed that the tip of her foot submerged underwater. She pulled her leg awya from the water, placing her damp foot flatly against the ground. "I guess I didn't do it right afterall." Despite the shame of failing, a brief smile was printed on her features. She'd clasp her hands together once more, engulfing the soles of her feet in chakra. Once again, the amount of chakra invested was unbalanced. She extended her leg out once more, pressing her foot out to the water, frowning as it submerged.

"What am I doing wrong..?" The blue haired girl uttered, puffing her cheeks slightly. The Yukitani girl would giggle slightly. It seemed that she had a dunce-like tendency to her. "Ah... I never balanced out my chakra.." She'd remark. A smirk manifested itself upon her thin lips as she placed one palm against the other, proceeding to draw out chakra from her reserves. This time, she balanced out the chakra, then proceeded to part her palms, resting her arms at their sides.

Alice would extend her right leg out in front of her, pressing the tip of her foot against the water. She would place her foot flatly against the water, proceeding to walk forth a few steps. When she took a moment or two to applaud herself excitely, she lost her focus, causing the chakra in her feet to unbalance once more. This time, she wasn't lucky, and thus she fell directly into the water, being submerged two or more feet before arising, climbing to the edge of the lake and getting out, seemingly exasperated, now that her clothing was wet.

"Gosh... I see what you mean by -constant- flow." The girl would state. She'd bite her finger, pressing her hand against the ground after crouching down on her knees. From a plume of smoke emerged a capybara. "Go get me spare clothing, please.." She'd whisper to the small rodent, watching as it scampered off quickly. In the meantime she'd await, running her hand through her now wet hair.

The rodent returned, a folded up white hoodie beneath it's long, menacing incisors. It dropped the hoodie, returning to the domain it was originally at before she conjured it via. her blood. She'd pull the hoodie over her, patting it slightly. "Alright... !"* - Thu Sep 17 22:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukitani, Alice(Get Jazzy) would closely watch what Lera did. She closely inspected the handsign that the female performed. After watching her release the stream of Fuuton-based chakra, Alice was slightly impressed. She'd smile lightly, before forming the seal herself, and proceeding to gather Fuuton-composed chakra. She'd attempt to release the chakra in the form of a stream from her palm.

Unfortunately she'd formed the handseal for the technique incorrectly. Thus, no sudden gust of wind emanated from her palm. She found herself slightly embarassed, as well as slightly exasperated due to her own failure. The blue haired girl formed the handsign once more, proceeding to knead raw chakra into wind and process it. This time, she'd try to release it from her mouth. The most she did was blow with the gathered oxgen in her mouth, but other than that a stream of Fuuton didn't emit from her maw.

She was a very impatient person, but was also stubborn. She didn't give into her failures like others would've by then. Alice formed the proper handsign, surging her chakra one last time. "I have to do it this time..." She'd murmur, before building up fuuton-based chakra in her mouth, puffing her cheeks. She'd release a stream of Fuuton-based chakra from her maw.

"Wind Release: Godly Wind from the Mountains!" She'd shout, releasing the impressive vortex of wind.* - Sat Sep 19 02:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yukitani, Alice(Get Jazzy) watched all five of the handsigns be performed. She would proceed to observfe the immense amount of Fuuton-based chakra be released in what seemed to be one go. Alice would nod briefly, before performing the five handsigns herself. She kneaded Fuuton-composed chakra within her, puffing up her cheeks. The girl attempted to release the immense amount of chakra from her maw. Unfortunately, Mitsuru's useless flirting distracted her, and instead she wasted all of the chakra by not releasing it quick enough.

None the less, the blue haired girl would form the handsigns once more. This time she was more careful, and much more aware of what she was doing. Alice would proceed to knead the chakra within her chest. She'd puff up her cheeks, releasing a very small gust of charka. The gust of Fuuton-composed chakra was equivalent to that of the Godly Wind from the Mountains technique, in other words, very weak.

She grumbled slightly, forming several handsigns once more. She'd surge her chakra. Shortly after she'd knead it, then proceed to concentrate it within her chest. She pumped her chest out, puffing up her cheeks. This time she didn't let Mitsuru's flirtacious ways with Lera distract her. Instead she would proceed to release the immense chakra in the form of a massive blast of Fuuton.* - Sat Sep 19 02:47:53 2015
