<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) brought his hands up to execute the Concealment handseal as she kneed and molded his chakra within his stomatch, he would open his mouth and began releasing a pearly white mist that would slowly begin to cover the area. It was clear that by the thickness of the mist that the male had spend time mastering the technique as he would banish from sight as the mist finished setting upon the area. Of course to everyone bellow his rank they would not be able to detect him and those who were above his rank would be able to tell where he was as soon as he approached them.* - Mon Sep 28 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) would have received a gust of wind to the face as his mist was blown away >Well shit.< he thought to himself as she stared at Hassan "I would not necesarily call myself an assassin as I do not really specialize in that. Like I said I use fuuinjutsu." He would bring up his right hand and extended out his index finger focusing chakra into it, crouching down and bringing his finger down to the sand he would carve the emblem of his clan on the sand.* - Mon Sep 28 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) arrived at said private spot and looked at the wall. He would glance back at Hassan and smirked then he would look at the wall and began to focus his chakra on his head. If Hassan was a sensor he would have been able to rell what he was doing but if he wasnt then he would just see him standing there looking at the wall for a bit. Suddenly out of his hair three massive chains would appear and shoot out toward the wall that was infront of them causing three large holes where each of the chain endings would hit. Once he was done he would drop to a knee from the amount of chakra he had just used up and would begin panting "Shit." she would mutter to himself as the chains disappeared into thin air.* - Mon Sep 28 02:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) walked into the area with a scroll in hand "I have finished the mission." he simply said as he adjusted his 'new' scarf that he got from a store in sunagakure. He would extend his hand out with a scroll over to Hassan to turn in his report.* - Mon Sep 28 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) Walked up to the gate after recovering the chakra he had used up in that demonstration >Not doing that again.<  he thought to himself as she found the person he was going to show around the village "Welcome to Sunagakure." she told the person who was a female in her late thirties "My name is Uzumaki, Arashiyama, I will be your tour guide." he told the female all not that enthusiasticly. The female would look at him and smiled then proceeded to ask many questions which he did not really know the answer to.
* - Mon Sep 28 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) Walking through the village she would begin showing the female around starting at the Kazekage mansion "This is where the Nadaime Kazekage Muhhamed Hassan will be staying, from here he will direct all operations within the village and it is up to use shinobi to follow and execute every one of his orders. We are also required to make sure that the citizens of this village are well protected and as you can see from this mission I was assigned to we are also to ensure that the tourism of the village grows so that more revenue can come to the village."* - Mon Sep 28 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) After answering some questions the female had he would move toward the academy which looked just like every other building that was in Sunagakure as they were all constructed from mud and clay due to the conditions of the village and the geographical area in which it was located. "This is the academy, here we hope to train young children into excellent shinobi that will one day serve and protect this village against any potentia attackers that might want to take over it and harm its citizens." As he finished saying that the bell would have rung letting the kids out of class and they would all walk out of the academy.* - Mon Sep 28 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) "How many children are enrolled?" asked the female she was showing around. He would look at her with an -Are you fucking serious face- and turned around to face the school to see how many kids he could count >One, two, three, four, five.........ten........fifteen............twenty......twenty two......wait no I counted that kid already...fuck.< it became apparent to him that counting the kids would not really work out for him so he did the next best thing he could think of and motioned for the female to follow him inside of the school.* - Mon Sep 28 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) Once inside he would show her around the instalation which would be entirely different from the outside as it looked much more modern and civilized "There are several classrooms here in this academy from what you can see each one holding a different grade of potential shinobies." He proceeded to show the female all the classrooms that were slowly being unoccupied and to finish off the tour of the school he would show her to the main office where he asked how many students had been enrolled and when he got his answer he would proceed to tell the female.* - Mon Sep 28 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) Once outside of the hospital he would take her to the nearest hotel "This concludes the tour I can give you. I hope you have enjoyed and learned about this village. I hope that you enjoy the rest of your stay here in Sunagakure. The female would smile and thank him and went inside the hotel. >Never doing that again.< he thought to himself as he began walking toward the Kazekage mansion to turn in the mission report of the mission he had just been assigned.* - Mon Sep 28 03:57:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) brought his hands up to execute the Concealment handseal as he kneeded and molded his chakra inside of his stomatch >This heat is a real pain in the ass.< he thought to himself as he was doing this. Opening his mouth he released a pearly white mist that quickly began to cover the area but it would not be as effective due to the fact that they were in the middle of the desert but that would not stop it from obstructing people view. He would take a step back and banished into the mist disappearing from sight.

He would walk diagonally to the left heading toward Trilliam since he could not really see him while he was inside the mist >I cant see shit.< he thought to himself as she made his way across the sand while hidden in the mist "Let's hope that he does not move.< he thought to himself since it was more or less a cat and mouse game at this point since he did not have any extraordinary sensing abilities and did not know if Trilliam was a sensory ninja or not.* - Mon Sep 28 23:41:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) for all intents, sakes and purposes he was hit by the mist as using it in the first place without having any sensing capabilites was stupid so he would get zapped having his body spas for a couple of seconds then would turn around and said "Ok, I give." as loud as he could without making it a scream.* - Tue Sep 29 00:13:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) made sure he had enough water for the journey he was going to take with his newly appointed squad and set out for the gates of Sunagakure. When he arrived he would turn to face both Taiga and Kang "Well this is our first mission, let us try to not fuck this up understood?" with that he would turn and set out toward the outsposts. He would have a hat on to block the sun as well as a coat to prevent his skin from being sunburnt >This fucking heat.< he thought to himself as he made his way toward their destination occasionally glancing back at the two other to make sure they were still following behind him.* - Wed Sep 30 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) glanced back as Kang spoke and did not say anything as he did not really mind him wearing the mask. When they arrived at the outpost/village he would stop at the gates if the village had any and would enter once they were opened, making his way toward the central administration building he would ask to speak to the person incharge of the village and would show them the scroll from the Kazekage and would speak with them for several minutes trying to get on his good side to start off a good relationship between the outpost and sunagakure. After thirty minutes to an hour later he would have shaken the elders hand and began to make his way toward the entrance of the village with both his squadmates following behind him.* - Wed Sep 30 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) headed toward the next village which was an easy task but the scenery never really changed as they were travelling in a desert >This is depressing.< he thought to himself as he saw the outpost/village in the horizon and quickened the pace to get to their destination. Once they made it to the village he would reach for the canteen that was next to his backpouch and took a sip from it then took her hat off and poured some water on his hair >Its hot.< he said to himself as he placed his hat back on and amde his way toward the place where the village elder was located and began to repeat the process he had just done a couple of hours ago with the same village. As he showed the scroll to the elder he did not have the same luck with this elder as he did with the past one since this one refused to agree so easily. After several hours of of talking, argueing and laughed they finally came to an agreement that was finalized with a handshake. Making his way out of the building he would pick up Kang and Taiga along the way and would head toward the third and final village.* - Wed Sep 30 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) looked at Kang and shook his head "You eat it." he told him as he reached for his canteen again and placed it on his back then proceeded to make his way to the next village. "How are you guys holding up? Hang in a little longer, the next outpost/village should not be far away. You should be able to rest there." He would be concerned for his new squadmates since he had to look after them but there was only so much he could do at the moment since he was just getting to know them. When they arrived at the final village/outpost he would order them rest as he went and spoke tot he village elder. Showing him the scroll and repeating the same process he had done with the other two village elders he managed to strike a deal and would make his way to the other to restock on their supplies, mostly water as that was an essencial thing in the desert.* - Thu Oct  1 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uzumaki, Arashiyama(HidariOP) Walked out of the village and made his way back to suna "Hmmm?" He would say as he glanced at Kang "About me? There is really not much to say. I come from the Uzumaki clan, I have three brothers and Noriko is a cousing of ours or something." that was all the information he would reveal since he had done some more than questionable stuff in his lifetime due to his insanity. Arriving at Sunagakure he would make his way past the gates and headed straight to where people would always hang out as that was were Hassan would most like be at. Turning in a scroll with his report on the mission he would turn to Taiga and Kang "Good job you two, keep this up and I am sure that we will get more missions." he told them as a way to encourage them "Also do not forget your training, that is important as well."* - Thu Oct  1 00:21:20 2015
