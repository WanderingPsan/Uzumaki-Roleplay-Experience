<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tsukinomi(Original Ziare) stood in front of the empty classroom and got down to traiing some of her techniques then and there. She needed to master the summoning jutsu now while she still had the oportunity.

Tsuki bit into the tip of her thumb and praced the way to bounce chakra off of the base of her palm. It was the art of bouncing chakra off of her palm that she had trouble doing.

Tsuki continued the practice for bouncing chakra off of her palm. There were only five handseals and if she was able to truely bounce the chakra off of itself quickly there would be no downtime to her jutsu

Once again she bounced chakra off of the base of her palm. She had exellent chakra control and was able to do things like this with ease, but it was not fast enough for her liking.

Tsuki heald her hand out and bounced more chakra off of her palm, she was using so much chakra at this point she could see it without her Byakugan, and hat s when it hit her.

Tsuki activated her byakugan to see the chakra pathways and watch how her chakra seemingly moved across her hand. She nodded to herself as she watched the way her chakra moved.
