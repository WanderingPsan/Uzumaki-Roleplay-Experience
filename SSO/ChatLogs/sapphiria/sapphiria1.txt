<br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) stared blankly in the direction of the wall, was she admiring the paint work or the architecture? Who knows... Chi herself was simply just bored to the point her lips parted and her jaw seperated into producing a rather cosmetic yawn - it looked like a big yawn but hardly any sound was produced during the inital stage of the yawn but the final stages of the yawn with her mouth closing produced a faint 'Hnng' sound... it was evident with her glazed over eyes just how lacking her life was right now.* - Mon Oct 26 10:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Ortho, you wouldn't happen to know any water techniques, would you? - Mon Oct 26 11:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I know only three. - Mon Oct 26 11:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Consisting of? - Mon Oct 26 11:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Raging Waes, Watergun, Syrup and Water Shockwave. - Mon Oct 26 11:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's four, isn't it..? - Mon Oct 26 11:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Oh, I know two of those. - Mon Oct 26 11:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) moved her left hand up from her side and positioned it inwards towards her belly-button as she slid it into an opening to her kimono - it took a mere second for Chi's hand to enter her Kimono and exit it and the moment it started to back out of the opening she'd reveal a circular nut pinched between the tip of her index finger and thumb.

Once her hand was a mere inch away from her stomach and kimono she'd flex her wrist back before flicking her wrist back in sync with her index finger and thumb releasing their grip on the singular nut - allowing it to gain flight and go air-borne.

Its destination was obvious from the trajectory in which it was flinged towards and the response of Chi's mouth parting to welcome such a goodie; and thus the nut was devoured the single nut... glory.

All the while watching the two to her front... interesting.* - Mon Oct 26 11:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) offered the single nut a few rotations of her jaw accompanied with her teeth working their job in order to crush the nut down before using her mouth muscles and pushing it to the back of her throat and promptly to be swallowed.

Her tongue did the final job of the eating session, swiping left and right to pluck out the fragments of nut still remaining in her mouth - all the while continuing as Ortho acknowledged and greeted her and in return Chi's lips parted to bare her pearly white canines spare a speck of nut here and there as she spoke out in a soft voice... "Not sharing." was all that Chi spoke out as her hand reached in for yet another nut - once again aiming to flick it into her mouth.

Will it reach its destination?!* - Mon Oct 26 11:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) waited until the nut succesfully made its transition from her hand and into her mouth - once again chewing down on it but instead of waiting to swallow it before speaking she did two in one, speak while she continued eating - essentially leading to some slurred speech.

"Nuts and Chi." Chi muttered out with her head tilting forward and down before coming back up - nodding once.

* - Mon Oct 26 11:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) continued to eat and swallow her nuts with her left hand moving in and out of her kimono at a safe pace - all but one thing stopped Chi's favourite pass time... eating... salty... nuts. And that very thing was that there were no more nuts in her kimono evident by her left hand sliding out of her kimono with a empty plastic bag in-hand spare a few specks of salt and nut fragments.

With that the young girl's left hand pulled the plastic bag along to her side before promptly releasing her grasp on the bag and allowing it to fall - she just littered in public without any remorse as her left hand continued on its journy back to her mouth only to position itself directly near her pale-pinkish lips as they parted to have a tongue exit and lick at her own hand akin to a lollipop as she collected the salted nuts' remains on her the hand she used to take said nuts out of the packet.

All the while her gaze remained on Ortho - sparing to pause a lick here and there to speak towards the male.. "Okay. Pleasure is all yours.... tis' name is Chi." Chi said this only to return to the licking of her hand, scaling her tongue up and down the side of her hand, across her palm and even her fingers and once her hand was nut-free she moved it down to her side only to dry her hand off with her kimono.

How very slobbish.* - Mon Oct 26 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) || Even though the sarcasm was obvious it still went over her head as she tilted her head slightly to the side as she lifted her left arm up and over her head in order to expose her armpit to her nose in which she took two large whiffs - the first one forced her nose to wrinkle up in confusion and the second results in a faint cough being produced.

Following that Chi dropped her left arm back to her side only to lift her right arm up and over her head before doing the exact same - this time it was a cough the first time around and another the second time around.

And thus the young girl returned her focus to the male, "... Thank you." was all that Chi said in a quiet tone - did she take it as a compliment? If Ortho had a keen nose or entered the general area around Chi he'd notice that she didn't smell bad but smelled of sunflowers... the coughing caused from Chi's poor ability to stand smells.* - Mon Oct 26 12:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Of course. - Mon Oct 26 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) 's focus was on Ortho the entire time as the scroll passed between Kana and to Ortho - a single though got pressed into the young girl's mind as she moved her left hand back into her kimono for a mere three seconds as her hand rummaged around the depths for something - that something came to light as soon as she pulled her left hand out to reveal a collective amount of ryo in her open palm tallying a random amount... for those with keen eyes and equally keen math skills the amount tallied to one hundred and sixteen yen.

The moment Chi took out the ryo she stepped forth aiming to walk a small distance in order to close the gap between herself and Ortho and if succesful in doing so she'd proceed to extend her left hand out, presenting the yen towards the male.

"Trade for nuts." Chi muttered out, she thought from the scroll being passed to and from Ortho that he was a trader of some sorts. Who said he didn't have any salted nuts?* - Mon Oct 26 13:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) nodded her head a single time at that response - a vending machine... and thus Chi's head turned to the right and then to the left before looking over her left shoulder and then her right... all directions offered no visible vending machines and upon that discovery her vision returned to the male.

At that instance the hand holding the ryo got extended ever more out as if Chi wouldn't take no for an answer.

"Buy me some." Chi softly ordered only to speak out a mere second later as if to clarify on what she just said.. "And not sharing."* - Mon Oct 26 13:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) took the two bags in one hand - all was as it should be besides one of the three bags being in Ortho's grasp and so the free hand of Chi got positioned out and towards Ortho.

"Not there me go." Chi corrected as her gaze shifted down towards the remaining bag. She wanted her part of the deal fulfilled.* - Mon Oct 26 13:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) blinked not once but twice at the responce... was she just denied? A frown creeped on to her face as the hand she extended out towards got reeled in and stationed back at her side.

"... I trade two packets for one but you have to hand your nuts over first.... and then Chi hands you her nuts." Chi offered as she offered out her right hand again - her goal was to tempt the male with a great deal and once the his nuts were in her right hand she'd work from there.

Foolproof, right?* - Mon Oct 26 13:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) furrowed her brow and pouted slightly - this opponenet was smart, did he catch on to Chi's ploy?

Needless to say Chi's gaze followed the Ortho's nuts as they were passed from one hand to the next before finally stopping to be juggled in just one palm - the sheer sight of the nut's mistreatment forced some stress on this young girl's heart... evident by her fright at  each risky movement risking the nuts fall to gravity and eventually the ground - oh' how she hoped Ortho didn't drop them.

".... Chi will do anything for your salty nuts." Chi finally spoke out after a few seconds. Did she accept defeat? Whichever was the outcome Chi aimed for those salty nuts to be in her right palm.* - Mon Oct 26 14:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) kept her gaze focused on Ortho and the packet of salted nuts, she paid for the nuts in his possesion... he was nothing less than a nut-heathen.

"... You can go train, I can watch over the nuts." Chi reassured as she heard fractions of what Ortho previously said to Violet.... obviously not knowing the full story she just took it as another chance at reclaiming her salted nuts.

* - Mon Oct 26 14:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: I should go train - Mon Oct 26 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) 's scowl grew deeper, the sheer fact the packet of salted nuts weren't in her possesion rustled her feather.

"... If you don't give my nuts back I'll spread rumors about how your business is corrupt." Chi finally said, she seemed quite fed up to the point threats came on to the table and whats worse than a buisness hurting rumor to a tradesman such as Ortho.* - Mon Oct 26 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: All you're after is girls, sigh. - Mon Oct 26 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) followed on after Ortho with no hesitation.Perhaps he was leading her off elsewhere to continue trade.* - Mon Oct 26 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) tilted her head forward and down without any delay before bringing it back up - nodding twice in rapid succession to prove a point that one nod of confirmation wasn't enough... two was.

"I did say anything, yes." Chi responded, she did offer that deal for the nuts previously... but why was that option brought up after it got declined - did it get declined?* - Mon Oct 26 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) blinked once, she was.... confused? However the confusion subsided as she offered the male a slow nod of her head - "... Okay." Chi said this as she readied herself on the spot... for obvious reasons she positioned her left hand at her side and her right hand to the fore-front of her kimono.

Why? She didn't want the stored nuts to fall out and thus she placed her left hand to secure them in place and as for her right hand she didn't want her kimono getting blown up by the wind as she would come down from the jump and welcome gravity.

With the preparations complete Chi aimed to bend her knees slightly only to extend them shortly after... pushing up and with the aid of her feet and ankles she'd become airborne for roughly a split second... it was a weak jump - was she even trying?

"Done, nuts."* - Mon Oct 26 16:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) watched on as the nuts were juggled and thrown into the air - it truly looked akin to a death scene for Chi as the nuts nearly plummetted to the ground.

Thankfully they were caught... but the words spoken afterwards seemed almost as menacing, "... I can't lose my clothing, you don't wear anything beneath a kimono." Chi said this in response to the request.* - Mon Oct 26 17:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Is that a 'no, I won't do it'? - Mon Oct 26 17:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) thinks: The choices. - Mon Oct 26 17:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) 's eyes trailed as the bag got lifted up into the air... how dare he.

"... Chi'll consider it, for how long?" Chi asked.* - Mon Oct 26 17:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) remained still as Ortho approach and blissed her ears with the sound of the packet of nuts opening - it looked like a sin in which Ortho was about to commit as he took out a single piece and... didn't eat it? Chi was confused to the point of confusion even as it was brought to her lips and in turn she attempted to bite it out of his finger's grasp.

".... " It was a good deal, although to what degree she had to accomodate Ortho to was still unclear to Chi - "And milk?" Chi suggested, if this was a permenant supply of nuts she ought' to try for her favourite drink as well.* - Mon Oct 26 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) accepted the extra offering only to chew down on it, "Chi'll agree to the deal." Chi replied after a second in thought - it was an ideal deal... free food, free drink... forever?

"What do you need Chi'ta accomodate?" Chi add-on.* - Mon Oct 26 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) the act of the salted nut being pressed into her lips accompanied by the whisper into her left ear resulted in Chi's pale complexion to gain a the faintest tint of red to cover her cheeks... was it that he was this close to her, was it the smell or was it the act of being fed salted nuts - she wasn't sure but it didn't really matter... her chest just pounded and even quicker as the front of her kimono got tugged, "...Chi guesses." Chi muttered out under her breath as her hands moved up to meet at the center of her chest as to slowly undo the strap tying her kimono together and once it was undone she'd slide it away from her with one hand and let it fall to the ground.

With the strap gone that meant the Kimono slowly opened up to the outside world and each inch it opened up the more it revealed of Chi's pale skin. Although' before it opened and revealed too much she'd attempt to use her hand and criss-cross each side of the Kimono over one another in an attempt to shield her skin from the outside world... he asked her to take it off and the belt was enough, right?* - Mon Oct 26 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) eyed the pair of nuts in Ortho's hand and in response to it she'd drop her appengdages to reveal her pale white skin and other parts of her body like her growing breasts and erect nipples and hair-free somewhat glossed over groin.. was she turned on?

The cold wind blowing into her, more-so her nipples left Chi to shiver slightly.

"... How long does Chi have ta' do this?" Chi questioned, not really enjoying the cold.

* - Mon Oct 26 18:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) had her hand taken and by having it captive the bag in Ortho's possesion landed directly in her palm... the way Ortho looked at her body and the way he asked her for permission did indeed woo' the girl to the point of wanting to say 'yes' but her inital goal was reached, she just got the bag of salted nuts.

"You may but Chi is done now, Chi got 'er nuts." Chi attempted to say this, her body was saying yes and her mind was also saying yes - but her goal was completed. What will happen?* - Mon Oct 26 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) 's breathing was heavy to the point she dragged out her breaths - her body was turned on by the whole scenario to  the point it was obvious... "If Chi gives herself to you, will you take responsiability and give yourself to Chi?" Chi asked as her left hand slid forth and aimed to grasp at Ortho's groin - quite litterly taking the bull by the horns.* - Mon Oct 26 18:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) shivered at the touch to her breast and shivered once more in delight from the fondling of her erect nipple - she cursed herself to stay focused, she was in the midst of a conversation and her mind kept transversing to that of his groin, how good she was feeling and that this scenario was actually happening.

All the while she bit down at her lower lip, stifling a moan and once the coast was clear she'd speak - "I want you to teach me and each lesson I'll do one request for you." Chi said this with a faint smile creeping on her face, she was sure she meant 'any' request.

Needless to say Chi pushed herself back or aimed to - she wanted to focus on the conversation at hand and not get anymore horny.* - Mon Oct 26 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) || The time given to Chi was used well, she may seem socially lacking but she could read a situation and thus she reached down towards the ground to pick up the sash to her kimono before hastingly wrapping the left side over the right then following up with the sash - the end result being a clothed Chi but to the extent to have decency, her usual pristine kimono quality went down the drain as this one was lop-sided, the sash was inside-out.

Overall she looked like a quick-mess.

"... I prefer 'hands on' teaching." Chi remarked - it was a private joke.

All the while Chi's face was red and flustered, what on earth could of happend?* - Mon Oct 26 19:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) got gestured south and she would of gone without any resistance that is if her best friend didn't appear in the distance.

"... Mana! Chi'ere has someone she wants you to meet." Chi yelled out as he right hand lifted up from her side, signalling towards Ortho with a index finger pointing out.* - Mon Oct 26 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Who's that? - Mon Oct 26 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) glanced between Ortho and Mana as they both exchanged words - the blindlinly white smile presented by Mana got matched with the same smile; albeit the blinding variant of it.

Chi's ears perked up at the mention of training and her gazed instinctly focused on Mana,

And thus Chi's lips parted and her mouth opened, "Want to join?"* - Mon Oct 26 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Yaay!!! - Mon Oct 26 20:06:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Maybe we should train first and show later? - Mon Oct 26 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... I guess, we can take a bath later after trainin'. - Mon Oct 26 20:16:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: What now...? - Mon Oct 26 20:20:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) didn't waste any time in moving her hands up to her kimono before sliding her left hand in and taking out a pair of clear white undies and a sports-bra. With that Chi stepped behind Mana and proceeded to equip the panties up her legs and stealthingly equip the sports-bra through the means of loosening her kimono slightly.

Once both the sports bra and panties were safely secured she'd remove her kimono, folding it up and laying it square on the ground before standing back in her original spot.* - Mon Oct 26 20:31:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) leaned towards Mana in the hopes to embrace her in a hug, the end result would be Chi's hands wrapping around Mana's head as Chi essentially pulled her bestie into her bossom.

"Love ya' Mana." Chi openly said this before shifting her gaze to Ortho - "When will Chi n' Mana start?"* - Mon Oct 26 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) payed attention and focused on what mattered to herself and that was the Genjutsu side of the lesson. The instance Ortho began walking towards her and began slowly weaving the handsigns would be the moment Chi's focus intensified - her world consisted of herself and that of Ortho's hands as they contorted into various handsigns.

The first round of handsigns were met with observant eyes, the second string of handsigns were met with listening ears at the lecture and observant eyes once again but this time around her hands contorted slowly after Ortho - attempting to mimic the sequence as she had already memorized some aspects of it such as the obvious handsigns for the start of the sequence and for the end of the sequence.

By the time the third repetition came around she finished two sets and listened rather religiously to the lecture to the point she memorized key aspects of it such as the objective of the Genjutsu, the foundation of the Genjutsu being Clones mixed with Genjutsu and that the clones 'respawn' to a degree once destroyed. There were already a multitude of strategems that could go well with this technique.

- After the demonstration Chi's body got infiltraded by foreign chakra and by having done so the Genjutsu took affect. Various black figures began to protrude from the ground and as they stood up they began to take the shape and appearance of Ortho.

As quick as the Genjutsu got casted it would have got dispelled after Chi experienced the fact the clones respawned and multiplied to the point of never-endering Ortho's. At that instance Chi got a pretty good grip on the technique.

"... I'll attempt it now Chi'uess." Chi proclaimed outloud as she moved her left and right hand up to the center of her chest and upon contact with one another they contorted into the various handsigns. Chi got the first one right, the middle one wrong and the last one right and held it on the last handsign before ineffectivly executing a jutsu that didn't do anything but waste time and the smallest bit of chakra.

At that moment Chi broke her hands off from one another only to close her eyes - she relived her memories of the sequence she saw three times... she didn't focus on the first or last handsign but the ones inbetween the two. It took the girl a few seconds before opening her eyes.

Right when her eyes opened Chi moved her left and right hands back to the center of her chest before contorting the sequence of handsigns in a slow but accurate manner before holding it on the last handsign and pushing her chakra outwards and towards Ortho - aiming to put him under the Genjutsu if he so allowed it. She had no one else to practice on and thus' if succesful a multitude of Chi's would appear for a mere second before crumbling to the ground and returning to nothingness as soon as she dispelled the jutsu.

- In truth it was hard to tell if you pulled a Genjutsu off or not, especially one as passive as this one and so her gaze remained on her Sensei.. "Did Chi do good?"

"... Wouldn't that great massage count as Taijutsu... physical contact?" Chi questioned.* - Mon Oct 26 21:37:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) blinked once at the fact someone was speaking towards her and another blink at the fact... Chi was called a 'Miss'. She didn't know what to make of it, was it a compliment or a sly insult? She was just thirteen after all.

Needless to say Chi's left hand moved into an opening to her kimono only to slide in and out in a matter of seconds as she pulled out an object of salty proportions - a single salted nut.

"... Pardon?" Chi replied, not really all that sure as to what to say... regardless the nut lodged in-between her index finger and thumb got flicked up and into the air with its destination being her mouth. If its journey was successful it'd land square on Chi's tongue before being promptly chewed at and swallowed.* - Tue Oct 27 06:43:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) tilted her head forward and down only to bring it backwards and up - doing this twice slowly, offering the girl two faint nods as she spoke her name and about.. scrolls?

"... I don't have any scrolls, sorry." Chi said this while her left hand moved into her kimono only to take out a back of salted nuts; albeit the plastic bag was half empty.

"Chi can give you her nuts." Chi added on.* - Tue Oct 27 06:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) placed the plastic bag containing salted nuts back into the slit of her kimono - storing it away.

And thus Daisuke asked the question of the century and in turn Chi switched her gaze from Marrisa and to Daisuke, "Chi's salty nuts are not on sale anymore."* - Tue Oct 27 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Heiwa? - Tue Oct 27 07:14:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) blinked not once, not twice but three times... did he want nuts or not? And did he just insult her? One thing for sure Chi gained one thing out of this conversation and that was confusion.

"... Pardon?"* - Tue Oct 27 07:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) aimed to take the slightest step back all in the hopes of gaining some remote distance between her hair and Daisuke's hand.

"... I don't understand what you want but Chi's heart is taken." Chi admitted as her gaze shifted to the right slightly - what an intense fight.. not that she could get the gist of it but one thing she understod from sword fights is that bystanders  stationed themselves a good distance away.* - Tue Oct 27 07:20:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) creeped up on Ortho - or so she attempted, regardless the end goal was to position herself off the male's side and poke at his upper-body to gain his attention.

Will it work? Who knows.* - Tue Oct 27 07:28:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) transitioned her left hand into her kimono only to bring out the half-empty plastic bag of salted nuts. "Not good, I need some more nuts." Chi replied as she moved her right hand forth only to point towards the bag, she was running low.

"... An' how are you doin, Ortho?"* - Tue Oct 27 07:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) stored the cash away into her kimono, "Want Chi'ta help in scroll huntin'?" Chi asked as she manuvered to the side of Ortho.* - Tue Oct 27 07:50:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) bared her pearly white canines as she offered Ortho slowly growing smile, "So that' means you're free for awhile, want to go 'train'?" Chi asked as she took a step forward from her position at his side in the hopes of re positioning herself to his front, all-the-while turning to face him as she stared up at him with her silver irises.* - Tue Oct 27 07:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) reached a hand up to the nape of her own neck, softly scratching at it - "I think its good enough, what do you think?" Chi questioned as her gaze shifted from Ortho and towards the grass between them.

Chi looked like she was hiding something - evident by the scratching of her nape.* - Tue Oct 27 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) removed her hand from her nape only to return her gaze shyly back up - focusing solely into Ortho's eyes.

Chi's expression right now was that of a frown and her cheeks gained a slight tint of red - it was obvious that she was indeed embarrassed.. but about what?

"Uh... I like it when pain is inflicted on me and I'm... loud... and roughness." Chi eventually said this and in doing so the tint of red covering her cheeks intensified... the embarrassing thing was that she didn't know how to inform Ortho that she enjoyed pain.* - Tue Oct 27 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) || The moment Ortho signalled Chi forward she'd take a small step forth - one leg at a time as she motioned to close the distance between herself and the black haired male. All the while her hands moved up and down her Kimono, pulling and tugging at the fabric as Chi began to undress. The first piece off was the sash followed by her reaching down to pull at the laces of her shoes before promptly kicking them off to bare her naked feet. With that Chi's hands returned to her chest - completely sliding the Kimono off of her body and having it fall to the ground with the aid of gravity.

All that was left was her sports bra clinging to the outline of her breasts with the little nips poking through the black fabric and a pair of white panties with an obvious small wet-patch... it was obvious she was turned on.

"I want them ripped off me." Chi requested as her left hand moved up and into her sports bra while her other hand slide into her panties - all the while keeping her silver irises fixated and locked into Ortho's eyes. She kept her hands fondling for a mere second before sliding them out the moment she stood directly in front of Ortho.* - Tue Oct 27 08:40:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) caught the change of clothes in her hands, allowing it to drape over her hands.

"I see... so no physical contact?" Chi asked, normally she just got right into it - but this scenario was slow.

Needless to say Chi aimed to collected the scrolls.* - Tue Oct 27 11:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Are you all engaging in a stare down? - Wed Oct 28 08:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) is currently staring at Heiwa as her left hand moved into her kimono only to pull out a single salted nut in which she flicked up and into her mouth.

With the nut in her mouth she'd promptly grind it down, "No."* - Wed Oct 28 08:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) turned around to have her gaze shift upon Marco - "... Want ta' go on a date?" Chi asked as soon as her lips parted to showcase her pearly whire canines.

As soon as her mouth closed the young girl's lips began to curl at the sides and into a faint smile as she beamed her silver irises into Marco's eyes.

The reason she asked for a date was to find out more about these events and thing such as... the 'Resurrection'.* - Wed Oct 28 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) nodded her head once at the response, "Dinner date, please~!" Chi spoke out in a soft voice; she had to clarify the offer.* - Wed Oct 28 10:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) turned on her heel the moment Marco gestured her to walk ahead and Chi did just that, not wasting a moment as she entered a brisk walk.* - Wed Oct 28 10:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) glanced to the side as her silver irises fixated themselves on Ortho for a few seconds - analyzing the scenario. His eyes were closed and he was also awake. Upon this discovery a faint smile found itself forming on her face as she pushed her back off from the stone surface of the pole and forward from the wall.

Slyly Chi's hands moved into the pockets of her pink shorts, both sliding in only to slide out an instance later with ammo; two nuts.. one each hand. The moment her hands were armed she'd turn around to face Ortho with both her hands moving up to raise above her shoulders and bend back at the elbow as she winded her appendages akin to a catapult with a single nut placed in the bowl of her palm.

Without much time wasted Chi's arms extended outwards essentially flinging the nuts forth and in Ortho's direction. Will they hit? * - Wed Oct 28 14:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) fist-bumped the air with her left hand the moment the nuts hit their mark - the silent celebration was short lived with it ending the moment Ortho spoke out towards her... slowly but surely her hand lowered back to her side and her gaze shifted off to the side, almost as if she was attempting to feint innocence.

"... Don't know what you're talking about, Ortho." Chi muttered out only to purse her lips and produce the faintest of whistles.* - Wed Oct 28 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) 's whistling started to die down the moment Ortho closed his eyes - a single hand moved slowly into its respective pants pocket as it aimed to withdraw a single salted nut.

If all was succesful Chi aimed to position her hand up and over her shoulder before flexing it back and then propelling it forth with the nut placed in the bowl of her palm; essentially flinging it forth and towards Ortho as if her arm was a catapult.

Will it land? Needless to say the moment it exited her hand Chi's lips pursed once again into a whisper and her gaze shifted to the side.. once more feinting innocence to the act she just commited.* - Wed Oct 28 15:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: She really loves her nuts - Wed Oct 28 15:25:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I'm convinced Violet is bi-polar.. - Wed Oct 28 15:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) slowly manuvered her left hand into its respective pocket only to leave it in there, sheathed - mainly to have it easily armed when she found it convenient.

She aimed to follow in after Ortho to torment him with her nuts even inside the academy but currently her gaze just shifted from Ortho and and Violet.

"... If you'll excuse me." Chi muttered out as she aimed to enter the Academy. She didn't feel it right to stay around two people arguing.* - Wed Oct 28 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Oi. - Wed Oct 28 16:07:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hello, Chi. - Wed Oct 28 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) blinked once in Mana's direction before tilting her head to the left slightly only to blink once more with her gaze directed towards Ortho, "I'm 'ere and..." Chi cut herself off to raise her left hand from beneath the table she found herself at - quite simply waving a low wave to fill in the 'Hello'.* - Wed Oct 28 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) didn't even waste a second before parting her lips to speak, she knew whole heartedly what she was interested in as a profession and as a person... Genjutsu just intrigued her, it was one of the more freeing genre of Jutsu that seemed near boundless depending on its user.

And so.. Chi spoke out a few words in rapid succesion - "Genjutsu, that's all." Chi finished with a faint nod of her head.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Damn, Genjutsu. - Wed Oct 28 23:52:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) 's left hand moved into its respective pants pocket only to bring out a small notepad which had its cover colored pink - her other hand did the same but instead of a note pad it'd bring out a pink pencil with various flowery shapes here and there spanning the entirety of the pen.

The moment Chi brought out her tools she's lower herself down towards the ground and sit cross legged with her right hand holding the notepad flat on her right outer thigh and her left hand holding the pen to the first page of the notepad.

And thus' the note taking begun - the top of the page held the title and the title was appropriately named 'Fire Thing' and below it a vast empty space. All Chi did was hold the tip of the pen to the paper awaiting for the description of the Jutsu in which she quickly wrote down word by word as Ortho spoke it. It was a one two combo, her ears heard the words and her brain, fingers and eyes did the rest of the work writing it down... it essentially made it easier to remember.

The instance Ortho began to go through the hand signs Chi would scale down the page a few lines only to focus her sight on the hands of the male as he slowly demonstrated them - all the while writing down the name of the hand sign performed without proper vision on the page.. sadly making most the words become diagonal and poor - but at the end of the day it was her notes, oh how she hoped she could understand her own notes.

The following hand signs were written down in a zigzag-esc manner, 'Tiger > Ram > Monkey > Boar > Horse > Tiger'... with Tiger being the one to stand out the most, it made her question why there were two of the same hand signs in one sequence.

Needless to say once Chi managed to write down the required notes she'd quite easily forget about the note pad and focus entirely on Ortho as he began to demonstrate the final stages of the technique - producing an awe inspiring ball of flame, the pain on her eyes as she focused into it forced a smile of bliss to creep up and on her face.. oh how she liked pain.

The moment the demonstration ended and the large fireball dissipated she'd raise her left hand to her eyes, rubbing at the left eye first with the back of her hand before moving to rub at her right eye - she had to get rid of the faint blinding affect of looking into a heat-source for a long duration... not that she minded it, she just had to read her notes and right now her notes were quite blurry.

It took the young girl a few moments of rubbing before it clicked, her eyes were dry and thus' a water bottle was produced and the water promptly poured into her open eyes, flushing them out. Chi took a mental note not to stare into heat sources just before she had to read or fight, it was quite crippling.

Once her eyesight was returned to its full glory spare the faintest feeling of pain she'd store away the water bottle and stand up, leaving her note pad on the ground, "... Tiger, Ram, Monkey, Boar, Horse and Tiger." Chi muttered out as her hands moved in sync with the signs she spoke only to stop at the last sign with her hands contorted and held in the tiger sign.

Chi's back arched as she prepared for the Jutsu; albeit her stomach didn't well outwards like it was meant to - and thus when she straightened her back and pushed forward only to purse her lips and breath out... nothing. It was a failure. Awkwardly Chi broke her hands off from one another and her gaze drifted down towards her notes, where did she go wrong? It was quite embarrassing to just exhale air for a good few seconds thinking you were shooting off a jutsu.

A quick revision and re-read of her notes showcased the issue, she forgot to knead the chakra beforehand... or at all - and thus' the young girl's hands moved together only to center just above her bellybutton, the first sign Chi produced was that of the tiger sign as she held it to focus and knead chakra in her stomach. A solid few seconds passed for Chi to knead the chakra and once she kneaded some chakra she'd continue with the sequence of hand signs, doing the following in a slow but accurate manner - useless in combat but great for this occasion, learning.

Ram, Money, Boar, Horse and finally tiger, with that Chi finished the sequence only to arch her back and focus the chakra she kneaded - her stomach swelled a mere fraction of what Ortho's did but nonetheless it still swelled as Chi prepared herself, her lips pursed and her head tilted back - all that was left was to straighten her back and push forward and promptly breath outwards; expelling the fire in her stomach to her front.

The fireball's size was laughable at most and the duration was even more laughable as it got expelled in a stream for a solid two seconds before cutting off and leaving Chi near breathless.

However tired she may have seemed got quickly washed over by the excitement of... performing a fire jutsu - evident by her eyes lighting up and a smile showcasing itself on her face, "... Done." Was all Chi muttered out... when did the huge crowd get here? She must've been too wrapped up in trying to perform the jutsu.* - Thu Oct 29 01:23:37 2015

Needless to say Chi's free hand moved to her front as it formed a fist with its thumb poking out; essentially shooting Mana a thumbs up.

"You got this Mana!" Chi yelled out only to drop her hand as soon as the message of encouragement reached. All the while Chi's gaze shifted towards Ortho, "What did you want to talk about, before?"

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right, right. I remember you liked pain, aha. - Thu Oct 29 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Correction, I love pain. - Thu Oct 29 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright, alright. - Thu Oct 29 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You 'looove' pain. - Thu Oct 29 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) gained a faint smile at that remark, "... Oh?"* - Thu Oct 29 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhmm. It's.. unique. - Thu Oct 29 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: How so...? - Thu Oct 29 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because, you're original. - Thu Oct 29 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: How many people can you say love pain? - Thu Oct 29 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That just opens a door for.. you know.. - Thu Oct 29 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: A lot more fun. - Thu Oct 29 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Haha, yeah... don't know much who like pain. - Thu Oct 29 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: And what type of fun? - Thu Oct 29 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Well.. I mean - Thu Oct 29 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: We could continue what we startd the other day, but I know your training is important. - Thu Oct 29 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) cracked a faint smile, it was part lustful and part innocent.

"... I'm the type of girl who doesn't have her priorities straight... what's more important, training or.." Chi paused with her left and right hand moving to her front - her left hand formed a circle with her index and thumb finger while her right hand had her index finger extended out.

In one motion Chi quite simply slid the index finger through the hole, in and out.. all the while her gaze remained on Ortho.* - Thu Oct 29 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) shook her head one, a faint shade of red covered her cheeks as she parted her lips.. "Finger... or?" Chi asked as her hands re-enacted the movements once again.* - Thu Oct 29 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That one. - Thu Oct 29 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Oh... - Thu Oct 29 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: I haven't, not yet. - Thu Oct 29 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Ohh, okay then. - Thu Oct 29 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... Huh? - Thu Oct 29 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: N-Nothing.. - Thu Oct 29 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Umm. - Thu Oct 29 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I talked to Mana about.. what she and I did. - Thu Oct 29 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I gave her that massage. - Thu Oct 29 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I think she regrets it, I don't know. - Thu Oct 29 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... - Thu Oct 29 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: So... the thing you and I did, you also did with Mana? - Thu Oct 29 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I mean.. yeah. You suggested it to her and she asked about it.. - Thu Oct 29 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I thought you wanted me to give it to her.. - Thu Oct 29 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I was less.. in to it.. - Thu Oct 29 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Than I was with you though.. - Thu Oct 29 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Not saying she's not attractive.. but you were on my mind.. - Thu Oct 29 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: O-Oh... really? While you were... going into her? - Thu Oct 29 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..No, no.. I didn't go into her. - Thu Oct 29 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I only used my hands.. - Thu Oct 29 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And kept my fingers out of her.. you know.. - Thu Oct 29 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Oh... you're not confident in your... D? - Thu Oct 29 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not ashamed of it, but I was more or less.. waiting on you. - Thu Oct 29 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... For wha-... oh. - Thu Oct 29 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: You want me to... my hand, your D? - Thu Oct 29 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I've thought about it.. - Thu Oct 29 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And more.. - Thu Oct 29 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But I didn't want to bring it up and make you feel like you 'had' to. - Thu Oct 29 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Oh... as long as you're rough... then I'm fine with anythin'. - Thu Oct 29 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: No pain... no gain. - Thu Oct 29 06:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Uhh.. - Thu Oct 29 06:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... O-Oh.. did I say too much? - Thu Oct 29 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No, no. You didn't. - Thu Oct 29 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Just.. temptations.. - Thu Oct 29 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... To do what? - Thu Oct 29 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Stuff. Here.. - Thu Oct 29 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Right now.. - Thu Oct 29 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... What's stoppin' you? - Thu Oct 29 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You not being over here. - Thu Oct 29 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... Coming over here? I thought this was a business talk? - Thu Oct 29 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I thought we ended the business talk at the other house. - Thu Oct 29 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: Oh... I see. - Thu Oct 29 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) moved her left hand up to her chest only to slide it beneath the left part of her bra - cupping her left breast.

"So... Mister Ortho, what is this meeting about?" Chi asked as she slid her left hand out from beneath her black bra.* - Thu Oct 29 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) eyed the confined member as she bit her lower lip, "... I'm not touching that without me..." Chi paused as she got up from the pillow and with a wag of her butt in Ortho's direction she'd move one leg forward - aiming to walk north slowly and past the pillow.

"... Forcin' me." Chi continued - what did she want from Ortho?* - Thu Oct 29 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) got stopped in her tracks and pulled back by her hair - the pain sent shivers down her spine and an odd smile to form on her face.

One second she had her sight focused on the floor in front of her to walk forward and the next second she had her gaze forced into Ortho's crotch... her lips pressed against the hot tip only to open up and embrace the cock into her mouth - Chi went leaps and bounds beyond the norm' as she bobbed her head up and down, taking his cock in deeper each time - eventually to the point her lips kissed the base of his cock... deep throating Ortho as her tongue glided up and down his glands.

All the while Chi's left hand slid into her bra, fondling at her breasts and her other hand reached down in the hopes of cupping Ortho's balls.* - Thu Oct 29 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) felt her bra become ripped off, a moan escaped her lips as the pain on her nipples rushed throughout her body, it hurt... it hurt so good - with Ortho swaying his hips back and forth Chi would match it... so when he thrusted forth she'd bounce her head into his thrust; essentially pushing his cock even deeper into her throat.

She almost had the sensation to gag as she took it all into her mouth.* - Thu Oct 29 07:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) found herself robbed of Ortho's cock as he pulled it out her mouth and forced her around to the point she fell forward with her hands and face pressed into the ground and her ass hung out into the air... it was so quick - she felt something enter her pussy but only for a shot distance; was it his tip? She wasn't sure - she just knew it was something large and it was something good and so her walls collasped around the tip... akin to suction cups and quick sand.

"Un.. " Chi panted out softly as she tilted her head to the side as to look back at Ortho, "D-don't cum ins-.." It was at that instance the first thrust was produced, Chi's speech got interupted by a gasp of air and moans... blood began to trickle onto Ortho's member and pain forced Chi to grit her teeth; thankfully the shock-pain of having her hymen broken lasted for a mere second and soon it turned into painful pleasure as she felt tighter than ever before.* - Thu Oct 29 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) tightened up each time his hand made contact with her cheek, the slap resonated with a moan - her tightness also synced with how hard he pulled her hair... the pain was pleasure for Chi as her tongue lol'd out to the side and her mouth gaped open in blissful moans... with each thrust into her she'd press back into him - but as the thrusts continued her power lessened, her legs were giving way and she was in Shinobi Heaven.* - Thu Oct 29 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) shuddered each time he thrusted into her, producing mini-orgasms as pleasure flooded her body, it wasn't until he gained extra leverage by gripping her sides and pushing her closer to the ground as he pumped downwards and into her.

The way she twitched and the way her pussy reacted to each thrust was an obvious sign she was about to orgasm for real.* - Thu Oct 29 08:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) had their positions change, the forcefulness of Ortho increased the sexiness of the scenario - well in Chi's mind as she got man-handled with her face facing down into the table... one thrust, two thrust... each met with a more intense shake of her body til' it tightened completely on the thirst thrust.

Chi's toes curled inwards and her legs spasmed out accompanied by her body moving akin to a bolt of lightning... she was having a rather intense orgasm and to top it off clear liquid neither urine nor water but a mix of the both began to shoot out from her vagina; she was squirting.

It was evident by her facial features that she was in absolute bliss as her eyes rolled back slightly and her mouth gaped open - a loud moan could be heard as she continued to squirt, it seemed never-ending.* - Thu Oct 29 08:51:37 2015
