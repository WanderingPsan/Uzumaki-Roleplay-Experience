<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) glanced to the side, Lanzi looked tired.

"... Want to play some truth and dare?" Chi asked, cracking a faint smile; she was also tired with visible bags below her eyes.* - Sat Oct 31 10:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Odd then, that you two are unfamiliar with one another. - Sat Oct 31 10:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) moved her right hand back and then to the side; aiming to slap Jirun's back with what little force she could muster, even if the slap landed or not she'd speak out - "What isn't dead can stand again, soldier on.. lil' boy."* - Sat Oct 31 10:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) retracted her hand, thankfully the little force meant little pain.

And thus her gaze shifted towards Kana, "Allo' Rated Miss Zero." Chi greeted Kana.* - Sat Oct 31 11:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... Huh? - Sat Oct 31 11:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: . . . . . - Sat Oct 31 11:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: You know... she went ballistic after that, and attacked one of the people in the bar right? - Sat Oct 31 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... Really? - Sat Oct 31 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Yes... and I was the one caught in the middle. - Sat Oct 31 11:07:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Train what? - Sat Oct 31 11:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... Ourselves? Train? - Sat Oct 31 11:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: The only thing I have to train is shunshin jutsu. That thing... gah... after last night might do me in. - Sat Oct 31 11:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) lanced left then to the right, surveying her surroundings for a good ten seconds before returning her focus to the body of water in front of her; a lake and she was there on standing over it with the aid of a jetty. 

Chi's left hand moved up to the collar of her shirt only to grip at the brim of it on one side while her other hand, her right hand did the same; albeit the other side and the instance her hands both gained a grip she'd pull up, carefully but eventually removed her short-sleeved shirt only to toss it to the side and have it fall spread out across one of the various wooden poles.

With that Chi repositioned her hands to the center of her chest, contorting her hands together and interlocking them just above her belly button. The first hand sign her hands contorted to was that of the Tiger hand sign as she held her hands in that sign. 

The moment Chi held the tiger sign she'd begin to mold and swell her chakra in her stomach, mixing it with her fire affinity - once a sufficient amount of chakra got stored for the jutsu she'd continue on with the sequence.

"... Then Ram.." Chi muttered out to remind herself, contorting her hands from the Tiger Hand Sign into the Ram Hand Sign and then the Monkey Hand Sign, Boar Hand Sign, Horse Hand Sign and then the Tiger Hand Sign.

The moment Chi finished the Hand Sign sequence she'd arch her back and tilt her head back before pursing her lips, "Fire Release: Goukakyou No Jutsu!" Chi would roar out as her body swelled and her back straightened only to breath out and release the contained chakra outwards in the form of a fireball; albeit small.

Chi channeled the Jutsu for a solid five seconds before closing her lips to cancel the jutsu, "... Done." Chi muttered to herself as she broke her hands off of one another. Sweat built up on her brow.* - Sat Oct 31 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) crossed her hands over her lap only to bow her upper body forward in one fluid motion - in the direction of the Mizukage whom was Savage.

"Good day, Lady Savage Kage." Chi greeted her superior only to finish the sentence and stand back up straight.

It was evident was either tired or... hungover, she had bad bags beneath her eyes.* - Sat Oct 31 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: .... - Sat Oct 31 14:44:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) thinks: It had the opposite effect of what I wanted to accomplish. - Sat Oct 31 14:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Yeah no more Sake for underaged people. - Sat Oct 31 14:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chi(Sapphiria) says: ... - Sat Oct 31 14:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: For safety reasons. - Sat Oct 31 14:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) instinctly moved onto her hind-leg, shifting her body in a way to bring her backpouch back and out of the Mizukage's view.

Was she hiding something?

"Yeah... no more Sake, that stuff isn't addictive n' tastes bad." Chi agreed with a nod, each time she moved the clicks of two glass bottles tapping against one another accompanied by the slushing of liquid could be heard.* - Sat Oct 31 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) reached her left hand back, uncliipping and pushing up the flap to her back pouch to reveal two small glass white bottles with the Kanji of 'Sake'.

"They're filled with water..." Chi said this as she took one of the bottles out of her pouch, offering it out for the Mizukage to smell or take, whichever.* - Sat Oct 31 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) || The bottle Kirie tested smelled liek water and tasted like water.

"So..?" Chi questioned, she wanted the results - oh how she hoped the Mizukage didn't check the 2nd bottle.

"I don't drink Sake." Chi added on with a faint smile.* - Sat Oct 31 15:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Very well. - Sat Oct 31 15:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) pushed herself up from the table only to take a step back and strip down; discarding her tanto, pants, shoes and then her undergarments... following that Chi unclipped her bra followed by her panties - placing all the articles carefully on the table.

"Alright.." Chi muttered out before raising her hands above her head and falling forward, doing a hand stand naked for a few seconds.

After a second or two Chi fell backwards... completing her 'dare'.

"Truth or dare?" Chi asked as she aimed to dress herself.* - Sun Nov  1 04:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chi(Sapphiria) took the robe, "Thank you... Dare." Chi said this as she aimed to wear the robe, which was over-sized for her.

With that Chi brought out a bottle of Orange Juice, taking a small sip of it.* - Sun Nov  1 05:06:46 2015
