She stripped off her clothes for the most part and entered the shower room. She desired to close the door behind her but that didn't seem possible. Nonetheless, Makoto begins to rinse herself, starting with her hair and going downwards. Her hands ran in between the cracks of her body and her cleavage. She made sure not to leave any spot; she was overly hygienic in a way and was passionate to keep her body clean as well as her strength up. * - Fri Oct 30 04:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) rose her eyebrows. She looks at the honey bun and the soda. She smiles as Lyan continued onwards with his speech. 

"Thank you for ... telling me that message." She said quietly. "I'm going to become really strong! People are going to admire me and stuff because of how strong I am!" She said ambitiously. She still had an accent and she avoided difficult words because she didn't know how to pronounce them.* - Fri Oct 30 05:41:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) grins. She pushes herself onto Bryson immediately with aggression, aiming to straddle his waist with both of her legs. Her hands would push him again the ground and try to tie him in a playful headlock.* - Fri Oct 30 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) use her strength to play with Bryson. "You're good! Not bad!" Makoto commented as he gripped onto her arm. Makoto bends her elbow slightly though and twists her forearm forwards whilst ontop of Bryson. Her right knee digs into Bryson's pelvic region and her thigh presses against his crotch. Her other leg wraps around his leg tightly and her left arm moves to presumptiously wrap around Bryson's other arm. Her right arm was still locking him in a hold.* - Fri Oct 30 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) grinned and laughed. "Man, this is pretty fun with you!" Makoto commented quickly, as she tightened her hold on him. The single hand that had gripped onto her breast had changed everything though. Makoto wasn't wearing a bra underneath her uniform so she was extremely embarrassed upon being touched there.

Makoto thus looks into Bryson's eyes with eyes that spelled death teasingly. "Where do you think you're touching?" Makoto questioned, with a stern look on her face for a moment. Her knee pushes into his pelvic region even further and she grits her teeth. "L-Let go of that area." Her grip on Bryson overall weakens.* - Fri Oct 30 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) had suddenly been pinned to the floor---a disgrace for a judo specialist like herself. She was suddenly nuzzled in the chest region, where her breasts were, yet again a region which wasn't covered properly. "W-What the heck are you doing?!" -She shouted. She wraps her legs around her waist and holds him down, her hands grabbing onto his shoulders. If done properly, Makoto would roll Bryson over to the side and she would then be ontop of him, pressing her buttocks against his pelvic region. "Just let me win!"

She had that bad habit of -really- wanting to win.* - Fri Oct 30 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) kept on holding him down with the brunt of her strength. She would grin down at him after the struggles were made in vain.

"I think I win, Bryson-san." Makoto grinned at him, leaning her face in closer to his, before backing out. She'd stand up from his body, having worked up a light sweat from the intimate workout.* - Fri Oct 30 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) blinks. She places a palm against her chest.

"Me? A massage for you?" Makoto grinned. "Are you sure?~" She questioned, able to speak English that was this simple, at least. She steps over behind him and starts to sit behind him. Her hands gripped onto his shoulders and press down tightly on his muscles. "Is this okay?"* - Fri Oct 30 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) smiles. She lightens her massage, understanding there was a difference in strength. 

"Bryson, I'm going to sleep in a moment..."

She tries to figure out the next word she wants to say, but settles on something else.

"I'll talk to you tomorrow."* - Fri Oct 30 07:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) avoids the lip kiss; she was too scared of such a thing. She allows the kiss to the forehead and she was simply blushing. "This is so girly... so uncool...." Makoto murmured, the tomboyish girl trying to get away from the lip contact. She sits down beside Bryson, resting on the fuuton. 

"Okay... thank you."* - Sat Oct 31 07:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) yawns herself. "Hai, hai." Makoto looks for a blanket.

Once she finds one, she wraps Lyan in the blanket.

"Good night, macho man..." Makoto murmured, as she headed to the bedroom.* - Sat Oct 31 07:16:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | Suddenly, Makoto entered the fray. Foreigner or not, she was interested in combatting an opponent of a higher caliber than her. Makoto enters the traditional stance of Judo by letting one of her hands freely roam without being clenched in front of her, at shoulder-level. Her other hand is at her waist and is also unclenched. Her feet are not shoulder-width apart but instead drive in home to the center of gravity she had.

She'd try and rally the attention of the opponent. Granted, she was targetting the person...

Who looked remarkably like a white-skinned Bojack.

"Come at me!" She shouted promptingly and provokingly.* - Sun Nov  1 05:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: That's probably the fun of it. - Sun Nov  1 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | As such, Makoto prepares herself. The opponent in question had closed the distance between them; this only serves to help Makoto gap-close for her incoming technique. She inhales deeply, preparing herself as she fills her alveoli with plenty of air for the next engagement. She has no idea how durable this opponent is; however, the goal ultimately was to test the durability of her opponent and to see how she stood.

She would unleash her ultimate technique immediately as soon as she had entered. 

"Gate of Opening - Kai." She bites her lip. Her muscles tear and her muscles are exponentially powered up in order to support her next transition.

"Gate of Healing - Kai." She smiles lightly, healing the torn muscles. She revitalizes herself and closes in on her opponent.

Her right fist lunges for the opponent's pelvic region.

Yes, she was targeting his penis. She'd smash her fist right into his crotch and perhaps cause a sphincter of pain to spiral up his spinal cord and throughout his peripherals in one immediate instant, blowing past his assets. Her right fist and left fist start to unleash a combo upon the torso of the muscular man afterwards.

In conclusion, her right fist spikes up like a pinnacle of sensation, trying to pummel the target's chin and rocket them airborne. * - Sun Nov  1 05:52:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | She was forced back from the situation. She rolls along the ground and skids back, deactivating her Gates as a result. Makoto had done her deal and was surprised by how little effect her combination seemed to have on the male, where any typical man would've been knocked out. She lands on the ground, only to realize an anarchist-archetype of chaos was ensuing with the prisoners breaking out. She glances at Bryson and runs to his side, afraid for his safety and trying to preserve the priest's life incase.* - Sun Nov  1 07:01:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) was not about to be uprooted from her position so easily. She wasn't able to counter Paine that well. However, when her blow came in, Makoto's right and left arms moved in a shield-like fashion to block the strike, mitigating its effect should it have been a direct blow. Makoto roots herself to the ground though, eager to not be blown up into the air.

A crouched Paine. A perfect position. 

"Gate of Opening." Makoto muttered to herself. Suddenly, her strength amplified as she opened the Gate. Her strength was used to swing at Paine while she was trying to kick at Makoto, a powerful blow that swung like a hook. Her left forearm pressed its elbow into her stomach as to protect herself. The olceranon attaches itself to her umbilicus and the forearm wavers around like a protective, defensive measure. * - Wed Nov 11 22:31:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) had suddenly been struck against her hook. Makoto blinked: Paine didn't even budge an inch from her attack. Makoto is then blown backwards by the kick, finding herself airborne.

However, before Makoto could get airborne, her feet moved backwards; it results in her leaping backwards from the upwards vector of Paine's strike in accompaniment with her backwards jump. Because Makoto had refused to be airborne, perhaps the next kick would not come after her. Makoto backs off momentarily.

"She's really.... really..... really strong!" Makoto grins to herself. 

For some reason, Paine kept on trying to beckon her into mid-air. It was a sign to Makoto really, that Paine preferred mid-air combat. Makoto though, desperately clung to the ground as a 'landlubber'.

If she countered Makoto's next move of course, Makoto would have a problem. 

"Gate of Healing!" She dashes forward. Unlocking the Gate of Healing, Makoto now unleashes her ultimate technique. If Paine had gotten to a standing position, since their positions were changed and Makoto was no longer directly above her, Makoto would dash at Paine.

Her right hand attempts to smash into Paine's crotch region. If it struck, his hands would blur to try and strike her multiple times in the chest. 

This was her combo: it was trying to counter Paine's combo.

"Seichusen, Godanzuki!"

If all of the hits struck core, Makoto's right hand would uppercut Paine.* - Wed Nov 11 22:56:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) had somehow managed to strike into Paine. However, Paine had recuperated relatively qucikly from Makoto's attack. Makoto rose her left hand to block the kicks, but is knocked back relatively far due to the impediment of four kicks. Two final spinning kicks strike her though, resulting in Makoto being tossed to the side. Makoto rolls along the ground with a heavy loss of breath. Remaining on the ground, she simply inhales deeply and exhales even more harshly. 

"G-Guh... Y-Yes, let's keep going."

There were visible bruises on Makoto's person at this point. Getting hit by Paine's kicks were already pretty harmful. And Paine had just pulled off a Kenshin move, which Makoto's never seen in her life. The speed of those kicks made it nearly impossible for her to counter. 

When Paine activated her mode, Makoto prepares herself for close-combat. * - Wed Nov 11 23:33:32 2015
