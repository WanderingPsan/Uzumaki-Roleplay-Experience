<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | Eventually, Makoto finds herself settling down in the location. She figures that two of the ninja over yonder were sparring or doing some other friendly training exercise to bolster one another's abilities & foundation. Therefore, Makoto decided to do similar by herself. She swings at the air with a sharp precision-based karate chop. 

Afterwards, she brings herself into a traditional & orthodox martial arts stance: the Horse Stance. It involved placing the legs shoulder-width apart and placing the arms by one's sides, while maintaining them at ninety degree angles. She swings her fists forward, without uttering a word. After all, she did not wish to disturb the populace. * - Fri Oct 23 01:38:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) proceeds to continue her training regiment. After roughly thirty reps of ten punches, Makoto bends her arms at ninety degree angles before quite literally flattening herself on the ground. With her arms more close to her waist than they were to herhead, she begins to execute push-ups to the point where her chest was to touch the ground. 

It just didn't feel good if she didn't make it to the bottom after all. It was all about execution. It was all about performing it to the best of one's ability and performing a push-up correctly. * - Fri Oct 23 01:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: They don't train and they speak to each other. - Fri Oct 23 01:44:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) begins to pace shortly over to Sanoke and Mirai. When she does arrive at their position though, she awkwardly stands there, before walking away, probably because she had no idea what to say and had rashly gone up to them without contemplating beforehand.* - Fri Oct 23 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: I don't even understand what they're saying, I shouldn't interfere with whatever they're talking about. - Fri Oct 23 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) looks at Sanoke and is suddenly flustered.

"Ah, eto, eto..."

Makoto was trying to figure out what to say, and instead spurts something out in a foreign language.

"Anata wa nanio hanashite shimashita?"* - Fri Oct 23 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | Her face imitates the complexion of a tomato afterwards. She realizes that she had just spoken in her native language and not the proper language. She takes a deep breath, inhaling before she speaks this time as if it was a calming ritual.

"I.... speek. . . . litto." She makes a hand gesture to indicate 'so-so'.* - Fri Oct 23 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: I should never have spoken. - Fri Oct 23 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: It's given rise to such a conflicting situation. - Fri Oct 23 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: I've no clue how to speak his language. Did I say the words right? - Fri Oct 23 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) thinks: Maybe my accent was just too heavy...?! - Fri Oct 23 01:54:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | Quietly, she shifts her weight on her feet. Ever so nervously, Makoto adjusts the application of her weight on either foot repetitively, exchanging the weight whenever she felt a string of anxious butterflies streaming through her stomach. Encountering new people and communicating with them in a foreign language was, well, foreign to her.

She strides over to Sanoke, her facial expression switching into that of anticipation and prudence. 

"Y-Yes." That was probably one of the words she had mastered the most. For obvious reason.* - Fri Oct 23 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Damn. - Fri Oct 23 02:05:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) glances at the handshake. She, who had never received a handshake before in her life, has no idea what to do with it. She just stands there idly, staring blankly at the hand gesture without the slightest recognition of the gesture's proverbial meaning. Her culture was foreign and so were the traditions that she was exposed to. In her country, bowing was the traditional way of greeting another person; thus, the handshake is foregone and she ignores it.

"Boku no namae wa----.. . . Eto... Um..."

She just saids her name.

"Makoto."* - Fri Oct 23 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) looks at Sanoke unsurely. Her gaze drifts apart from Sanoke's eyes for a moment. She wasn't able to respond to this question, due to a group of complex words now making their way into the fray. Asking for one's name was easy. She could recognize 'name'; it was essential to survival. However, she had no idea what Sanoke was saying now.

"...Um..."* - Fri Oct 23 02:18:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) || Makoto was trying her best to recognize Sanoke's diction but was having difficulty doing so because it was not phrased in her native tongue. Unlike a dialect in her native tongue, she couldn't understand it even a bit. Because of Sanoke's animated sequence, Makoto could hear each syllable much more effectively; she begins to analyze them rapidly with phonetic principle to no avail.

Suddenly, Sanoke phrased the question in a different way: a kinesthetic fashion.

Her eyes linger on the four clones, that were Henge'd as her. Makoto observes the Sunagakure garbs and the suitcases. She guessed that meant traveling?

Then, the marching fashion gave it away. It was .... traveling?

As the doppelgangers are dispersed, her eyes linger on the question mark.

She has no clue what a queston mark is though. 

She figures she asked him how she traveled, so she points at her bare feet.* - Fri Oct 23 02:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) looks at the hands that were flying through the air. 

Makoto thus decides that Sanoke was looking for a spar. Makoto's hands raise, pumping against one another once they were clenched. Her cheeky smile sprouts at this point and her head nods vigorously in agreement with the gesture that Makoto interpreted from Sanoke.

"Yes." She responds.* - Fri Oct 23 02:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | Quickly, her right arm moves forward. It was her dominant arm and that was to be expected of a judo user. Her right arm aims to grapple hold of Sanoke by the side of his armpit, while her left hand eagerly reaches for his tricep, just as the hand is to touched her shoulder. 

She ducks inwards into Sanoke's form, bending her own stature downwards by crouching. She tilts herself to the side into Sanoke's body, to try and place Sanoke's chest squarely on her shoulders. She'd try to lift him upwards if that were the case, in the traditional Kata Guruma motion.

"Kata Guruma." She shouts, the first time she ever decided to shout. She'd just hold onto Sanoke, though she does begin a dropping motion to the side.* - Fri Oct 23 02:37:52 2015

That was something -she- wanted to do! She scurries on over to Izutora in an effort to mimic or imitate him. She replicates his actions by raising herself on her hands. Her palms dig into the sand as she tries to follow behind Izutora's motions.

However, she doesn't make any effort to get next to Izutora or anything, she just wants to imitate what he was doing since she judged him as a senpai in Taijutsu.* - Fri Oct 23 03:10:17 2015

Makoto continues to trudge onwards, using the muscles built in her arms to carry herself upright and erect. She keeps on following Izutora; unlike him though, she is shown to be struggling with the exercise as she didn't do it on a daily basis or anything.

She lacked that well-toned frame that he had, but she at least had the energy and the courage to keep on working at it. She paces forward.

Unfortunately, her elbows are bending and it looks like she's about to give on the exercise. Instead, she pushes herself over her limits and forwards herself without resting her body.* - Fri Oct 23 03:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) would nod, but she was not in an applicable position to do so. It would've been strenuous to have nodded while in such an awkward stature. Instead, she replies with a stern and confident 'yes'. She re-energizes herself, pushing up with additional vigor in her bicep and tricep muscles. She could feel the collagen fibers literally stretching themselves adversely in the hand of elastin, which coupled together to maintain limber stretching movements of her arms as she changed position.

When his right arm was extended, Makoto didn't have any time to react. She finds herself gripped by the arms and readjusted. 

She could vaguely understand what he was saying, but she can relatively pick up on conceptual cues for his intentions.* - Fri Oct 23 03:47:50 2015
