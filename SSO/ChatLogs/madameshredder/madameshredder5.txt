<br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Name anything you want if you win. - Thu Nov 12 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Anything I want? - Thu Nov 12 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: ..... - Thu Nov 12 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: There's nothing I want... - Thu Nov 12 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: . . . . . - Thu Nov 12 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: A conversation. - Thu Nov 12 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Sure. - Thu Nov 12 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: I'd like you to teach me what you can do in Taijutsu if I win. - Thu Nov 12 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: You can take the first move. - Thu Nov 12 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) swiftly reacts. She moves forwards towards Ichiro, trying to quite literally burrow her head into his side. She'd duck underneath his punch, trying to place her cheek against his side. Her right arm tries to grab hold of the attacking arm's tricep and yank Ichiro's body over her shoulders. She'd try to bring him into a fireman's carry and fling her down to the ground if possible.* - Thu Nov 12 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) is fazed by the fact that Ichiro was not affected by her throw. Nonetheless, Makoto is determined to do damage to her opponent. "That might not have worked. What about this?" She shouted. She steps in towards Ichiro before twisting her body backwards so that her back presses into his chest. Her right arm tries to grapple hold of his right arm's shoulder. With a fierce swing of her hipbone, she'd try to toss Ichiro back onto the ground. * - Thu Nov 12 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) is kicked right in the leg. Makoto backs off afterwards, having stood her ground and somehow not fallen from the brunt of the blow. Makoto takes another step back, readjusting her posture in preparation for Ichiro to stand back up. Luckily, the blow wasn't strong enough to hurt her too badly. Makoto was akin to a brick wall in the same regard as Ichiro in this way.* - Thu Nov 12 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) noted the change in stance. Makoto blinks. Suddenly, the overhead punch came at her. She lifts up her left forearm to block the long-overhead punch. She drives inwards towards Ichiro, attempting to strike him with her shoulder and smash against his body so that perhaps he'd skid backwards from the initial brunt force of the attack. * - Thu Nov 12 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) brought both of her arms in tandem into a shield-like fashion to block the blow and mitigate its damage. Once more, she dashes at Ichiro, trying to build up damage by speed and close-combat. Her right hand tries to drive into Ichiro from above. His posture made him lean backwards a lot; the balance of his body was all the way on the back. Meaning, if she added pressure onto that side, she could force Ichiro into the ground. That is exactly what she was going to pull.

She'd smash Ichiro right into the ground with a hook, and follow through with an elbow to his pectoral. * - Thu Nov 12 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) straddled Ichiro as she victored. She was actually about to unleash a combo on his face, walloping it until he gave up.

Since he gave up early, there was no need to go to such measures.

"Yes! Victory!" Makoto grinned.* - Thu Nov 12 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: ...Mmm? - Thu Nov 12 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Thank you. - Thu Nov 12 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) gets off of him.* - Thu Nov 12 02:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's good to...actually face another Taijutsu user... - Thu Nov 12 02:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: I like sparring Taijutsu users. - Thu Nov 12 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: That's why I'm here. - Thu Nov 12 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: I'm looking for Amegakure's strongest Taijutsu users. - Thu Nov 12 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Ah... - Thu Nov 12 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Well, you fought their only one. - Thu Nov 12 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Ah! - Thu Nov 12 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Was that your 100% though? - Thu Nov 12 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) has a strong accent when she speaks.* - Thu Nov 12 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Yeah. I'm not really much more than a wall, you could say. - Thu Nov 12 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But, since you won, I'll have to keep up on my end of the bet. - Thu Nov 12 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Although...From what I saw, you're more experienced...and all I've really got to offer is my boxing stance. - Thu Nov 12 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Mmmmm. - Thu Nov 12 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: I'd still love to learn. - Thu Nov 12 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Alright. - Thu Nov 12 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) nods. She imitates Ichiro for a moment. She stretches her limbs out like a sloth, with both of her arms hanging low to the body. She bends her knees as she sees Ichiro doing the same; she mimics his body to a fit in terms of posture; the only question remained was whether or not she could perform in it.* - Thu Nov 12 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) quietly nods. "Okay. So you counter attacks using this stance?" She blinks.

She -tries- to sway the body, granted, she's never done something like this before. Naturally, it is awkward because she is an amateur at this.

Swaying back and forth wasn't her forte as a judo specialist, which primed her to always fixate her center of balance so that she never fell over. 

"O-Okay..."* - Thu Nov 12 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) imitates the swaying, trying to figure it out. Once she finally realized that she wasn't loose enough, she managed to do a couple of proper sways. Thankfully, Ichiro was kind enough to give her some guidance and hints as she tried to learn how to do his boxing stance.* - Thu Nov 12 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) nods.

"Alright... Thank you. What's your name, sir?" She asks.* - Thu Nov 12 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Ichiro. - Thu Nov 12 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: My name is Makoto. - Thu Nov 12 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Nice to meet you Makoto. - Thu Nov 12 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Mhmm. - Thu Nov 12 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Can we spar and train more?  - Thu Nov 12 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Sure. Shouldn't do any harm. - Thu Nov 12 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Alright... - Thu Nov 12 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Let's train. - Thu Nov 12 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Do you know any way to train? - Thu Nov 12 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: That's... - Thu Nov 12 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Effectif? - Thu Nov 12 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) pronounces 'effective' in a weird manner.* - Thu Nov 12 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: .... - Thu Nov 12 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Strange. - Thu Nov 12 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: So far, all I've done in terms of training is daily jogging and striking a tree a couple of times. - Thu Nov 12 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's basic but it gives results. - Thu Nov 12 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: There's no pets here. - Thu Nov 12 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Then..what is that thing? - Thu Nov 12 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: ...Huh? - Thu Nov 12 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) points at herself.

"Me?"* - Thu Nov 12 03:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | Her left foot inches forward so that her legs were shoulder-width apart. She formed a diagonal between her legs as her hands were shifted into the air in front of herself, in a comfortable position for her actions.

"Do you know what judo is?" She inquires, as she entered her stance.* - Sat Nov 14 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) moves forward towards Nigen. She dashes forward in fact, though she doesn't change the distance between her feet; her feet seem to move simultaneously together in forms of short leaps across the ground instead of straight-up running. 

It meant that there was little space between her and the ground when she lept, due to how short they were and how fast she was moving. Not only that, but it maintained her center of gravity. Once she had gotten close to Nigen, her right hand extends to attempt grabbing him by his shoulder. If done, Makoto's hand would reach for his tricep, her other hand ripping at his thigh.

She'd bring him into a fireman's carry and toss him onto the ground to perhaps cause a craterized formation on the ground where Nigen's body lands.* - Sat Nov 14 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) glances at Nigen, who laid on the ground. She was astounded by the fact that he simply questioned her art instead of groaned there in pain. 

"Yes... this is judo." She mutters. She wasn't sure what to expect. She was a grappler---she wasn't a Ninjutsu fighter if that was what this spar would be demanding. She waits for Nigen to get up though.

It was apart of her honor code.* - Sat Nov 14 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) waches Nigen as he erupts from the ground. Makoto keeps on watching him. As soon as he had risen, Makoto simply zooms to his side.

"What do you think I'm lacking?" Makoto questioned, a bit ticked that her fighting style, or perhaps her attitude in terms of fighting was being questioned. Makoto pushes forward this time, attempting to place her right hand upon his clothing. It'd reach for where his pectoral was to be.

Her free hand would move underneath his right sleeve into the tricep muscle. Quickly, by twisting her body, Makoto attempts to yank Nigen off of the ground. Her right elbow digs into Nigen's right shoulder once she turns around, aiming to toss him onto the ground once again with brutal force.* - Sat Nov 14 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) had quite literally slammed Nigen against the ground with another audible thud. Yet, Makoto's attacks weren't having any effect for some reason. Either this person was incredibly durable, or perhaps she was up against a masochistic Jashinist in disguise. Nonetheless, she doesn't let it lower her motivation and drive to pummel him in competition.

"Enough! You do not fight to kill. You fight to test your strength." Makoto shouted, biting her lip that her favorite style of fighting was being so easily mocked and rendered useless. However, Makoto had yet to even use her real moves. She waits for Nigen to get back up one more time. 

Makoto couldn't tell how much damage Nigen had taken since Nigen's facial expression was hidden and his voice didn't seem to be stuttering or wincing in pain. * - Sat Nov 14 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Continue! - Sat Nov 14 03:41:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What was it.."Taijutsu"? - Sat Nov 14 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: I'll strip away that silly ideology of her's... - Sat Nov 14 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) blinks. "I'm not going to fight with the intent to kill." Makoto determinedly said. "I don't kill for no reason." Makoto comments. She swiftly zooms forth towards Nigen though, deciding that this time, she'd release a different combination. Her right hand flickers forward to try and jab Nigen right in the skull.

If done, Makoto would twist to the side, reach out for Nigen's left hand, and yank it towards herself. Makoto would then twist her body, sliding her right leg in bewteen his feet in the same direction the two were facing. Once done, she'd twist her body and yank Nigen over, trying to flip him onto the ground and have him slam on his vertebrae.* - Sat Nov 14 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | Quite literally, Makoto had knocked Nigen to the ground for a third time. She backs off momentarily, waiting for her opponent to rise once more. Unfortunately, she is struck by a bolt of lightning that seems to fly into her out of nowhere, soaring into her person and blowing her backwards into a nearby tree. Makoto's eyes widen from the pain of the attack---she was not as durable against Ninjutsu as she was against Taijutsu. She lands onto the ground on one knee.

Makoto's eyes look back up to Nigen. She felt as if she had been hit by a gun. However, it wasn't in Makoto's personality to lose: she'd just need to take it up a notch further.

". . . I can't win like this. But I'll win like this!" Makoto shouted. 

Gate of Opening --- Open.

Once the Gate had been unleashed, Makoto dashes towards Nigen. Her right hand lunges out for Nigen's groin region.

She figured since he was a guy, his groin would be an impeccable weakness. Once he was stunned, she'd slam into his chest numerous times, before finally landing an uppercut.

"Seichun Godanzuki!"* - Sat Nov 14 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) doesn't exactly know what Nigen was incanting; clearly, it was not a good thing. Makoto slams her hands on the ground, noticing her depleted levels of stamina. She needed to recover --- and fast.

"Gate of Healing!" She whispers to herself.

She jolts upwards into the air, attempting to smash into Nigen with her shoulder and get him out of the air. If possible, she'd grab onto Nigen's body as a whole and tackle him into the ground to perhaps knock him out.* - Sat Nov 14 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) was stopped by the  necromancer's curse technique. Makoto landed on the ground, unsure of what exactly she could do to break this strange technique.

"W-What is this? This isn't fair." Makoto commented, as she struggles to break the binds of the curse.* - Sat Nov 14 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) snaps at him.

"I don't know fear! I am a warrior! A warrior fights for honor and glory. A warrior does not know fear."

She shouted at him. She doesn't take his hand.

"I don't want to hear it."* - Sat Nov 14 04:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) observes Nigen for a moment, biting her lip in agony. "Torture me all you'd like. I don't care!" Makoto shouted, gritting her teeth.

"You... you brought me out here for this." She mutters in response, rather angry at his conniving cunningness.* - Sat Nov 14 05:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) feels her dark energy being extracted from her person and pulled so that it was the most present upon her. She was being corrupted. Her arms wrapped around her body, cradling herself as her outlook and perspective on things were being rapidly changed by Nigen's technique.* - Sat Nov 14 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: How do you feel, Harlot-chan? - Sat Nov 14 19:43:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) found herself being carried by Nigen. Her arms wrap around Nigen's neck immediately out of fondness for her 'master' in a way. She doesn't utter a word though. * - Sat Nov 14 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: ........ - Sat Nov 14 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) caught vision of Nigen's face. For some reason, there was an amorous feeling lingering in her heart when she saw Nigen. It was probably a result of the corruption. However, Makoto wasn't the type of person to fall in love so easily---was she? Granted, her 'love' was a bit more twisted than ever because of how corrupted she became. 

"You don't look bad at all." She muttered.

"Almost normal." She attempts to poke his face. "If not for your torturesque fetishes."* - Sat Nov 14 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even now, I bet you're curious as to what I'll do with you? - Sat Nov 14 20:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) stretches momentarily, stripping off her scarf from her father; it symbolized sentimental value for her family.

"What am I looking for? Strength. Power to become the strongest in this world.~" She whimsically spoke, as though it were nothing to achieve. "So you call that rewarding? I liked it though, so I suppose." She states, speaking much more clearly for some reason. She was abandoning a lot of what she stood for principally in the past.

"Go ahead, tell me what you're going to do with me."* - Sat Nov 14 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Don't worry, though. I'm not so twisted that I'd get off to raping people. - Sat Nov 14 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even though to be honest, I doubt you'd resist. - Sat Nov 14 20:08:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: I don't mind you -penetrating- me if that's what you're asking. - Sat Nov 14 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Though I don't want it -there-. - Sat Nov 14 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Understandable.~ - Sat Nov 14 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) rolls around to face Nigen.

"Proper path of strength. Well, show me the light.~"* - Sat Nov 14 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It shall become clear to you that this world is filled with nothing, but heathens.. - Sat Nov 14 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Some are more likable than others. - Sat Nov 14 20:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If someone disrespects you. The old you would've just let it go, maybe ask them to spar and compare strength. - Sat Nov 14 20:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) says: Just put them down and show them their place.~ - Sat Nov 14 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Your first set of attacks were great. The potential to physically damage your opponent was there. - Sat Nov 14 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Not only is it quite attractive, but also..think of the joy you'd feel.. - Sat Nov 14 20:12:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Throwing your opponent to the ground, before putting your foot on their chest. Muttering the words, "Beg..for your life.." - Sat Nov 14 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If they refuse you get the satisfaction of killing them! - Sat Nov 14 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If that's too quick, you could slowly break their limbs. - Sat Nov 14 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You could always start with their digits, maybe a pinky? - Sat Nov 14 20:14:17 2015
