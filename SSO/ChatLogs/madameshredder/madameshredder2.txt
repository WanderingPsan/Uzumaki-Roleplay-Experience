When Lyan spoke to her, she responds with: "Daijoubu desu." 

It was just confirmation that she was okay. She continues her walking. She was moving on her hands; this Taijutsu practititioner simply wants to train her biceps & tricep muscles to their fullest potential and maximize the processes that were building up her collagenous fibers.

Her sweat begins to proliferate after the fiftieth lap around the small circle she had made for herself, which was akin to a wrestling ring. Her sweat drips on the gravel and soils the earth underneath her forehead. 

She utters not a single word as she furthered her training to rigorous extents. It could almost be described as strenuous and to a half-wit, could even be considered insane. But for a ninja, it was typical, especially if she was a Taijutsu Specialist.* - Sat Oct 24 04:16:25 2015

She stands after bending her ankles, with her halluxes bending deeply into the earth, grinding up the gravel & soil with their digging. Makoto resettles her line of sight on Ai, exchanging her facial expression from one of severity of practice, to one of a friendly nature. 

"Welcome....back." She manages to say English, almost perfectly.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | It was a sudden approach that Makoto appreciated. She hated beating around the bush and this man wasn't one of those people fortunately. Makoto nears Koji as his hands approach and swiftly extends her arm in the way of his arm. Unfortunately, the two strikes are far too quick for her to counter, closing the two tenketsu points near her shoulders. She is baffled by the attack, seeing as she had never encountered a tenketsu-point user in her life.

As the kicks approach though, Makoto aims to intercept it. Her right arm aims to wrap around the femur in a defensive effort to block the attack. She winces out of pain, because of the tenketsu closure in her shoulder; however, she was bold and her will was strong. She wouldn't allow herself to be felled by the first two attacks.

"Kata Guruma." Her free arm jets out to grab hold of Koji's arm. If unsuccessful, it transitions to his collar and aims to place him on her shoulders. If done, she'd toss him onto the ground, hopefully doing enough damage to knock some of the wind out of him. * - Sat Oct 24 05:40:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) is literally tossed to the side. The rotation was unexpected. Makoto found herself unable to stand her ground against the rotational force of his defensive technique, which propelled her to the ground. She slides along the dirt and gravel, landing on the back of her head. 

As soon as she had landed though, Koji had been ontop of her. A Gentle Fist assault is launched on her right arm.

Whilst it is executed though, Makoto juts out with her two feet, trying to bullkick Koji in the chest and get him off of her body before all six strikes were executed in time, out of instinct and desperation.* - Sat Oct 24 05:54:33 2015

She allows him to do as he pleases. She brought her left hand to her right shoulder and parts the training gi that she was wearing to reveal her shoulder better for Koji.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) was hugged. Afterwards, his hand was placed underneath her chin and....her chin was lifted up.

So many misinterpretations. Makoto's cheeks blush and she backs away quickly. She wasn't an idiot when it came to social things, at the very least. She just couldn't speak the language.

"N-Nanio surundayou?!" She seemed startled and surprised. Her hands were covered by his hands and she mistakes it for some kind of confession. 

However, when he started to guide her hands over the words, she relaxes.

"O-Okay..." She murmurs, unsurely.* - Sat Oct 24 07:40:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) places her hand on the ground. She leans against her arms and brings her arms into a ninety degree angle against the ground. These were rhythmic push-ups that she was executing. She left her arms at her sides instead of out towards the sides of her head. Her goal was to train her bicep and tricep muscles even further than she normally may.

She executes push-ups rapidly, quickly, and expertly. She utters not a word during her training exercise and just chugs on. * - Sat Oct 24 15:46:46 2015

When Kilm speaks though, Makoto shows no notice of his speech. Maybe she was deaf, or maybe she didn't understand what he was saying. Nonetheless, if she understood the language, maybe her face would contort, but none of that was occurring during her training regiment.* - Sat Oct 24 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) finishes up her regiment of push-ups. She sits up in criss-cross position and remains there for some time, resting her muscles. * - Sat Oct 24 15:52:44 2015

She kiai'd with each of her pushups. It was a practice that most martial arts used and she was emitting her ethereal 'spirit' with each of her vocals. She bends her elbows at perfect ninety degrees, to the point her chest touched the ground each time she push-up'd, without actually giving way for her entire body to just plop onto the ground. * - Sat Oct 24 16:41:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: But like, action missions. - Sat Oct 24 17:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Maybe hunt down some rogue ninja on the outskirts. - Sat Oct 24 17:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Something like that. - Sat Oct 24 17:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | She observes Koji's motions. She lifts up her right arm and sticks it out in front of herself, only to join in an expeditious series of movements afterwards as she slides her right leg back and drives her left foot through the ground so that they were shoulder-width apart. She starts to close the distance between the two of them.

However, something else was different about Makoto. Makoto watches Koji more carefully than ever; this time, she looked like she was -bracing- herself for something. As though she was preparing herself for some pain, already recognizing she'd have to take some hits.* - Sat Oct 24 17:19:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | She kiai's as she engages with Koji. Quickly, Makoto unleashes her body. It wasn't that though. When Koji had struck out at her and tried to hit her left leg, Makoto unlocks the Gate of Opening. As soon as the torso strike lands, Koji's elbow finds itself encountering a fortified body that had been honed through days of training.

She wouldn't be able to move as effectively with her right leg wounded. However, if Koji decided to go with such a strike, her body would be more than fortified enough to mitigate it to ignorable extents. Her right hand jets out towards his tricep and aims to grip hold of him. 

She'd lean her body against his, preventing him from moving his hands by grabbing both of his forearms. If done, she'd try to prevent him from any spinning by grounding him with pure force.

"Morote Seoinage!" She shouts. Her back is against Koji's chest while both of her hands are on his forearms to try and prevent them from moving. She'd then yank his arms forward and she'd bend her back, trying to have him thrown off of her back as a launch pad and onto the ground with a sickening thud.* - Sat Oct 24 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Kilm, you're awfully close to that spar. - Sat Oct 24 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: At least...The world isn't as dark...A few dim lights are around... - Sat Oct 24 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | Suddenly, the Rotation is withstood. Makoto literally shoves her hands meaningfully through the Rotation. Having braced for the rotational damage, Makoto was not only demonstrating a degree of physical aptitude, but a degree of reckless courage & valiance. 

Her hands reach for his hands before the rotation fully sets in, perhaps stopping it in its place if done. Her right knee raises itself and prompts itself to smash into Koji's stomach and cave it inwards for stunning purposes.* - Sat Oct 24 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizune, Makoto(MadameShredder) | | The knee had struck him. Luckily, Makoto still maintained her grip on his hands. She was restraining him, trying to prevent him from using any of those pesky moves of his. Another knee had been unleashed from her free leg, the leg that wasn't disabled by the tenketsu closure earlier. She was trying to use her overwhelming strength to try and punish Koji enough for her throw to be effective.

Makoto was impressed though, by the durability of her foe. Her foe looked to have spirit & physical strength. His stability was also nothing to mock. "Impressive." She said in English. It was just to compliment him, nothing more, nothing less.* - Sat Oct 24 18:27:12 2015
