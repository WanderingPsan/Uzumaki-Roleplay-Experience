<br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) had a longing for his sand filled home. He went to Sunagakure on his sand platform. She wanted to do the right thing dfrom now on and repay Suna... He was serious in his goal as he left in a flash* - Sun Aug 30 23:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) Thinks of Paine as a taijutsu user as he flys across the sky... "Beautiful... I really want to see her soon" he said still flying looking at the direction of Konoha and trying to put a music player on his profile.* - Mon Aug 31 00:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) went to train in switching between targets. He needed to learn how switch attack targets and switch from jutsu to jutsu with ease. He would first pop his gourd and shoot some sand shuriken off in the distance as she threw them he raised his arm foward and up and summoned a sand clone after they were shot. He would then turn around and try to cloak his body in sand armor and form a sand shield to complete the combo. He was fast with the reaction but it wasnt really that special since he was not getting attacked in combat. He would dispel all of his sand and put it back in his gourd. This was tiring and used alot of chakra, plus he was tired already so he decided he was going to do this tomorrow.* - Mon Aug 31 01:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) was sad, and lost... he was happy that the corposes were not there and talking but it was too quiet... He walked in the village alone... He thought about the body that called him uncle... He wanted to know more about her... the only person he could remember calling him uncle was Katya... Was that her? He thought about this for a second as the sand clones dug deeper and deeper into the earth to make more sand for him to control. Very soon he would flood the whole area with sand that way the area would be his play ground... He was happy yet sad. He wanted to be with at least one person... yes that one person he always wanted... the person that wouldnt judge him and would love him unconditionally... the person that wouldnt leave him. The sand clones here continues to drill they were half way in a hole providing more and more sand for him to use . All the clumps of sand had been enfused with his chakra and litered the ground. The ground would slowly resemble a sand box and the sand began pile up... "I need to buy more explosive tags... " he uttered as he spent the last tags on the attack on kumo...* - Mon Aug 31 01:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210)  wanted to make this place a base of operations for him so he decided he needed to get more sand in this area. He used his sand to form two sand clones. He would morph the arms of the sand clones to that of drills; all this was made of high density sand of course. With the drills he would make the clones drill into the ground for two reasons, One: to grind up the already earth on the ground to sand with the high speed drills and two: to dig deep into the earth to find more sand for him to use. This was crucial to this base at it would provide more sand for him to use besides his gourd. When the sand would be formed in the area he would enfuse his chakra into the sand and lay it around the area for protection purposes... This prevented him to use all of his sand in his gourd* - Mon Aug 31 01:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) needed to train and hone his skills... his skill were dull and needed sharpening. He would pop his gourd and his sand would flow out and be airborne. He would shoot out two torrents of sand and placed on the ground. He would summon a sand clone from the torrent and it would be an exact copy of Kronos made of sand. The other sand torrent would form a sand platform next to the sand clone... This point of his training was to decrease the delay between his jutsu. It was what he had to do to increase his abilities with his jutsu. His speed was still alow but he couldnnt give up. He would also train his jutsu in the process, getting a better at his jutsu was the best plan of action.* - Mon Aug 31 01:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) did not have his gourd so he had to practice his elemental ninjutsu... He would continue to shorten the delay on his hand seals and he would first weave his first set of hand seals... and inhale deeply forming a fireball as he exhaled the massive fire ball. The fire ball would leave a huge scorch mark on the tree or destroy it one. Then he would weave his second set of handseals immediatly after the first and after the fireball to surge chakra into his finger tips... After the surge he would shoot out a broad stream of lightining that would break and destroy the damaged tree. He would marvel at his work but think... "I need to add more power into it..." he said to himself...* - Mon Aug 31 01:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) trained hard on mastering the timing on the delays between his jutsu... he focused his timing and tried again. He could close his eyes and slowly form each individual jutsu hand seal and take a deep breath and thread chakra in his stomach... Then he exhaled his fire and unleasehed fire ball at yet another tree. When he finished his fireball he slowly weaved the second set of hand seals and concentrated his chakra into the palms of his then focused that chakra to his fingertips where lightning would surge from his fingers would surge forward and strike down another tree. He would repeat this progress to slowly reduce the delay of his techniques to nothing..* - Mon Aug 31 01:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) went to the field to work on a little more control. He erected severals clones made of sand around him. Each clone was an exact likeness of the original, the all stood a fair amount of tiles away from him and slowly stared to form hand seals. The seals were formed in a slow pace and it would take them a while to actually a while to finish thim. While they were doing this he quickly formed several seals of his own and inhaled deeply. He would knead chakra into his stomach and exhale it in one big fire ball to shoot out at the first clone. He was delayed from the jutsu but pushed forward and turned to the next clone. He weaved more hand seals as the clones continued to weave the slow moving hand seals that were almost half way finished. He then finished and charged up lightning chakr ain his hands to his finger tips. He would fire the stream of lightning at the second clone and she quickly turned to the last clone to do one final move but as he looked the clone finished his last hand seal. "Fucking damnit, I need to get faster... " he yelled. anyone in the vicinity could hear him.
* - Mon Aug 31 01:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) uncrossed his arms and erected three clones that stood a 10 feet away from him in each direction and started to slowly rotate around him. He would weave several hand seals and inhale deeply storing charkra in his stomach. He was aiming for the moving target, or more so the potential spot of the moving target because that was the smart play... He turned to aim the fireball at one of the moving clones. he exhaled the chakra and it converted to a huge fire ball that was launched from his person... The clone was obliterated by the fire ball and that left two on the rotating clone surrounding him. He would experience a disorientating effect as he felt jutsu lag but he fought through it and weaved several more hand seals in prep for his next attack charging lightning chakra to this hands and then to his finger tips. 
As the next clone came into view he released he next move which was a large stream of lighting that also decimated the clone, ripping it apart as it fell back to sand. He would look over to see the last clone still rotating around for his last attack. He was exhausted, he was sweating, he was dizzy, but he was almost done...
 He struggled but he slowly weaved his last set of sand seals and pointed his shaking finger towards the last moving clone. The clone path was a ring of fire that surrounded him. The clone itself was then wrapped in fire as it popped and feel to the ground but not from the fire... it was most likely due to the loss of concentration from Kronos. He used three jutsu in a row annd was bone tired and stressed. He over exceeded his limit and he was barely able to walk. He slowly but surely retracted his sand into his gourd and wobbled back to the others...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) High in the skys of suna was a lone sand cloud in the sky... It was a familiar sight to alot of residents in Suna... It was a sign of both pain and misfortune... I sigh of triuph and struggle... Lone cloud that slowly desended from the heavens.

The Idea poped in everyones head... 

"Kronos has come..."

Kronos had his left eye covered as a sand eye was watching over him from every direction for and type of attack. He was well hated in Suna for good reason. He caused so much pain as he left. He missed his village and he never forgot his heritage... He may have lost his way but his goals remained the same. He may have left but his heart stayed in Suna. 

Even when he left everthing thing he did he though of helping Suna it was his only idea that kept him sane...

"Dravae retract your bugs... I dont want to hurt you... I am not here to hurt anyone... First I want to pay my respects to the fallen shinobi of my era. Then I want to talk to Chiiyari." he said casually. His deamenor was firm and cuninng; he was in no way threating or feeling threatened.* - Tue Sep 01 01:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) went to the graves of his fallen village members... Kastya, Katya, Savae, Jak, Adhura, Amu... He went on a line saying a few words over each grave...

Jak- "We may have had differences but you aknowledged my skills Sir; you were such a fool at times."

Adhara- "You were hard yet kind on us my lady..."

Savae- "You got on my nerves but I always loved you little brother... Sad to see you died with a fool."

Katya- "I wish I was there to save you my little niece..."

Amu- "I wish I was able to save you... Amu please be save I will get you back some day... if your alive. *cluches her invention in his hand*"

Kastya- "I have always loved you... I wish we would have been together earlier on; but im glad we were best friends. We will always be close Kas..."

He grinded sand over every grave and claped his hands together and bowed to them... "I will join you some day but I still have alot to accomplish" he finish as he floated to the top of the mansion and sat on the building. Waiting on Chiiyari to appear to him* - Tue Sep 01 02:11:12 2015

He... <clenched his fist from painful memories> had to die. I am not sorry for my actions toward... the man that I saved and killed." He would pull out the robes of tategama, they were also stained with blood as he placed the mask on top of the blooded robes and floated it down to Chiyari's feet.

"I did not come here to fight, I have come home... I wish to return to my village and make it whole yet again." he said as he reverted back to his casual but firm stand.* - Wed Sep 02 00:25:48 2015

"First, I want to donate all of my money I have earned through the years to Suna... One million dollars of my own money towards Suna. Secondly I will take the Gezo Private exam as a rep for Suna..." this was surely a big repayment towards the village that he loved.

"I admit that I have caused alot of pain to Suna thats why I left... I needed to get away I needed to find out who I really was. I lost control and I found my way in and out of darkness... everything i did while I was gone it was for Suna...  I never forgot about my village and I have always loved my village even though it hated me." he said sounding heart felt, he told no lies in his speech. 

"This is my way of righting my wrongs and leaving my village in its time of need but I had no choice... I have been through alot to get where I am today and I am thankful for my path; but its time for Suna to rise again... and it starts with the Gezo." he finished his voice and eyes were filled with deternimation. * - Wed Sep 02 02:15:02 2015

"It was not a bribe... I was funds to help rebuild Suna... I would never bribe anyone... thats not my nature. " he said accepting his hand shake. "I also have one more present to give...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) Also weaved followed lead and summoned a several ground hogs to tunnel to the gate of Suna and prepare a trap for the enemy... The ground hogs to begin to tunnel a massive whole outside of Suna and for a giant pit fall trap...

The ground hogs would appear and quickly tunnel underground towards the gate* - Wed Sep 02 20:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) was in the center of the gate floating on a flying sand platform... "Ride or Die..." he uttered* - Wed Sep 02 20:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) "Sighed... It always me..." He said as he would rise in the air away from the others... the main target was Kronos so he planned to keep it that way... 

His sand would erupt from his gourd in a dramatic fashion...  "I will show you the true power of manipulation!" The sand in the air would twinkle in the sunlight. It was more than just sand in the his regular sand... It was a mix of sand and gold dust in his sand... The sand mix would form a sand dome surrounding him and protect him from the firey wind explostion... The dome of sand was 3 times bigger than usual... he was going for maximum coverage and protection.

"I will protect this village with my life... And I and I have accepted my death so so be it! This will be our final battle Zetsumo... a clash of titans!!!" she shouted in the dome... His mind started moving and thinking of a strategy to win this difficult battle...

Meanwhile the groundhogs underneath Zetsumo and his monsters would continue to dig a massive pit fall under him... The ground hogs  worked hard and it would take a while to form but it was only a matter of time until it was completed* - Wed Sep 02 21:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) There were three medium sized groundhogs burrowing undergound under Zetsumo and his army. The groundhogs glided effortlessly through the dirt and sand at high speeds... As they were animals naturally able to dig so no normal human would be able to catch them unless they had similar abilities and features... that or they were just as fast as a animal in their terrain.

The ground hogs finished the top layer of the trap and preseeded to move deeper under ground. The ground hogs were moving in a circular pattern, spriral method of digging. They were in a staggered position with one groundhog on top of another in a three line demolition crew and one groundhog 1 full position behind the other.

If they were attacked they would scatter and form random tunnels to avoid being poofed away. The groundhogs were 15 feet underground and quickly decending.* - Wed Sep 02 22:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) Sand has a complete immunity towards Fire Release, with it being the only substance which Amaterasu, the highest level Fire Release technique, has yet to burn into or through.[16][17]* - Wed Sep 02 22:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) Kronos shield of sand was destroyed and the spread across the field. His only option was to fly closer to the ground and protect hisself... He had no option but to trigger the pit fall from the ground hogs... He dropped from the sky and covered his self in sand armor to take the rest of the impact from the weakened but still powerful fire blast... the sand armor protected himself from the fire damage but it did force him to the ground with a heavy thud.

He was forced to the ground by the wind with a thud. The thud triggered a chain reaction that caused his wide range pit fall of 20 feet now to open. He wanted to make it deeper but the fall would prematurely trigger it. The ground would crack away and fall, it captured Zetsumo, the 4 monsters, Beth, and Paine; along with any troops in range.

Kastune who was underground would feel the crushing impact of the ground collapsing... if she wasnt reflexive  she would either be heavily injured or dead from being crushed from the falling monsters or soilders. The ground hogs would be crushed but the would poof away from any more damage.* - Wed Sep 02 23:09:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) was not impacted by mud because the explostion by Zetsumo's monsters was immenslely strong and it would have likely blown away the mud coming toward him he was on the ground unhindered... hurt but unhindered* - Thu Sep 03 00:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kronos(Ninjagangster90210) As he fell from the sky after 4 pillers of earth came crashing into his body. Even if he had the sand armor on it was burnt and blown away from the first attack. It seemed that Zetsumo planned to take out the biggest threat first. He succeeded in doing so; Kronos was taken out of the game early and that made thinks alot easier for Zetsumo to take over.

Kronos's reign was over... he felt his death coming, he seen it a mile away. It was destined to happen. He was a hero, a villian, a nice guy, and a dick. Suna has lost another one of his children, perhaps of of the strongest they ever had. In his dying moments He thought about the last person that he knew was alive from day one academy... Tetsumi. No one but the citzens of Suna knew of his... other side. He hoped that noone outside of Suna would ever find out.

As he body feel to the floor cold and motionless what would happen... how would people reaction? Would the rejoice that the monster was dead? Would they cry over his death... who knows... But one thing was for sure. The world would remember his name... With a dying breath he would smile and say...

He had three options to go on. He would either attack amai; run towards Mamoru; or run in the black of nothing... Either way he was trying to be proactive in this spar as the others probuly had a smarter method.* - Sat Sep 05 23:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) //as the none reflexive type his leg was impacted by the blade and he hurt, "Damn it" she said as he kneeled down and was impacted by a heavy foot. She slide backwards alittle as the mist faded alittle. Visibility was bad but better now. Keyshawn was clearly acting stupid and heeded to train more. His body landed in front of Amai as he got up to tried to get back in stance... He was not sandwitched between the two* - Sat Sep 05 23:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) //as soon as he got up he was choked by amai and she attack his adams apple, "Oh no!" he said as he started to cough uncontrollablely on the floor. That was a low blow... dirty move! He strugged to regain his composure...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) went to practice his jutsu. He practiced his shushin techinque and teleported a shot distance away. The jutsu put a great strain on him and made him exausted and dizzy, the effects of the jutsu were harsh and it was not visible in combat but it would be well worth it in the long run. He shook his head and got out of the effects of the jutsu after a short while of resting. He began to prepare for the next jutsu so he could move to bigger and better things.

He again tried to use his shushin ability to basically "teleported" back to the same location. He was really impressed with potential of the technique... this was before he throw up on the ground as he tried to get used to the technique. "Oh man... this move... is terrible, it better be worth it..." he said sweating perfusly and breathing heavy... He swayed back and forth as he could barely stand. He would then stand there for a while and catch his breath and slow his heart rate. When he got up he went back to the mountai to relax... any more training of that move might kill him.* - Sun Sep 06 11:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) was a kid from the ghetto. He was educated and could switch from slang to proper language with ease. He just switched when it was ever appropriate. He was a tall ten year old at 5'2'' with unusually cold breath as a characteristic. "Im Keyshawn who you be?" he said* - Sun Sep 06 19:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) REALLY didnt want to do this... He waited for everyone to enter and reluncently stayed behind and in the shadows... He made sure to watch his own surrounds with a paranoid sense of things. He would be right between the kage and his army... "I dont want to die here..." he thought to himself. The 10 year old was very cauious and checking and double checking for traps and ninja as he shecked everywhere from the ground to the sky and stayed reflexive... Anyone could tell the boy was jumpy* - Sun Sep 06 20:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) Was saddened... he wasnt going to enjoy this... perhaps he would has a easy opponent... perhaps they would accept his surrender? None the less he reluctenly followed Yuan hoping he would protect him... "Oh, man this sucks..." he was still paranoid and always kept his guard up* - Sun Sep 06 21:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) Was suprised as alot more people showed up... They were not close so he didnt punch them... "Great more body shields to hide behind" she said hoping not to die in this place... He carefully followed Yuan and preceeded to their destined location. Behind him of course; he would watch all surrounds for anything suspicious. He moved as fast as Yuan moved and kept his eyes peeled. If they were there aleast... he was paranoid he didnt care.

As for the measures the kage took for the traps... he assumed they worked and headed down the pathway. 

Well looks like shit hit the fan... time to run... Nigga was here... Keyshawn attempt to crawl back through the hole as he slowly hid hehind everyone... while he runs he says in his head

"FUCK THIS SHIT IM OUT~"* - Sun Sep 06 21:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) Everyone is after amai... the ground troops are getting destroyed... Keyshawn in is the hole... He dips out of the hole and runs like hell at 80 mph... still singing in his head "Fuck this shit im out~"* - Sun Sep 06 22:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) As destruction was happining all BEHIND him he still ran as fast as he could... He was not delaying hisself to find out what is happening behind him he was scared shitless. He ran and ran and ran... fuck Zetsumo, fuck dying, fuck sensors, he wanted to live... Being the chicken he would continue to run around every thing in his path and punch any distraction trying to impeed his escape... STILL SINGING, "Fuck this shit im out..."

He would be out of sensor range by now and out of visual range too* - Sun Sep 06 22:30:11 2015

He is -CLEARLY- away from any and all warefare... Just becasue Zeno didnt teleport him out the whole it doesnt mean he didnt leave out of it. Zeno is clearly confused with clusterfuck going on and didnt use his god powers to let him get away...

Note:Keyshawn is -NOT- in his IC position what so ever.

He will avoid any and evey war struggle and navigate past diasters... He would punch anything in his was as he runs and avoids all combat. "Suna is fucked, Kumo is fucked, Kiri is fucked..." He was either joining the OP god that cant die or the village that Kenshin used to live in. He was not dying any time soon..* - Sun Sep 06 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) stayed in the forest punching everything that was a threat to him as he uses his ninja skills to hide in the trees and waited to hear the rumors and soilder chatter to figure out what happened in the battle he left from. He had very few options Village wise... 

Kumo was going to KOS; Suna was fucked; Kiri was not an option as his alt was in the Kiri... 

SO village wise it was only Kono as a slave/POW or Amegakure as a captive... Hopefully he wont die. though... He really wanted to pick the best option that avoided dead...* - Sun Sep 06 23:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) As chaos and destruction continued Keyshawn would punch the occastional animal and stay hidden behind his tree, he would swtich trees everynow and then toprevent getting caught... for now. He would continue to hear the chatter of everyone around... he would have took away all resemblace of being a kumogakure ninga at this moment.

He was a black ninja with ice cold breath...he looked generic as fuck... He planned how he would come up to amegakure or konohagakure... "Mix tape sellsman? Surrender immediatly? Soo many options..." he thought gathering his ideas up. He wondered if his brother would do the same in his shoes.

Yet he would it was natural for black people to run in the same direction as other black people... it was natural... * - Mon Sep 07 01:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) heard the battle was over from rumors; he would follow any soilders in secret and is he ran into any danger? He would run away... why would he run away? He had a strong influence in his head that told him to do so...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) Ran back to the hole, he continued to punch all in his path, he had to make up an excuse to running away from the battle. Noone  was watching him the entire time so noone would have known what he would have done. He heard that the battle was over to see what happened...

The battlefield looked terrible and dead bodies were everywhere as he looks through hole. He dirtied hisself and tore his clothing to simulate battle. He would hang out the hole and say "UGH Lord Nizaaaaaaa" he said "struggling" "I-I thought you died"* - Mon Sep 07 04:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) looked at the unswayed raikage... he had to say SOME truth right? "Ok I ran back out the hole and tried to call for back up..." he said with a more confident answer* - Mon Sep 07 05:06:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) He didnt like where this was going... Keyshawn would slowly dip away becasue of the fear of death... "Fuck this shit im out..." she starts to sing again.

Using his speed he would run and be out of range of any attack. * - Tue Sep 08 01:54:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) was sleeping under a tree, what happened last night was shocking and suprising but he would kept his mouth shut because he was afraid that that info would get him killed which was bad. He sushed up about it and got up from his tree and walked out all cool and ninja like avoiding people from seeing him.

"I wonder where Niza is?" he thought to himself...* - Wed Sep 09 00:08:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) Would get in his stance; he lifted his fist to his face as a guard and ducked down alittle, he then bounced on his toes staying light and agile. Would his stance bring back memories of Tatsumi? After all tatsumi's stance was similar but stronger. Keyshawn ran ahead at Yan building up his speed but not revealing the direction of his attack. His shoulders were even and his fists were close to his body at eequal length. 

Keyshawn was confident facing weak or equal shinobi. I was the overly strong that scared him. He would close the distance and remain on standby.* - Wed Sep 09 01:41:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) Would target the first clone headed toward him and commence his attack. He would start with a strong staight jab of a pretty good speed at the clone. His aim was to destroy it. He never seen any clone jutsu before but the acadamy informed him about "basic clone". "This one hitter quitter should take it out" he said as he assumed one punch would destroy it. Yan summoned the clones quickly and his only choice was to react fast enough to knock them down as he poofed them up.

If the clone was destroyed on the first hit then he would jump over it  and it would slow him down as he was not a free runner; but he was surrounded by two more clones so he could not attack him directly.

 If the clone was not destroyed in the first hit then he would attempt a second impact at his stomach trying to destroy it in 2 go's instead of one, then he would stay agressive for the second clones but not move past the first* - Wed Sep 09 02:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) was caught off guard as the water surged towards him, he crossed his arms in front of him to take the damage, it hurt but he could still fight. "If only I learned that move..." he thought to himself as he would be flung back and travelling along the ground in a thick mud river. He was in a situation that he could not get out of and he contemplated retreating... every time he though about doign a strategic withdrewal he would consult the man in his head:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0

But he wanted to see how it would play out first... He was dragged away from the mud as he took even more damage... "One more hit like that and im done for... I have to think this through..." he said covered in mud and soaking wet. He would slowly get up and recollect hisself...* - Wed Sep 09 02:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) As he was as dry as he was going to get he would sprint to him as fast as he could... He was indeed a fast opponent, but it seemed that Keyshawn was faster... it came in handly for running away. He would then quickly move to the position directly in front of Yan and attack both clones with strong impacts to the head hoping to destroy them. Lastly he would try one last impact wi the gut of Yan hoping to land ONE hit this spar.

Keyshawn was trying to in but this was a way to fight and not risk death* - Wed Sep 09 02:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) would impact the first clone, "Boom... Headshot"; then Yan would presumingly say in his mind "You triggered my trap card!" and Keyshawn was like "Fuck you mirror force!" as he was captured in mud. But he was like "mother can I have another?" and popped the second clone; "Double-kill" echoed in his head. Yan reacted like "You done fucked up now... take it deep boiiii" as he launched another water blast at his unguarded body... it hurt like a bitch as  he was flung back yet again. "If only I mastered this fucking move..." she thought as his ability was still go unshown. He would get up mud and water soaked and say, "You win... I cant take another  open hit like that" he said as he was dusting hisself off* - Wed Sep 09 03:17:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) was bored so he decided to train for once in his life. He was the only ninja left in his village that was active and had a personality. Everyone else was either; not active, dead, or kidnapped. Plus he had to be the rock for the Raikage, even if he was a coward. He would first spray a uncharacteristicly cold mist from his mouth then he would seem to "teleport" form his spot to an area in the mist that was farther away then the first spot.

He would get extremely disorientated and dizzy, he started throwing up from the inital uses of the technique. But he didnt stop... he kept it up... He would look to an area in the mist and tried to dicern the actual location. From there he would teleport to the area and force his self to strike twice before he would succumb to the effects of the shusin ability.* - Sat Sep 12 01:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) would continue to spray the mist in the area, coating the area with the cold mist, he would slowly get his eyes accustomed to the mist as he sprays. He then starts to quickly do a series of jumps and run around, trying to mask his movements and muffle them. He wanted to stay light and slient as he moved in the mist to get an element of suprise. He would train on this and other things as he trained to be a master in speed and stealth. Who would attack a guy who they couldnt see or catch... noone thats who.

He would then shushin two more times and try to land a two piece combos before the after effects kicked in. But when they did take effect he was in trouble. He threw up and his head was spinning, he passed out after he barfed and laid in the mist until he was ready to start training again. "Man this jutsu better be worth it after im done..." he argued* - Sat Sep 12 02:34:40 2015
