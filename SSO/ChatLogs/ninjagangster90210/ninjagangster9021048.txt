He would resonate his light mana in his body to his hands in a slight white glow. He felt her strong good nature, it was a sweet nutruring one. It was suitable for a nurse. He would then ask her, "Personally, have you commited any evil acts in your life?" he pursued.* - Fri Nov 20 09:06:08 2015

Also taking another life is also a big sin... Both are indeed commandment breaking and evil, yet you do not resonate evil." he wondered holding her hand still. Any evil would feela heavy burn by now, "I assume you would even guard such evil if it agreed with your views.. you confuse me." he said letting go of her hand and reaching for his cup.

He poured another cup and slowly drank it, he didnt look like he was succoming tot he alcohol at all. "Would you love evil?" he said next.* - Fri Nov 20 09:14:40 2015

The bible was between his elbows as the were clasped together at the hands in front of his mouth. He would lean in, deepness in his voice as he explained. "The Tenryuujoutei temple, has been fighting the Huevo Del Diablo for as long as I can remember. While we produce priests with light mana, the produce necromancers with dark mana. We are polar opposites that have raged war with each other." 

"Necromancers are liers, cheaters, thiefs, bigots, and anarchists. The live to cause destruction to humanity and are immoral people. They seek power from evil and will kill their own friends if they have to... The are vile scum.." he finished* - Fri Nov 20 09:49:39 2015
