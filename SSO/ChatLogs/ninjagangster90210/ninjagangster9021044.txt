Before he did anything he would corse chakra through his hands and they would glow a bright white. "Lets get that healed up quickly.." he smiled  running his hands over the cut. Her cells would regenerate to their original state and she would feel a plesent aura wash over her.

"Now that I healed you up, you can go change and shower... Do you need any clothing or anything else? Also do you need me to step outside?" he asked guarding the door for the moment and attending to her needs.* - Tue Nov 17 07:19:02 2015

Bryson was in the way, he still didnt trust the brute but he tried to be nice. He would look at the man. "Kiyoko is fine... she is just alittle tramatized is all. I healed  her and im about to see if she wants to talk. I understand you want to see her and all but I dont want any raging or anything so can you please wait in the waiting room until she is cleaned up?" he asked

He would look back at Kiyoko and prayed in his head... <Another child has returned to your Lord.>* - Tue Nov 17 07:36:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Would look at her... he didnt care for shinobi values. He only cared for the lives of the shinobi. "I dont know or care whats going on here... Im not worried about that. Im a priest, my job is to nurse her back to health with my skills. You can talk while I do what I can to keep her funcationing normally. Your loss is a terrible one and I will pray for you but your problems are not mine." I was obvious Bryson was a stubborn one when it came to his patients; he would never leave the side of the injured or hurt. 

Although she was healled her heart was damaged and he would find a way to fix it. "If you want to talk to the shinobi then talk to her I will still be here but reading my bible with earplugs but im not leaving this room." he said in a deep voice as he sat on front of the bed. "So you can take her in the shower and wash her while you talk to her... I would prefer you do that."* - Tue Nov 17 08:01:42 2015

"Look we are all calm here, and Kiyoko is fine aside from the emotional baggage. We are, well Im not against you. But you have to understand that there is a time and place for everything. Im trying to nurse her back to health... I have have you an option to talk to her freely and privatly while we are both in the room still... no problems at all." he said with a voice of reason.

"I don't know what going on nor do I really care as long as Kiyoko is recovering fine" he looked over to her with concern. "What do you want? Are you ok with the talk or do you want to have it later... its really your decision since your the patient." he would await her choice and follow her wishes. "I dont sense any hostility in you so I know you wont do anything rash."* - Tue Nov 17 08:26:27 2015
