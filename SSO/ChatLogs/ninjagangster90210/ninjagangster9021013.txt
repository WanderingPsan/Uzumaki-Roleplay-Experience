He walked to another outpost, going to do the work of the Lord and Hassan. His white cloat swayed in the wind as his hooded figure walked the long path. It took him an hour or two as he drank his bottle of water every now and again to keep his self hydraded. 

He saw the outpost in the distance and wasnt suprised that no one greeted him. "Well I guess it would be pretty wierd if someone were to greet me and they are all dead..." he said with a somber tone. He would roll up his sleeves and plot out all the graves. Each grave would be inside of the outpost, he would mark the place as a graveyard and condem it. The graves would be about 6 inches away from each other... not too close and not too far.

After he would mark the grave spots he would count out the number of graves to the number of people, it was exhausting work but someone had to do it. After he got the head count of 120 people he would then grab his shovel and start digging. It took him quite a while to dig all the holes by his self as this task would take hours to do. He finished half of the graves before he took a break; he ate his packed sandwich, an apple and a bottle of water to stay energized and ready to finish digging the holes. He looked on to see his progress and saw that he marked the grave locations and put crosses on the graves as a blessing.

Bryson would start to bury the bodies now, he moved and dragged the first few bodies to their graves and buried them. He wiped his sweat off his forehead and dug the shovel to the ground, "Man this is tiring...but again someone has to do it..." he sad as he moves the next few bodies. Hours would fly by as Bryson would finish half of the graves and preceed to my last break. Bryson took off his shirt revealing a toned body as he was exhausted from the manual labor.

"Almsot done..."he said finishind his last break and burying the rest of the bodies. It took him a day to complete, he would look at his work and clap his hands together and prayed. "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen."

He prayed over the bodies and began his trekk home. As he arrived hime he would flash his bible again and be let through the gates. "Sir Hassan, the task is complete" he said as he was still shirt less and sweating alot. I will go change and get ready for the day after I go to sleep for the night.* - Tue Oct 13 15:42:04 2015
