<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Genjutsu that stops all of your movement. - Sat Oct 17 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I have never been caught in a genjutsu so I have no idea myself - Sat Oct 17 05:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: What could possible happen when yuu are paralized?  - Sat Oct 17 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Death. If you're stabbed in the throat, it won't matter if the pain breaks the genjutsu. - Sat Oct 17 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You'll be dead. - Sat Oct 17 05:14:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Your nerves have to be stimulated constantly to break it. - Sat Oct 17 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Thats true enough I guess... is that the only thing your worried about? - Sat Oct 17 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Pain is 'one' way to do that. - Sat Oct 17 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Shunshin's another. - Sat Oct 17 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Shushin? - Sat Oct 17 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It stimulates the nerves. It's the jutsu I showed you for moving fast. - Sat Oct 17 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's called "Body Flicker." - Sat Oct 17 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It can make you run twice as fast or even several times faster depending on how slow you are 'without' chakra running through your system. - Sat Oct 17 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I see... so "body flicker" or "shushin" can allow you to move at fast speeds and break genjutsu? - Sat Oct 17 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The stimulating of your nerves can break genjutsu yes but the problem....is....... - Sat Oct 17 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you're in the genjutsu of a skilled enemy, then you're probably paralyzed and you may not even realize it. - Sat Oct 17 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So using shunshin is impossible in that case. - Sat Oct 17 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: So how do you avoid getting in a jutsu? - Sat Oct 17 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: a genjutsu? - Sat Oct 17 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Depends on the genjutsu. Genjutsu uses senses to get chakra into you. Once it's there, then. . . - Sat Oct 17 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The enemy uses your own chakra to fuel their jutsus. - Sat Oct 17 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Smell, sight, hearing. . .tasting. - Sat Oct 17 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe tasting I'm not sure. . . - Sat Oct 17 05:18:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you want to be immuned, the only way is to blind yourself in literally every way. - Sat Oct 17 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's why I hate genjutsu more than anything. - Sat Oct 17 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Also why I think the concept of the savant gene is autism incarnate. - Sat Oct 17 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Omit. - Sat Oct 17 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: So if you can counter it then you will be ok? - Sat Oct 17 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Counter it? By closing your eyes or something? - Sat Oct 17 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Like what determine the power of the genjutsu? - Sat Oct 17 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Enemy's chakra control. - Sat Oct 17 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And the genjutsu stat which isn't canon for the record. - Sat Oct 17 05:21:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: So how can you tell if your in  genjutsu? - Sat Oct 17 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You look for things that seem unlikely or otherwise off. - Sat Oct 17 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's easier than you'd think. - Sat Oct 17 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Extremely easy. - Sat Oct 17 05:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In that case you're probably screwed. - Sat Oct 17 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Other people? Not so clever. - Sat Oct 17 05:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- For a non-ninja, it may not be as easy for you. You may not know our limits as well as one of us do. - Sat Oct 17 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For a shinobi, we know what's normal and what's not because we've seen things. - Sat Oct 17 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just thinking about it irritates me. If a single genjutsu user was as good as I am with ideas they'd be pretty much unstoppable. - Sat Oct 17 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I see... so I am in trouble if I am not aware - Sat Oct 17 05:27:40 2015
