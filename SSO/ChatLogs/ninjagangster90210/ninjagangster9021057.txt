He had half a mind to erase her from exist right there but no... He had to calm himself as he had to act rationally. He clenched his bible tightly at his side.

"No.... I will not do such things... you have alot of... assests and use to give to the village." he said nonchalantly.* - Wed Dec  2 07:57:52 2015

I dont personally hate you but I cant stand what you are. You know what you all did and you cant be forgiven for it." she said in a calm manner holding his bible.

"I try my best to look past that darkness... that dark shadow of mana that flows in your body, but it hard. You anarchist are a plague to our society but I choose to ignore that even though I struggle with it. I have no idea how you feel about me; but my hate for necromancers are unrivaled." he continued as he would remain calm though the arguing.

"Say what you will but as you are alive right now proves that I have complete control of my emotions. You always have to test me dont you... push my buttons. Saying what you want and doing as you please, thats the great life if a necro isnt it? You have freedom to call me a sinner and evil just becasue I have have for your being... rational, justified hate."

"Bryson Lyan, a follow of the church; of the temple... I am simply do what I believe is right for this world nothing more nothing less"* - Wed Dec  2 08:20:03 2015

However, you are a necromancer down to your core and that isnt your fault. You were born into it so I cant fault you." she said with a stotic expression.

"Maybe things would be different if you werent what you are or i wasnt what I am but that is impossible now. Im sorry if that hate is projected on you, but it cant be helped. As I said im trying to get over it but its not something I will forget. You can do what ever you can for this village but it will not change what you are."

He would slowly shake his head and stare into her eyes, "You need a bit of a histiry lesson of you dont know aout the wars our factions faced" he said eyeing her slowly* - Wed Dec  2 08:49:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: What a hilarious world we live in.. - Wed Dec  2 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I guess so... - Wed Dec  2 09:30:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Even if I do think you're a bit young to think about those kinda things, it's nothing really wrong, mhrm. - Wed Dec  2 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Shinobi never cease to ammuze me... paying lera to dance... a maid cafe, what ever that is , and a swim suit contest, should be ammusing - Wed Dec  2 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: ...Well.. - Wed Dec  2 09:39:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: What kind of a killer am I, feeling sad about stupid things like that.. - Wed Dec  2 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Think about what kind- of things... Haha..hahaha.. You're so silly MItsunara. - Wed Dec  2 09:41:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Y'know, funnily enough, I didn't know that? But I'm not teasing or kidding. If you like me, I'm fine with that- personally, I don't favor either gender, really... beauty is beauty- but I've got a minimum age on people I'd date. - Wed Dec  2 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: So- yeah. I'm serious.  - Wed Dec  2 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: I should really start on that training... - Wed Dec  2 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Really...Oh! Oh... *she bites her lip* Well I mean... I just always saw you as a good friend. I didn't even think about you like that...but maybe if you really want to.. in two years... *she trails off* - Wed Dec  2 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: But training is so boring... - Wed Dec  2 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I mean. I've thought of you as a freind to, so.... It's whatever you know? If you wanan give that kinda thing a try- cool. We'll see where it goes and if feelings of /that/ kind happen. If you don't wanna give it a go? Don't. - Wed Dec  2 09:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Mrm. Yeah... and before you ask- no, it's not that you're not pretty. It's that I'd feel like a pedo or something, goin on a date with someone less than sixteen yearso ld. - Wed Dec  2 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I see... - Wed Dec  2 09:52:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: No... No I understand, don't worry about that. I really do. I'm.. just surprised theres another girl thats like me. And even if its in a few years, that she might want to date me. - Wed Dec  2 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: You are suprised by this after we earlier this day talked about how Lera and Kiyoko- also two girsl- are getting married? - Wed Dec  2 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Hah! Man.. you really can be clueless, sometimes... Mrm. - Wed Dec  2 09:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Oh no! I knew there were others like me, like you said Lera and Kiyoko. I just didn't think any of my friends would like people of the same gender, and then beyond that actually like me in return. I'm normally just...used to it being one sided. - Wed Dec  2 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Hah, I see... Mrm. Well- I mean. I think the way you tend to act is kinda cute, you're fun to fight, generally fun to spend time with.. I get along with you- and I like both genders, so... I mean, I figure if you turn out to have a crush on me, it'd be pretty smooth. I guess that's an odd sounding way to put it- but.. - Wed Dec  2 09:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: The way I see it, someone I know I can be freinds with, would be someone pretty safe to date? - Wed Dec  2 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Well... I mean I never look at my friends that way. Maybe this event thing has gone to my head a bit, but I really don't want to view my friends as merely crushes. Though- I think you're really beautiful, if you don't mind that coming from a younger person.  - Wed Dec  2 10:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I guess I see what you mean. Honestly, I'da never guessed you where into chicks if not for this whole thing... - Wed Dec  2 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: You also fun, nice to talk with, you have a really solid way with thoughts and words. I guess fun to fight you as well, though you seem to enjoy it a bit too much. *She softly elbows Mitsunara in the side* - Wed Dec  2 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Heh, it's whatever, I s'pose... Mrm. I guess I think of dating a bit over logically- but then.. - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I think of most things that aren't fighting a bit too logically.. and I think of fighting with almost no logic at all, bwahaha! - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Ahh.. Heh. - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Gah... You and Rias both said that, I thought it be obvious... Maybe I should wear a badge or something. - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: I don't think with much logic in either. Hehehe! - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I don't see how it's really that obvious until such time as you actually show attraction to a chick. How am I s'posed to guess someone's sexuality unti they do something to show it off? - Wed Dec  2 10:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Oh... I guess so... Hmm, ah that makes this all much harder. I have to be friends with people, as while subtly showing I'm attracted to them without making it seem thats the only reason I'm friends with them... Phhffaa! This is all really hard to think about. - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: And stuff like this? - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Is why I don't even try to be subtle about that kinda stuff. - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Too much hassle. - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Hmm... Sounds good... I guess I'll be more obvious about this stuff. I guess I'll test it on you first! I think you look really pretty in that kimono you always wear. - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I mean, more often than not, I won't be picking up on subtle signals from someone else... and I'm no good at i- - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Heh. Thanks- I agree, I look fabulous in this Kimono!~ - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Meanwhile, your outfit goes nicely with your hair, even if it is a bit suprisingly skimpy! - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I really like how the red contrasts the white, though, mhrm. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Yeah... Well, my dad raised me like a boy for most of time. So I just tended to train without a shirt, and well.... when I started growing these. My dad forced me to wear something, and well... I just don't normally feel comfortable in something like that. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Ah? Explains a lot... - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Heh, is that so... Sadly the only thing else I have to wear is this maid outfit. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: As if you really mind that much, heh. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Anyway... It's gettin pretty late.  Anyone know if anyone moved into Yan's house after he died..? If not, I'll probably move in- I was living with the guy anyway, and... I'm kinda homeless otherwise, so.. - Wed Dec  2 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well... Give me a second. - Wed Dec  2 10:11:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Hmm Hassans house is old but usable, Aza's house is free, and um you can...... stay with me if you want. - Wed Dec  2 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Rather not die in my sleep, no thanks. - Wed Dec  2 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Thank god - Wed Dec  2 10:15:15 2015
