<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) followed* - Sun Oct 18 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Would listen to her words carefully, honestly he felt honored that he was getting the privilage to be train by her and for her to train him an a supposibly powerful move as she says. "This will be our mark... our bond... I promise to never teach this to anyonw you have my word... I know your concern but I keep my promises, I will take this to my grave." he said in a stern voice also. He was standing straight and staring into her eyes. His eyes showed no sign or decit or malice... just genuine compassion and conviction.

"Im ready my Sister" she finished.* - Sun Oct 18 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Would watch her and learn by her movements and speech. Bryson was a natural genius by birth and it didnt take him long to get the hang of anything new but, this jutsu was a ninjutsu. It was about using chakra to stimulate his body. Surely as a medic he couls probuly do the same move using light mana and calling it something else, but it was something about Katsune that made him try hard. She made him want to do better, train better, learn faster and such.

He would form the tiger handseal and concentrate his chakra, mana or a combination of both through his body. He would send his mana/chakra throughout his body attempting to channel all he had hin his cells. He then tried to execute the jutsu, but he didnt move any where. He would concentrate even more, but he was more healing hisself than moving. "Well this is harder than it looks, but I can figure it out!" he said not wanting to let her down.

Its been several days meeting with the woman and he was once again trying his hardest not to let her down. It was no surpise he was interested in the girl but his interest level was a mystery. She had gauntlets from the Tenryuujoutei and he wanted to examine them but it would have to be at a later time. For now he focused on trying to master this move. So far he was yet to separate his chakra from his mana but soon that would change. 

Eventually he would figure out the small difference as he trained for days on end. He had a small about of chakra that was usable for everyday basic ninjutsu that he could use for simple things. He figured it out as he would send his mana and chakra into his body. It had a slightly different signature than his light chakra. It was either that or he could use his light chakra for miminal ninjutsu usage.

He didnt really care which it was... he only cared about completeing the training and jutsu he was givn to learn. However was that all there was to it? I mean day after day he was surrounded by men and women who were handsome and beautiful in their own right; but to be trained by a beautiful woman that took an interest in him and taugh him something so important and dangerous? It was an honor really. And Bryson was no souch either... he would wake up each day, preach at the church, ask for donations, then train with Katsune in their secret location. I was a tedious schedule but he wanted to keep it that way.

He slowly got better at dividing his charka but not telling her becasue he felt she would deem his progress too slow. He thought she was a woman of action and wit. And he was just a medic that could run ok. He was still interested in her past though; triying to execute the jutsu but think about her at the same time... Sometimes he thought of her capabilities emotionally. She never really smiled or frowned in the sightest... her expressions remained neutral. He would think about this the next couple of days as he mastered his chakra portioning eventually.

In the next few days he showed progress in his jutsu training. He would form the tiger seal and execute his jutsu speeding up the metabolism in his body to allow him to move at high speeds. He moved 3 feet from the left in his rush of speed. He felt pretty exausting from doing just a move and felt nausous. I dont feel so good he said slumped over and placing a hand on his mouth.

"Was... this ... the after effect of the jutsu?" he said trying not to throw up. It was truly a diliberating thing to experience although he should have seen this coming. As a doctor he should have come to a swift conclution that something along the lines of this would happen. I mean you were foring your body to move at abnormal levels and it couldnt handle this all at once. He would double over in illness as the training would conclude for the day he actually used the jutsu.

He would rest that night, proud of his accomplishment. He always thought abotu Katsune and her espression as they went through their training. She typically only showed one face during their training but he didnt mind. Passively she would grow on him, he gave her priotity over other during conversations and healing. She wouldnt care probuly but he didnt mind, it made him feel better in the inside.

On his tenth day of training he went by his routine and went back to katsune... his eyes meet her and he would prefrom the technique. He executed the handseal for tiger and concentrated his chakra into his system forcing it to speed up his cells. He would vanish...from his location and appear 10 feet from where it originally was. "I did it, it took a while for a low ranked move, but I have the ability to use Shushin."  he said with a smile on his face trying to hid the after effects of the jutsu. "Now that you offically taught me this jutsu... is our training over are... we done? Becasue to be perfectly honest I liked the time we spend together... It was enjoyable to me at least. You helped me alot" he smiled as the effects soon disapated.* - Sun Oct 18 04:24:06 2015

"So whats your poison today doc?" he said looking at the young ladies and the... monster. He looked at tetsumi with some discomfort... he no what he did. Bryson would see this and gve him a glare of his own... Bryson would look to defend the boy to the people around without saying a word. The bartender would swallow hard and think back at all his sins and appointment to the office. He would then on respond to Tetsumi kindly and with respect despite his past.

"I will have some classic all japanese sake... becasue its nice and generic...the finest you have please." he looked over at the others. "What are you all ordering?" he questioned as the bartender waited with pen and pad in hand * - Sun Oct 18 05:05:04 2015

The bartender came back with their drinks in a 5 star manner not talking about past events not thinking negatively about this patrons. He came with a smile, he brought out the bottle of sake... it was a typical size in typical cups. They had seperate cups but shared the same bottle. As for tetsumi, he was given a tall glass of water and Madelyn was given her tall glass of milk. 

"You enjoy you drinks and let me know is you have any problems" he said helping the rest of the customers. 

Bryson would pour himself a cup and off her a cup, Ai that is, "Here you go..." he looks  at everyone and says "To friends and to Sunagakure!" he said raising his cup and downing it... Pourimg himself another cup* - Sun Oct 18 05:55:24 2015

He had a high tolerance for the stuff so it would take him 2-3 bottles to get him drunk but he was a casual drinker. "You know, Ai the more I drink of this the more I think your actually a girl... I gotta examine you sometime... its strange how you were made by God ya no?" she said on his thirs cup of sake.

He looked at the position of the sun and thought. <I really have to call it a night. I have a early say tomorrow... its Sunday.> "Its not really about the taste brother ... its about the feeling?" * - Sun Oct 18 06:51:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: ...Should I stop letting people know I'm a murderer who enjoys spilling guts? - Sun Oct 18 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There are alot of evil people....The world is based around fighting and killing. I mean, as much as I want peace, I've killed and even vowed to kill certain men. Is it evil to kill?---In your opinion? - Sun Oct 18 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: omit - Sun Oct 18 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't believe in murder. All lives are valuable. I understand that people feel the need that they must kill, but my journey is to change the way people think. Too many people view themselves as tools, which is a reason why we fight for our lives. - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is murdering and killing the same thing? - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So to answer your question, I don't believe it to be 'evil' as evil is a relative word. There's no good or evil, just those with an open mind and those who refuse to think in a new way. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Taking the life of an individual is all the same. I've yet to take a life, and I hope that I don't have to. I've been told that such a day will happen, but I really wish one won't arise. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can't agree with you there. We both are looking for peace in the world though...I don't see it happening without certain people dying. - Sun Oct 18 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am willing to die in order to achieve peace..But I'm not here to die  without a fight. You will find a man one day that cannot be changed, and is destined to be killed or continue killing. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess mine is from personal experiences. But my brother was murdered in cold blood and so was my closest friend. - Sun Oct 18 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And those men who killed him are the men I have vowed to kill. They are everyting that is wrong with the ninja world. We have a few like that in the village and I wish to change them for the better...From my experience, it's more probable that I'll have to kill them. - Sun Oct 18 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. So your 'peace' is one where your loved ones don't die through the actions of other men? - Sun Oct 18 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess if you want to put it that way. I don't like to see people suffer and I do not like antagonism. When I see it, I want to kill it. If you let it grow, it becomes harder to kill...Kind of sick but it's true. - Sun Oct 18 07:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ah, a path of revenge..Revenge is akin to a flame. It burns anything and everything around you. However, lif used and directed properly, the flame can have pupose. - Sun Oct 18 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And I do have purpose. - Sun Oct 18 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm sure you do, but it's the flame of revenge that should be directed to a positive outlook.  - Sun Oct 18 07:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: This is the only outlook I see. It's what I've lived. - Sun Oct 18 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You'll see others eventually.  My only advice to you about revenge is, don't let it swallow you up. - Sun Oct 18 07:53:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But I work towards the betterment of my village now. If I ever get to take my revenge upon those men, I will..But I have a job here and I can't throw it away to fight battles. - Sun Oct 18 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. I suppose if I was brought up with a different point of view, I may have been the same.  To me, my ideal sense of peace is unity.  A world where everyone has reached a geniuine understanding of one and another, and are able to solve things through words and words a lone.  If I can even get an individual to see the world through such lens, it would make me happy. - Sun Oct 18 07:58:17 2015
