<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Kirigakure cought onto my plan. - Tue Oct 20 09:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And told me no. - Tue Oct 20 09:29:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Honestly I kind've did too, when you talked to the Hokage. - Tue Oct 20 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was surprised he even agreed. - Tue Oct 20 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He must've felt pressured. - Tue Oct 20 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Probably. - Tue Oct 20 09:30:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But yeah. Haven't asked about your jutsus because I don't have a use for knowing. - Tue Oct 20 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But you guys don't have any of those types of questions? - Tue Oct 20 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm interested. . . - Tue Oct 20 09:33:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Ask anything. - Tue Oct 20 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. What are your most impressive jutsus? - Tue Oct 20 09:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Define impressive? - Tue Oct 20 09:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Feats. Things most people wouldn't even stand a chance of mastering. - Tue Oct 20 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Mastering? - Tue Oct 20 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I should show you one of mine some day. - Tue Oct 20 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Maybe my genjutsu technique that makes everything dark. - Tue Oct 20 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: That's very tough to master. - Tue Oct 20 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Uhm.. - Tue Oct 20 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I guess impressive could be one of three... - Tue Oct 20 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: My Wind Armor takes ridiculous amounts of chakra and focuses them around my body at an insane rate that changes my body....My 2 finger Nukite takes all of the chakra that I would be using for Wind Armor and focuses it on just 2 fingers, it creates a blade so sharp I cut through Jiki's Iron Sand Armor and shield in one lunge and stil cut into his body. - Tue Oct 20 09:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sounds like you could've taken on Zetsumo alone. Then again, I never was skilled enough to test his strength that well. - Tue Oct 20 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But my greatest technique... - Tue Oct 20 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Well most impressive. - Tue Oct 20 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Is a technique I developed that uses my body as a medium and forms hundred of explosion tages made from my chakra, they all eplode at one, just before they explode they summon another to explode as well, it creates a never-ending massive explosion. - Tue Oct 20 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It could probably level a city. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And it's a forbidden jutsu. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fuuinjutsu? - Tue Oct 20 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: In short, its an explosion that keeps going until it kills the target. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Nope. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I never was good at fuuinjutsu. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Explosive tags are extremely weak though. - Tue Oct 20 09:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: They are made from my chakra. - Tue Oct 20 09:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Meaning one of these is enough to blow the shit out of most things. - Tue Oct 20 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I would show you...But I cant. - Tue Oct 20 09:46:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah. - Tue Oct 20 09:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Is it related? - Tue Oct 20 09:48:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But, he isn't lik me in that sense. - Tue Oct 20 09:49:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Aren't our type of shinobi only a discarded shell of the ones long ago? - Tue Oct 20 18:23:47 2015
