<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210)  handed her the the scrolls, it was a scroll on advanced sentence structure and bigger words. The scroll had compound words that involved locations and descriptive words. There would also be advanced words for showing pain or emotion as well as locations of the body. The next scroll was a picture of the human body; it provided words with a definitions and the translation of some of those words. 

Bryson worked closely with the Tenryuujoutei. They would slowly provide the appropriate translations to her speak and give him reference guides to make his own personized lessons for her. She was not aware of it but the lessons were as hard as they seemed to her becasue it was made for her. Bryson actually spend a great deal of time creating a lesson plan. It was tedious but it was all to help Makoto. They werent together, but they were very close... * - Tue Oct 27 05:00:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) was excited everytime he ws near her, like she gave him something else to work for. His work at the chuch and at the hospital was still there and busy but at the end of the day he waited for her to come back for another lesson. He loved her company. He would continue to guide her in her reading lesson, he rubbed her back on occation being cautious on last time. He would review with her each scroll and based on her scores he would move on to the next one. 

He would then state, "Now just becasue Im teaching you english I want to stress that I love and value your culture and language. Please dont lose your accent or language please... I love that about you Makoto." he said waiting to switch to the next scroll.* - Tue Oct 27 05:31:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) watched her range of emotions, it was cute. He would smile brightly at her, he was developing feelings for the woman but it was a process... much like teaching! The close bond they shared could stay the same or grow but who knows what will happen... Bryson lingered on the thought for a moment before snapping back to reality. He didnt notice that he was staring at her with tender eyes, he shook his head and went back to the lesson at hand.

She was glued to the scrolls so hopefully she didnt notice. He would move to more scrolls with alot more words, these words didnt have easy deffinitions on them. This was done on purpose so he could see her anazyles skills. The truth of it was the definitions WERE there but they were hidden in sentences that the words were wrapped in. She would have to learn context clues to learn them. Of course Bryson gave her tips and encouragement every now and then to keep her spirits.* - Tue Oct 27 05:55:50 2015
