<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) Walks off singing, "God id great, God is good, God is....~" he trailed off in the distance* - Fri Oct  2 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) walked to the Kazekage mansion with a broom in his hands and would look at the palace... "This place is huge... It will take a while to clean all of this...Lucky for me im blessed" he said sweeping away at the large steps one by one. He hummed some church songs while he swept the area. He started "Aaaaaaaamazing graaaace, how sweeeeet the souuuuuuuuund, that saaaaaaaaaved a wreeeeeeeeeeeeetch, like meeeeeeeeeeeee~ " he sang pretty well for a grown adult male. His voice was deep and mellow, it could carry a tone.

The wind was strong in Suna and sand was everywhere. The air in Suna was always carring sand in the air. As Bryson finished the first few steps the wind blow hard and covered the clean stairs with more sand. He sighed "Man this will be a hassle if this keeps happening." He would continue to desend down the stairs and sweep he was half way done.

He would continue to sing, "I hear the Savior say, Thy strength indeed is small; Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all. Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow." His muscles pushed the broom back and forth, pushing the buildt up sand off to the side and at the bottom steps. The wind came and pushed some of the sand back to the stairs but he continued down.

With the last of the sand swept up he would go back up the top steps and re sweep them. Ascending the steps and sweeping the little sand left to the steps... As he finished the sweeping he would walk back to hassan she slide him the success statement .* - Fri Oct  2 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) walked to the outpost, the villiagers and terrorist in the village would tell him to  hold up. He would hold up his hands as his coat swayed in the wind. "I have come in to help my children... My name is Bryson Lyan and im a messenger of god... I have come unarmed wanting to help your people..." he said with a smile. They would mull it over and two shinobi would check him... All they would  find is some holy water, a golden cross around his neck and his personal bible.

The would let him in and he would be asked to be lead to the injured villagers. They interrogated him before he could be lead any where. He told them about where he lived, his profession, and about his religion. Their interest was peaked... they asked if his faith was genunine and he would be offended. He would then stand up and repeat the entire first page of the Geneisis, the first page of the bible, the apologized to him alot and quickly took him to the injured villigers.

These people were angry... they were scared, they were afraid of change, they were planning to have a revolution. They told them under the impression that he would help their cause and he would. But he lived in the capital and thats where is support was. He would look over to the patients and flowed chakra through his hands; his hands would glow to a bright white as he would single handedly place his healing hands on every single patient there. This would rejuvinate all the cells in their body and as he spend time on more severe patients than others the technique would go deeper and heal the tissue of the organs inside if the patients.

After a while of healing, resting and more healing he would go to the center of the middle of the camp and recite his favorite scrpitutre, "Ezekiel 25:17. The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children." He said placing his hand on his chest. "Currently Hassan is that shepard and he will guide us through the darkness... Come my brothers and sisters... Help me bring Suna back into glory... We cant fight each other as this is the country we share!"

The audience rallied and the rebels were in awe of the Capital's cleric sermen... It was the thing they needed to put down their arms against the captial and the considered Bryson a prophet... He accepted this role and he gained a huge following in the outpost. He would slowly return to the capital of Suna to inform Hassan about his success in the outpost.* - Fri Oct  2 05:15:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) walks back to the square to see the family of Suna... He was smiling and walking with his bible in his hand cluched. His gold chain on his chest as his coat flowed in the wind. "Hassan, I have returned with good  news. The outpost has put down their arms against Suna and have pledged their support... Turns out they think im a prophet..." he said happily* - Fri Oct  2 05:20:25 2015

"1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

"Are you lost my child? I can guide you into the light of the lord" he said smiling* - Fri Oct  2 07:25:00 2015

"I do not know the reason for your expressions and such... maybe you need warming up to but everyone is entitled to their own religious beliefs.

He knew that they would need to bond if he would ever get used to her and vise versa but as the Lord was his shepard  he would guide Bryson unto Zenaki's heart and break her shell with his light. Her stare did not faze the medic, as he mearly smiled at her.

"I heard about Zetsumo, but he is in a better place now im sorry for your lose... The Lord has him now and hw will take good care him." he said as he would continue to make small talk and get to know her.* - Fri Oct  2 07:56:35 2015

He flowed chakra into his hand and reached his hands out. His hands glowed a bright white... "Here give me your hand... Let me show you..." he said waiting for her responce. From her stand point she would notice that the technique would not be the typical color of your basic healing technique. If she would allow him to heal her she would feel her cells being revitilized.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) would begin his shadowing of Zenaki, how ironic the words are... the Angel shadows the devil... but it was a nessecary. Under normal circumstances he would most likely go corrupt but he was strong in faith and even though he didnt like what she was doing he had to respect it. He would talk to her side, his tall physique overshadowing Fuji and Zenaki only by a a couple of inches.

As he went to her side she could see his bible was strapped to him.. it was a belt like strap that was wrapped around his waist. He is bible was in a hoilster on his side as he was reading  his medical book. He was initionally reading up on hte several organ systems of the body. He quickly read the about the circulatory system, digestive system, endocrine system, nervous system, immune system, lymphatic system, and the reproductive system. He was a natural born genius with photographic memory so he only needed to read it once before understand and compredending that they were for* - Fri Oct  2 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) //The god fearing man had followed the woman into the prisons, he looked at all the condemed of the forgotten. He could have ended up like these poor individuals but no he was saved. She disabled the prisoners with ease and it was intriguing... he would have to inquire about how she did that in time. She picked a few bodies and dragged them out side and to the hospital for operation or experimentation or what ever she wanted to do and watched closely. "I can carry them for you if you like?" he said being sincere. The lord would wash him for his sins later when he repented. He would simply be the assistent for now.* - Fri Oct  2 16:38:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) Bryson watched as he began her...brutal style of teaching was... unsettling to put it lightly. As he cut him open and told him to check the goings on in his body he would hear her warning... "I wont heal him if thats what you wish" he said forming a cross in the air and reciting "My the Lord have mercy on your soul..."

Frorm this stand point he would use the knowledge from the book and the body in his view to have confirmations. "So this  is the chest cavity of a living human, most complicated but easy to remember. the heart and lungs, covered by the rib cage, the bones of skeletal system; the heart of the circulatiry system; all working in a fast manner becasue of the pain..." he said examinating the body. He would lightly graze the bones and organs getting a feel for the density and strength of the organs. "You know you could have induceda coma to prevent all of this suffering" he said looking at her to see the reaction of him screaming in agonizing pain... 'Does it get her off or something?' he would think to hisself

His hands were red brom blood but he didnt mind, He was a man of god but he was also fearless, "Ok we can continue... go right ahead" he uttered standing over the man.* - Fri Oct  2 17:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) //To say this woman was sick and depraved with -STILL- be a understatement. If anyone loved blood and gory and pain as much as she did then they would be a perfect couple . Bryson was in affected by the bloodfy and torturing scene. As medical christan he had seen scenes to horrible to repeat and this was just another page in that book. He would look over to see what she was doing to the other guy, restraining him and injecting him with needles in him. Was she into BDSM was another question out of hundreds he had. The red eyed beauty of a devil urged him to explore the terratory of the human body.

He would look back at the screaming human, 'this screaming is so annoyign but if she likes i will have to deal with it...' As she explained in minor detail about her fetish, he would nod his head in responce, "Very well you are giving me the honor of being my teacher so I can be picky..." he said in his deep booming voice. He would get a closer look at the body doing a full examination of the inner workings of the human body. He would notice the lagre and small intestine moving them around ever so slightly to get a feel for them and look around them. passing his eyes over to his stomach and liver... feeling his kidneys, even feeling the inside and outside of his skin for thickness and shape.

As he stopped for a second he rose and looked her up and down gazing at her womanly features, "Zenaki, I have come to realize you didnt bring any female bandits with you. Female bodies are slightly different than male bodies so wouldnt I need to examine them too?" he questioned.* - Fri Oct  2 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) After the body of the first died, he would get more messy with his search. He pushed organs around and removed them from the body until there was nothign left. The gall blatter, the colon, the spleen, the pancreus, and the brain... All were removed from the body. He removed all organs and cut his body completely open... exposing all layers of skin and bone... She asked him a question and he would turn around with blood soaked hands, "What?"

Was given a choice... his first choice... was she testing him? Was she bored with her toy... or was she just curious. As the last man died slowly and painfully; he assumed the other should suffer as well? "Well I have learned alot so far and I still need to work on the female body, so why dont we... break his bones and examine him..." he would say and look at her and see her reaction. He was still over dicecting the other body clean.* - Fri Oct  2 18:44:16 2015
