<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Would pat Koji on the shoulder and run to catch up to Paine, He moved rather fast for a Priest... But he would still need time to catch her. "Sister Paine... a moment please" he yelled while running* - Mon Oct 12 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) [switched back to the Kronos color for memories sake] Bryson would again try to approach her. He would reach out to her and check her for the curse. "You see alright... how are you feeling?" he said until he let her go to talk to her peronally. "First...Im sorry for the whole random love confession a while back... the truth is Susumu is a necromancer and he deals with curses... He cursed me to fall in love with you and I couldnt control my emotions. Of course everyone calls you stunning everyday even though you do nothing to show it." he said matching her emerald stare with his sapphaire stare.

"I would advise you not associate with him as he could do the same to him and force you to do things that you dont want to do. I care for you and I dont like seeing people being taken advantage of..." he would sound genuinely worried about her even though she could handle herself. "You should stop him before he finishes any talking..." he finished looking at the woman. He had a interest in the woman... but he didnt understand why... was it the fact that she respected religion and could recite religious texts? What ever the case it would not hinder his case.* - Mon Oct 12 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) nodded "Thank you Paine, also if you in need of medical help Iam here along with a few more medics that just came in; but Zenaki and I are the top ones at the moment." He stopped; and it would feel like he was meta gaming but he felt this had to be said. Bryson would say once more "Necromancers curses affect everyone; but being as I am a priest I cant negate the affects of the curse but it is less severe on me as then it would be to you... As I was rised as a priest my opionion is jaded becasue I was raised to hate them but I believe that to be true as he used his curses upon everal people whether he cared or not."

He finished talking to her but he couldnt help but sense nervousness from the girl... he would say before he finished this topic. "If you would like to spar... im not very good becasue dont focus on fighting... but i will try..." he said * - Mon Oct 12 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Remember what I said... Paine... - Mon Oct 12 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Before I leave your presence is there something you need to tell me? - Mon Oct 12 02:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) tapped her on the shoulder and headed toward the hospital... he wanted to rp with her more but he had nothing to say* - Mon Oct 12 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Tetsumi... Are you alright my brother? - Mon Oct 12 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Would come out of the hospitsl door for a minute and lean against the door.  "You know as a doctor and as a precher I am sworn to secrecy...If you ever need to talk im here for you." he said looking up to the sky hearing rumors about him "I cant understand your past and I wont try to understand if but I will say the Lord forgives." He then closed his eyes and recited his favorite quote.

"Ezekiel 25:17. The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. I believe this line suits you to a T my brother..."  he said * - Mon Oct 12 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) said "If you need it I will be here for you" he smiled as he thought Tetsumi wasnt a bad guy... he was just misunderstood. He has been through so much in life that he was overwhelming him. "I will do what ever i can to help you my brother..." then he took to a darker tone of voice. "Watch out for Susumo... He is a necromancer... I felt it when we walked close no another... The use curses that makes people go against their will... watch yourself and makes sure you stop and "low mumbling" he may do in your vision..."* - Mon Oct 12 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) continued "As a priest I can sence Nercomancer in my area... as well as the curses they inflict so im the only defence against them" he said to the man. "Well it ws nice talking to you.. just call for me when you need me brother..."
he said befroe heading back in the hospital* - Mon Oct 12 04:22:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) said "Good, now lets head to the hospital ok ladies?"  he said as Zenaki and Bryson headed to their usual location in the hosptital area with Paine in tow. The doctors or nurses usually let them pass as hey had high level authority in the hospital since they were field medics...As they went in the elevator to their private room it looked more up to date than usual... All the room was more advanced and the chairs in the office was comfortable... "Zenaki, I havea budget with the ranks so I decided to upgrade and add a few things... we also have a office on the top floor" he said in a normaal tone.

He turned to Paine, "Is this your first time in a doctors office?" he wondered* - Mon Oct 12 15:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Would put a few things in order... sign doccuments and grab some books and such. "Paine you can come in if you want... Im moving soon anyway we are going to out private practice room. for the lesson. Also are you nervous? I am interested in learning about that technique you use that changes your hair... I am also in the process of studing the female body."  he said waking to the room where he wouls be larning with Zenaki. Zenaki just stood there making sure he didnt fuck up anywhere. The entered the room and there was a few chairs... some examination tables, alot of medcial devices and a comfortable paitents bed.

"Paine would you be comfortable with me examining you? This is completely optional... you can say no" he wanted to stress that.* - Mon Oct 12 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) would smile at her and state, "Very good and dont worry I wouldnt want to hurt your beautiful skin, now... I will give you these to change into, first im going to do a full body examination then I will check your pulse, your vitals, height, weight, etc.." he said handing her open back patients clothing, "You can chang there or in that room there... your preferance... I will be getting ready." he said pointing to the changing room in the corner.

Bryson would place his bible in his hoister and cover it in his doctors coat. he would wash his hands in warm sopy water and dry them... he waiting for her to get ready. Paine looked stunning as usual; so was Zenaki... in retrospect there were no ugly women in this ninja world.. He was surrounded by them and he couldnt help but smile. Now when it came to actually dating someone he was more of a failure than anyone.. People hit on people everyday but he would jut fail at it... this was more of a personal thought for him. He was thinking while waiting...* - Mon Oct 12 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) would comment, "Well I can see why you have so many suitors" he chuckled as he said a lame doctors joke. "But anyway, can you lie on you back for me, we are going to start the examination; if you are ever uncomfortable please let me know ok?" he said waiting for her to respond. "I will tell you what im going to do then I will preform the action... First Im going to feel you body from you feet to your head, I will be feeling for veins, your skin and skeletal structure." he said touching her toes with his pointer finger. This was just a test to see how she would react to him touching her at all.* - Mon Oct 12 16:38:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) would start my moving up her legs slowly uding different forms of pressure on her legs and moving to her thigh, he used boths hands on each leg coving most of the area . He checked her mucles and veins while feeling her... as well as the structure on her bones. He would recite some words under his breath while feeling and gripping her legs, "Fibula... tibia... patella...femur; along this side would be the Tibial venis, the popliteal vein, the femoral vein..."

He would notice amy abnormalities on her body... if he did not sense anthing hw would feel sliky soft skin and well toned muscle, "Quardriceps femris, iliopsas, sartorius... hamstrings and i ha- i might to avoid the gluteus maximus and the vaginal area for now... I dont wanna over step my boundries" he said just loud enough for anyone close to hear. He would repeat the same thing with the other leg before moving to feel her hips and pelvis on their sides. If allowed to do all of this he would  say back in his normal tone, "Ok now I will move to your upper body but im avoiding your chest is that alright?" * - Mon Oct 12 17:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) expected this much to happen, he made sure to avoid her sensitive areas," I can feel your responses... dont worry your in good hands... I would never do anything to make you uncomfortable, you have grown on me in the past days...Im almost done... with your front side at least.." he said while continuing the examination. He stared to do the same with her torse moving slowly up her ribcage. As he got to the bottom of her chest he would move to her arms... first the right arm then her left arm.

Upon in expection on her stomach, he would either feel the definition of her abs or the toned muscle of them. He would been inspected her rib cage, pushing against any bones he felt and moving down and away when she got nervous as he got near her chest... "I wont go there so dont tense up... also your sternum is there so we will just leave that untouched" he would have said; he couldnt check her sternum so he would ignore it for now. Her arms were like the rest of her body toned and such as he began the examination of her arms.

"Humerus... radius... Ulna...shoulder blade" she mubbled checking her wrists and her hands to the tips of her fingers. "Biceps, tricepts, deltoid" he said going up her other arm. Then he went to her neck and her head he would make sure not to use too much pressure on her skull and move her hair around to finish the exam.

He would stand straight back and say, "Ok all I need is o check your back and we are done...unless you are uncomfortable..." he wait for her response.* - Mon Oct 12 18:01:36 2015
