<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Was bored so he thought of an idea... He wrote a letter to the Tenryuujoutei again requesting for another weapon made. This time it was a bow that would have special properties and of course enhance priest abilities. He would pen to them his additional good deeds. 

He identified another person of interest who was corrupted by a necromancer and her last know locaation. He also informed them of his continued healing of the village he inhabited and his recruitment of two more priest to his faction. He mentioned the continued team work with the Hokuma family... even going to such lenghts to be considered part of their family. He mentioned their trait in the letter and a vague descrition of what it did.

Lastly a update on all the necros he knew; Mitsunara... Osuda... and even Zenaki becasue of her new upgraded aura. Hopefully this would give him a new rank in the Tenryuujoutei through all of the good deeds he had been preforming. He then sent the letter off to the temple.* - Fri Dec 11 23:45:00 2015
