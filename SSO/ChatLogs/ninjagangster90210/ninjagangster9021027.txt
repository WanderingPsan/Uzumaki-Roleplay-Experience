<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Would slide her a organized sentence scroll. The scroll had various simple sentences in it, it focused on how to start and make sentences in different ways. He would point out several important functions in sentences and using certain words to convey different meanings. He then slowly inserted more words  into the scroll these words were descriptive words... adjectives. He would check up on her by asking her a few questions, "Do you understand so far? Let me know when your ready to stop... We can alternate from this mental learning to physical training" he said trying to make her understand what those words mean. 

For physical training he would punch the air and for mental training he would point at his head. All the while his right hand would be used for pointing at words and gestures while talking. He left hand was placed on her shoulder and moved to her back. He was providing support and tlc while she was learning to boost her morale. Learning a new language was hard and tedious... he was proud of her* - Sun Oct 25 02:30:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Watched her as she learned, her progress was impressive the time line of the learning and training was about a week. "You doing alot better dear" he said rubbing her back. 

<In a comical anime fashion he relaxes his hand for a moment and his hand rested on her lower back.>

He didnt notice this nor did he think about it when he preformed this action, he went back to teaching. "Ok so lets make a simple sentence in review. I will start..." he said starting to make a sentence. "My name is Bryson and I like to read." he when waited for her to form a sentence.. His facial expression was one that showed interest and excitement in helping it was a small smile. * - Sun Oct 25 03:02:36 2015
