<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (so omit sharingan and just pretend red eyes) - Mon Oct 19 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (he said that?) - Mon Oct 19 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (this shit was like in july, my memory ain't 100% clear. i don't remember if he said that oocly or icly. . . should probably just omit what i relating copy wheel and just pretend i said red eyes and nothing related to copying) - Mon Oct 19 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (so we ain't told we meta) - Mon Oct 19 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (im j/s if u meta and i use the info u icly give me im in trouble too) - Mon Oct 19 14:11:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Why do you want his eyes? - Mon Oct 19 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: And why does Shin? - Mon Oct 19 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Well . . . Shin said he's a blood relative to Ushinawa . . . And Ushinawa had those red eyes . . . He has potential. - Mon Oct 19 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: As for the eyes . . . I noticed something . . . They increase your reflex by a hand-ful . . . I'm lacking in that and I could use it . . . Other than that , Don't know much about them. - Mon Oct 19 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Hideki had to use them to react to my jutsu. - Mon Oct 19 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (how in the world do you ICly know they improve reflexes?) - Mon Oct 19 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (i wouldn't care if not for the fact you're ICly telling me these things) - Mon Oct 19 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (Cause I noticed that hideki needed to use them to react to my stuff at all) - Mon Oct 19 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (sharingan stealing metagame is the most uncool metagame in the entire world) - Mon Oct 19 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (I might not know how much specifically . . . But I do know your reflexes do increase at all) - Mon Oct 19 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (And we both know) - Mon Oct 19 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (that could be legit but what if he's using the eyes to see what nature your jutsus are) - Mon Oct 19 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (or to determine whether or not it's genjutsu) - Mon Oct 19 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (That they can atleast knock someone out . . . ) - Mon Oct 19 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (u wouldn't ICly know) - Mon Oct 19 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (As for the jutsu . . . I would probably need a lot of time to realize he's copying my jutsu) - Mon Oct 19 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (He didn't copy anything during the spar though then) - Mon Oct 19 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: It's obvious the eyes do "something." They have to turn red for a reason. - Mon Oct 19 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Anyway . . . Yeah, Reflexes. I could perhaps try and steal some info on them. - Mon Oct 19 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: What I want is to know what they do exactly. Not wild guesses either. - Mon Oct 19 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I want facts. Proven facts. - Mon Oct 19 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Is knocking out Beth just with them a proven fact? - Mon Oct 19 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Ushinawa seemed to maybe use them as the trigger for his genjutsu. Any part of the body can be used as the trigger though if you develop the jutsu specifically with that body part in mind. . . . - Mon Oct 19 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I wonder what the genjutsu is to knock someone out. - Mon Oct 19 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Anyway you said you can get information. How? - Mon Oct 19 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: But yeah . . . Shin might not have them but since he said he's done a bit of digging up in his family line . . . I might ask him for information. - Mon Oct 19 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Hideki said he's going to attack anyone who isn't in the family who uses Sharingan . . . I might just ask him why it's so important to not let it fall into the wrong hands . . . Wouldn't be too reliable info though if he catches on. - Mon Oct 19 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (red eyes*) - Mon Oct 19 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (i have sharingan engraved in my mind that using red eyes instead is hard) - Mon Oct 19 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Why....in the world.... - Mon Oct 19 14:22:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (omit that then) - Mon Oct 19 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yo Shin. - Mon Oct 19 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We gotta talk again. - Mon Oct 19 14:24:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I wasn't hiding anything. - Mon Oct 19 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: If those eyes have ties to genjutsu I'll go so far as to tell the entire god damned world about it. - Mon Oct 19 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Genjutsu is an abomination and I'll make sure that anything so petty is made common -knowledge-. - Mon Oct 19 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: Really? Well I guess we are the same in that reguard so necromancers - Mon Oct 19 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'd rather you 'pretend' you didn't hear that conversation though. - Mon Oct 19 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: If "copywheel" users found out about my -campaign-. . . . - Mon Oct 19 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'd have to start checking my food for poison. - Mon Oct 19 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: I wouldnt want anything happening to you so your secret is safe with me... doctor , patient confidentiality... - Mon Oct 19 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: On the other hand some of the things Kilm was saying....... - Mon Oct 19 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Suggest it might be even more dangerous for the world to know what those eyes do. - Mon Oct 19 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I suggest keeping quiet about them in general. - Mon Oct 19 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: I work with the white eyes, their eyes are special too. So I know a special eye when I see one - Mon Oct 19 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: "White" eyes. . .? - Mon Oct 19 14:32:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I don't know if that's good or bad - Mon Oct 19 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Does that mean you're normally bad? - Mon Oct 19 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Or are you just extra good today? - Mon Oct 19 14:38:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Same here - Mon Oct 19 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I could go for some work - Mon Oct 19 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: But I can't ask anyone for work, because Im not a member of this village - Mon Oct 19 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Haven't changed ever so i'm still the calm and relaxed guy that I am. - Mon Oct 19 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: I guess its a story for another time - Mon Oct 19 14:39:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Kilm... - Mon Oct 19 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah? - Mon Oct 19 15:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Nothing important - Mon Oct 19 16:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: I assume if she really wants or needs to know she will bring it up again - Mon Oct 19 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I should really train. . . - Mon Oct 19 16:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But how do you train jutsus that aren't worth anything. - Mon Oct 19 16:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Are they useful? - Mon Oct 19 16:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not at all. - Mon Oct 19 16:08:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Well you can spar with them or test durability - Mon Oct 19 16:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So hard to find good sparring partners these days. - Mon Oct 19 16:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Eirther my jutsus would kill the person or. . . - Mon Oct 19 16:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Or you could teach someone else the technique. - Mon Oct 19 16:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Their jutsus would kill me. - Mon Oct 19 16:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Mon Oct 19 16:10:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Well cant you tone down the power of the jutsu...they can vary in strength right? - Mon Oct 19 16:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Saeza, how are you?  - Mon Oct 19 16:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah but blocking is an important part of combat too. Canceling out an enemy's jutsu with a stronger jutsu, if you're not fast enough to just dodge. - Mon Oct 19 16:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So if you hold back on jutsu strength, the spar isn't worth as much. - Mon Oct 19 16:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Hi there. I'm fine. - Mon Oct 19 16:11:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Never really seen her there before, but he was kind to all so it didnt matter. His deep voice boomed to her, "Alright when ever you are done with Brother Izutora we can leave" he said standing by her and waiting* - Mon Oct 19 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Hmph! - Mon Oct 19 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Called a carvaan for them to get there faster. As their ride got to their location he hopped in and he extended his hand from inside the caravan so she could get in. This trip would not be a quick one as it took a while to get to there. "Well while we are on the way let me formally introduce myself, Im Bryson Lyan,  local priest and medic its a pleasure to meet you." Bryson would extend his hand in friendship seeing another medic in Suna.* - Mon Oct 19 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Would entertain her questions, "Im a preacher, a born christain monk from the Tenryuujoutei. And Im also a medic, im not a shinobi so I dont use much chakra but mana which is sinilar to chakra. My mana is basically light chakra that I manifest to use with my techniques."  she stated pointing to his fancy looking bible. "We might not be able to do it all in one sitting or even one day but we will get it done in time. He just have to rest up and start again when we regain our chakra." He said looking in her eyes with a smile.* - Mon Oct 19 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) As the made it to the village the got out the caravan and Bryson paided the driver as it set off again.  The two were walking side by side as they talked, she asked him a question about teaching but he sadly shook his head. "I sorry my dear I wish I could teach you but these techniques can only be learned by priests..." he said placing his hand on her shoulder. "You cant learn the techniques that I know you have to know how to wield light as a weapon and tool." 

As they continued to walk in the direction of the hospital asking the guards and villagers about its location.* - Tue Oct 20 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) shook his head and stopped their movements. He walked in front of her and stared in her eyes... "It doesnt work like that my dear..." he said with a somber tone. "You have to be born in priesthood you cant just deicide to be one..." he would said then try to cheer her up. "But I am learn all the skills of a medic so I could teach you those ok? We can learn poisons, pills, and even sugery" she smiled.

He looked at the hospital building they were going to, "Err, lets go inside shall we dear? We need to check the statuses  of the patients... I hope you will be alright." he after her responces* - Tue Oct 20 00:33:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) //
As he entered the area he asked for the run down of the patients. He asked for the list of the patients and their illnesses. After giving it a once over he passed the list to Zephira for her to look at, "I need you to mark off the more serious illnesses so we can deal with those first. Priotritize the dying... keep everyone alive." Bryson would get his chakra flowing in preparation for the healing but it wasnt all about chakra. Some things  were out of his power, "Its like a birth right... you have to be born into priesthood; for example if we had a child and I decided that I would want him to grow im manifesting his light chakra he would have to be sent to the Tenryuujoutei for special training. But doing that will prevent him from using chakra." he tried to explain after she was done with her job.* - Tue Oct 20 00:47:21 2015
