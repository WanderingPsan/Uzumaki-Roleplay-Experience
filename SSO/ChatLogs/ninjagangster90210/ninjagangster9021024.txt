<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Would look through all his information. He mostly went over all the body systems to get a detailed description of them . The circulatory system moves blood, nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hormones, around the body. It consists of the heart, blood, blood vessels, arteries and veins. "My clensing jutsu only works in this system." he commented.

Next was the digestive system which consisted of a series of connected organs that together, allow the body to break down and absorb food, and remove waste. It includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. The liver and pancreas also play a role in the digestive system because they produce digestive juices. "I have to focus in the tongue to watch this area." he said

The endocrine system is next and it consisted of eight major glands that secrete hormones into the blood. These hormones, in turn, travel to different tissues and regulate various bodily functions, such as metabolism, growth and sexual function. "I dont really need this one but its good to know." Bryson commented.

The immune system is the body's defense against bacteria, viruses and other pathogens that may be harmful. But this was just something Bryson knew didnt need his help with. As a doctor you should be aware of every function of the body. As if something happens then he would continue to read.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Lymphatic system played a role in the body's defenses. Its main job is to make is to make and move lymph, a clear fluid that contains white blood cells, which help the body fight infection. The lymphatic system also removes excess lymph fluid from bodily tissues, and returns it to the blood. This was another system that was optional but needed.

The nervous system controls both voluntary action (like conscious movement) and involuntary actions (like breathing), and sends signals to different parts of the body. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of nerves that connect every other part of the body to the central nervous system. He thought <The most important of the body... the most protected... I need to really watch this if I check a patient>

The body's muscular system consists of about 650 muscles that aid in movement, blood flow and other bodily functions. There are three types of muscle: skeletal muscle which is connected to bone and helps with voluntary movement, smooth muscle which is found inside organs and helps to move substances through organs, and cardiac muscle which is found in the heart and helps pump blood. He circled this area and thought, <Jutsu, Jutsu... >

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) The reproductive system allows humans to reproduce. The male reproductive system includes the penis and the testes, which produce sperm. The female reproductive system consists of the vagina, the uterus and the ovaries, which produce eggs. ... "Pregnancies is something that I will have to deal with... I need to deliver the babiies"

Our bodies are supported by the skeletal system, which consists of 206 bones that are connected by tendons, ligaments and cartilage. The skeleton not only helps us move, but it's also involved in the production of blood cells and the storage of calcium. The teeth are also part of the skeletal system, but they aren't considered bones. He circled this definition in the book as he had a jutsu idea for it he had to work on.

The system that involves the lungs allows us to take in vital oxygen and expel carbon dioxide in a process we call breathing. It consists mainly of the trachea, the diaphragm and the lungs. Now this is what I need to remember... this is one of the important systems.

The urinary system helps eliminate a waste product called urea from the body, which is produced when certain foods are broken down. The whole system includes two kidneys, two ureters, the bladder, two sphincter muscles and the urethra. Urine produced by the kidneys travels down the ureters to the bladder, and exits the body through the urethra. "I hope no one get problems with this..." he said going down the list.

Integumentary system is the body's largest organ. It was the skin on your body, most people didnt know it was a organ. It protects us from the outside world, and is our first defense against bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. Our skin also helps regulate body temperature and eliminate waste through perspiration. Hair and nails were also part of this system.* - Fri Oct 23 01:38:59 2015
