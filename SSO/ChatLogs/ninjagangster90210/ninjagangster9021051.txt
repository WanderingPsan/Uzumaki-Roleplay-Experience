He loves all his children so he cant help when you 'need' it becasue that would show favoritism." He was starting to get angry with the hethens disrespectiong his God like that. "He has the power to heal all injures and sicknesses; he created the heavens and the earth... he created all life on the planet. He is an amazing and awesome GOD." he said as his eep voice echoed on the area.

"It pure disrespect to compare a man, more or less a anarchist to God. If God intervened in human interactions Edge would cease to exist when he even thought about my lord" he finished. "There is only one time when he wanted to restart his world. He called for a great flood in which the Heavens rained for 40 days and 40 nights. It flooded the world becasue there was too much evil in it. I have told you he only intervenes when there is need of a rebalance in the world." Bryson was highly pissed at this point.

"My sweet ignorant brothers and sisters, Satan was a fallen angel who rebelled against God. He was depicted as a demon but he wasnt one."

"Satan was cast out of Heaven, having "great anger" and waging war against "those who obey God's commandments". Ultimately, Satan will be thrown into the lake of fire by God himself. God has no rival... its best to remember that" he stated* - Mon Nov 23 15:05:48 2015
