<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) went to the top floor of his office. He closes the door and walks to his desk sitting down and opening his book on his desk. It was a book on the homan body. on the side of the book rested a lazer pointer becasue Sunagakure was rich as fuck like that. He stared att he empty desk make for Zenaki but she never came to it... He would sigh deeply, he had not seen Zenaki in a while and when he did see her she was with beth or Fuji. He felt like his anatomy training was incomplete and he had to finish it himself.

He then thought about all he did so far. He examined a live human body in Paine but not fully. He examined male cadavers and live males that dead from Zenaki's hands but never from a complete viewing of both genders. He would have to relay on his skills reading wise to finish his skills. He would look at the book then use the lazer pointer to match what he learned to the spot on the body model. It was a simple process and simple learning so it wasnt hard.

He mapped out the circulatory system, the digestive system, the endocrine system, the lyphastic system, the nervous system, muscular system, the reproductive system, the skeletal system, the urinary system, and the integumentary system. each system was important to the body as a whole. He also remembered the main organs in the human body. The brain, heart, kidneys, the iver and the lungs. He point out the the parts of the body and rest f the day. He would make his way back to the squard becasue he was bored and lazy... H didnt want to do much* - Wed Oct 21 07:37:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Bryson started to read from his anatomy book. He read up on the vital parts of the human body. He read the passage, "Humans have five vital organs that are essential for survival. These are the brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs. The human brain is the body's control center, receiving and sending signals to other organs through the nervous system and through secreted hormones. It is responsible for our thoughts, feelings, memory storage and general perception of the world. The human heart is a responsible for pumping blood throughout our body." he said reading out loud.

He continued to read out loud, "The job of the kidneys is to remove waste and extra fluid from the blood. The kidneys take urea out of the blood and combine it with water and other substances to make urine. The liver has many functions, including detoxifying of harmful chemicals, breakdown of drugs, filtering of blood, secretion of bile and production of blood-clotting proteins.The lungs are responsible for removing oxygen from the air we breathe and transferring it to our blood where it can be sent to our cells. The lungs also remove carbon dioxide, which we exhale." he stopped to exhale a bit. "All this information helps me out since i mostly did all the physical trials."* - Thu Oct 22 05:06:46 2015
