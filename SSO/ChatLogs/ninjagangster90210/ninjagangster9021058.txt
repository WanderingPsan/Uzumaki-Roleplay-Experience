"Lera, I an allow you to take the bill I will either pay it all or pay half" he said with a smile. The priest was loaded... his robes cost 2 mill and his book cost one mill; it was obvious he looked like he had cash to spare.

The plate was brought out to him, it was a hot steaming juicy steak on his place. Maybe Chikyu would be reminded of Rias's display at the hungry ant?

Anyway he would pour himself a cup sake and he would automaticly refill it when it was almost empty. He also cut into the managable pieces and would take a bite every now and again until it was gone during the conversation. He ate polietly and neat not spilling anything and keeping his self clean during the dinner* - Thu Dec  3 19:07:18 2015
