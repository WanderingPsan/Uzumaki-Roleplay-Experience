How ever Koji was also a good cantidate. At the mere age of 13 he was the "Eyes of Hassan", a clan leader, he was very wise for his age, and he had a sense of justice.  Bryson was inciated into the Hokuma's as a member of their family also.

He knew both of them. He trusted both of them but he had a choice to make... "Well this is a tough decision but if I had to choose I would have to say... Koji. No offence to my old friend of course.
