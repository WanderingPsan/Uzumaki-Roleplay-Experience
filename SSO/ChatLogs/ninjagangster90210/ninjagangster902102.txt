<br><font color=teal>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) says: "Come here." He'd mumble under his breath, pulling on the chains which were connected to the kunais. <<< what is life RN - Mon Sep 14 10:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) was no match for his speed in any account, in the back of his mind he cursed God for not blessing him with the power he needed to edge out a win of some sort... ot at least run away

All his actions would go through because he wasnt reflexive enough and he had a only one arm to work with so his balance was off. "Fucking Niza" he cursed under his breath... as he was grabbed and kneed in the skull. His hand was already fucked so pain coursed through his body as she was thrown in the air. As he was dazed from the pain and the headshot he suddenly felt sharp pain in his body. 

Two pierced his body and he had no way to dodge... or did he? He thought about what he could do to escape form this faith... 

He could not form hand seals, he didnt master his technique yet, and he was a step slower and weaker than the assassin...then Boom!

He was slammed on the ground... a scream of pain was heard in the courtyard of the leaf village. He would try to ask him one moe question. "W-Who s-sent y-y-you..." was all the kid could muster...* - Mon Sep 14 11:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mancer, Keyshawn(Ninjagangster90210) //"..." he didnt say anything... He want sure if his was telling the truth or not but  that didnt matter. Niza seemed to be the culprit; Did Niza always show this  hatred toward him? Why did Niza do this now of all ties? Did he just want to cause him pain? He already took his hand and he wanted his life next?

This questions circled around him in his head as he laid there waiting for the final strike. Hatred would start to stem from his being. The hatred from his soul would be forced upon his incarnation.... the hatred of Niza... the hatred of Jashin... it was a path that would end for one and begin got another... 

He didnt see much in his life, he was only 10 years old. He saw a glipse of ultimate and evil. He saw a instance of hatred and merliless fury. As he closed his eyes into a unconsious body, his head was ripped off his body, with the force of T2 strenght... If they didnt have enough power to do so then sliting his throat would be the next best thing.

Keyshawns only regret? Not unlocking the power hidden deep within him* - Mon Sep 14 11:45:04 2015
