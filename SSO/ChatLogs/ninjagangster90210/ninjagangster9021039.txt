<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Weird that he said that then. - Mon Nov  9 13:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He is very good at lying. - Mon Nov  9 13:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Makes me wonder what else he has lied about. - Mon Nov  9 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh...Sanoke seems to have this idea that I can do everything. - Mon Nov  9 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its not the first time he's said something like that. - Mon Nov  9 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see. - Mon Nov  9 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He must look up to you quite a bit. - Mon Nov  9 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Haha, nah. I've never beaten him once. - Mon Nov  9 13:49:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I have been trying to decide if I should learn how to fight, and if so what type of fighting I should learn. - Mon Nov  9 13:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? And your thoughts so far? - Mon Nov  9 13:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well, you offered to teach me, I think? If I remember right. Marrisa offered to teach me. Sanoke, sort of did? He was trying to help me pick something and suggested small throwing weaponry. It sounded boring. I realized I do not want to do genjutsu for sure. That is the only thing I am certain of. - Mon Nov  9 13:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No genjutsu? Alright. Has anything piqued your interest at all? - Mon Nov  9 13:55:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Which are? - Mon Nov  9 14:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Firstly, learning from you. Secondly, apparently wind element is very strong? So I guess something doing with that. Thirdly, ....there was something. I forgot. - Mon Nov  9 14:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: That smile...so curious. - Mon Nov  9 14:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nothing~ Whats the third thing? - Mon Nov  9 14:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I honestly can't recall. - Mon Nov  9 14:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Maybe it was, I would like to do something that is for protection of others also, but I guess considered shinobi? Apparently it's very...weird of me to not know how to fight. - Mon Nov  9 14:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright..uhm... - Mon Nov  9 14:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You say learn from me, but what specifically? I may not know everything but I do know a lot. - Mon Nov  9 14:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well I suppose I'd have to ask what it is you know other than swords. Course swordsmanship doesn't sound all that bad, it's on my list of posibilities. - Mon Nov  9 14:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright uh... - Mon Nov  9 14:08:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....all of them?? - Mon Nov  9 14:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh huh - Mon Nov  9 14:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Holy hell woman. - Mon Nov  9 14:09:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well then... - Mon Nov  9 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What does summoning do? - Mon Nov  9 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I am so not built for taijutsu. - Mon Nov  9 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: At least I don't think so. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You contract yourself to an animal and you can summon them at will. Theres a huge range, going from rats to dragons. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....dragons... - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Those aren't real. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: However, once you've signed a contract... - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh they are. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I once...knew someone who could summon them. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The previous owner of my blade... - Mon Nov  9 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...weird... - Mon Nov  9 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The summoning scroll unfortunately...was lost. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They're amazing creatures, I got to see a full adult dragon up close. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What is it you summon? - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I summon wolves. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: often sniff out trouble before it hits you - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Saved my ass a few times...gotta admit. - Mon Nov  9 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm...interesting. - Mon Nov  9 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If you're interested you can sign my scroll. Or you can try and find your own. - Mon Nov  9 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I've very uncertain about all of this. - Mon Nov  9 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm....I'm not sure...I can see two things really. - Mon Nov  9 14:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? - Mon Nov  9 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can see you using swordsmanship, but not like me. I'd see your style as being more delicate, finer in approach. Unlike mine which is more brute force. - Mon Nov  9 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And I can also see you fighting from a distance. - Mon Nov  9 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Perhaps with ninjutsu, or perhaps with weaponry. - Mon Nov  9 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In the end though, the choice falls to you. Nobody can tell you what you want to do. - Mon Nov  9 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm. - Mon Nov  9 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, there is chakra flow. - Mon Nov  9 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But other than that...I don't really know of any element specific weapons...or at least...well..actually no thats a lie. There is one...the only one of its kind. - Mon Nov  9 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But can you use the Raiton element? - Mon Nov  9 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No no...wind. - Mon Nov  9 14:23:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A sword? - Mon Nov  9 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Is that possible? - Mon Nov  9 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. Hm...Just need to find someone who can teach you basic swordsmanship - Mon Nov  9 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And yeah, its tecnically possible with any object. - Mon Nov  9 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: As long as you have the chakra to do so. - Mon Nov  9 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh. - Mon Nov  9 14:25:42 2015
