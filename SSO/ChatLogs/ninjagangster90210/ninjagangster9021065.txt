<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I really need work on my ability to move around the battle field - Sat Dec 12 23:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) would nod and start some training of his own. He wanted to be able to glide across the battle field to help heal people when needed. He would try out free running, the ability to adjust your running style so accound for your terrain. He would get into racing stance and bring his head down. A mental count down played in his head. then in a flash he woud bolt to the wall.

He would zig zag from left to right cutting in the sand and trying not to lose his footing. He would then stop on a dime and look at the wall. He would bend his legs and jump on the wall. Latching on the wall he would grab some footholds and make some hand holds by punching away some rocks. He would jump from one spot to another... it required a great deal os athletism to preform this act but his body was trained and he was doable but it was extremely exausting for him to preform.

 He would finally make it to the top of the wall and look down at them... He was sweating and he took off his robes to reveal a extremely well toned body. It was odd to see for a priest... Sweat rippled from his forehead and down his chest. He would wipe sweat from his forehead and watch as more people enter the arena* - Sun Dec 13 00:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: You know why. - Sun Dec 13 01:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) Would run down the mountain after he got a breather... He would rush straight down the wall and increase his speed as he begins to blur to the human eye. He would race down to the side of the mountian almost at the bottom of the wall he would jump off the wall. Jettioning his self foward and sliding across the sand. He would then do a couple of somersaults and back flips to react the other wall.

He never stopped moving as he was working off the consept of not being slowed down by anything in his path. Byson was remained serious as he would bring his training to a completetion. He finished by final stretch by running alongside the wall and then by keeping up his speed and jumping in an inclince she woul slightly run on the wall but it was not a complete transition as of yet. He would stop in front of His priest group and collapse on the ground reathing hard... "I think that enough of that for now..."  she said still breathing heavy.* - Sun Dec 13 01:08:12 2015
