<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) would walk to every house and knock on the doors on the citizens of Suna. He started to move to the houses and the  "This area is not safe, please evacuate your homes and you will be safe." He said going from door to door saying the same message. It was simple to just shushin to every door and repeat the message. He had no idea how yelling would work during all this mayhem but he tried that too.

"Everyone this is not a drill! Danger is imminent! Calmly walk from your homes and move to the designated safe place. The designated safe areas as the stadium, the barracks, the plaza or the hospital." he said with his deep booming voice that echoed in the area. He had strong lungs being a preacher and yelling all day. The people were alittle worried about what was happening but Bryson would calm them down with his words.

"Everything is under control everyone, Sir Hassan and our elite shinobi are handeling the situation... nothing to fear" He boomed on the area. Along witht he help of the 10,000 guards around the village that some people forgot about He would lead them to the several locations. Guarding them from the still loose prisoners, the guards would quickly handle any escaping prisoners and restrain them while the others continued the protection.

He went through most of the residents at this point and mainly focusing on the business owners becasue they didnt want to leave their businiesses closed. "You will come back to your businesses when it is over please follow the rest of the citizens to the safe areas please," he said with authority. He would see that noone was on the streets after several hours of relocation from their houses or places of employment. Bryson flickered all over the village to make sure noone was left out of the safe areas. Sunagakure was a big place and it would take him even more hours to search every nook and cranny for a human body that was alive.

Bryson made surehe didnt miss a single soul. He made sure that wveryone was accounted for. He went to each safe area and looked around to check the capacity for each location. He also senses all the evil and good that was in every location, on a side note it was very mixed. Finally he would take Makoto and take her home. She was with him during all this time as a guard but was never referenced until now... *Kanye shrug*. He took her home and placed her in bed. "You did a good job today... now you can rest." he said yawning also.
"Today is Sunday, I have a sermon in a few hours; Im sure they will be fine without me. I will heal tomorrow" he said getting in bed with her and going to sleep.* - Sun Nov  1 08:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Training time is so close...meh... I really don't want to learn these last jutsus. They don't have much use while I have a sword. - Mon Nov  2 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, I used a sword in my earlier days, but I realized that I didn't need one. - Mon Nov  2 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: My ninjutsu is what i need to focus on. - Mon Nov  2 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: My dad says that one just needs to focus on what their heart tells them too! If one wishes and trains properly, you can be strong in many ways! - Mon Nov  2 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Cool beans. - Mon Nov  2 21:32:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Some people have various reasons for doing what they do. Some selfish and some selfless. Some don't even have enough purpose to have a ninja way....which I don't understand but it is what it is. - Mon Nov  2 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What are you guys talking about? - Mon Nov  2 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Just reasons to becoming a ninja and what makes one drive to be stronger. - Mon Nov  2 21:49:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It's okay. Are you a genin too? - Mon Nov  2 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm usually the paper pusher of the village though so I don't get out on missions often. - Mon Nov  2 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Uh, well, I am a chunin. - Mon Nov  2 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I never had the opportunity to take the chunin examinations though. I was promoted during wartime. - Mon Nov  2 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Ohh, does that mean you're strong?~ - Mon Nov  2 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Eh, it means I've been around. - Mon Nov  2 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So you're weak? Haha. - Mon Nov  2 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It's okay, I am too. But I don't care anymore. - Mon Nov  2 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, I guess I'd be bias in saying that I am strong. Few have beaten me. - Mon Nov  2 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I could count them on one hand. - Mon Nov  2 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You should care about your strength as a ninja, though. What sort of technique styles do you use? - Mon Nov  2 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Maybe I could help you a little. - Mon Nov  2 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I use everything. I'm a generalist. - Mon Nov  2 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: And I used to care, but I've come to realize that I can't save everybody. - Mon Nov  2 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So.... - Mon Nov  2 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well... - Mon Nov  2 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That just means you should try to get stronger. - Mon Nov  2 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I couldn't save my best friend or my brother. They are both dead because I wasn't there to protect them. Now I've devoted my life to becoming stronger so that no one else will be killed needlessly. - Mon Nov  2 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I suppose so, but even if you get stronger, you can't stop everyone. - Mon Nov  2 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And that's why you have an entire village to help you. Many of us who settled back into Sand have worked tirelessly to create a safe enviroment...We are the most stable village in the entire world at the moment. - Mon Nov  2 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That way you can train to become strong...same for me and everyone else here. - Mon Nov  2 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I see. - Mon Nov  2 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh, well, I just got back from a long walk home..Uh, I mostly just train...*cough* I try to stay busy with my ninja duties.  - Mon Nov  2 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It doesn't leave much room for hanging out and leisure time. - Mon Nov  2 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I could train with you and maybe critique you, if you'd like. Otherwise Trilliam is someone you'd probably liket o go hang out with. He's a fun guy. - Mon Nov  2 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, you could train me if you'd like, but I'd rather have a friend to hang out with too. - Mon Nov  2 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) thinks: Such a gathering. They look strong.. I wonder how smart they are! - Mon Nov  2 22:04:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: In fact, I wouldn't mind both of you sparring me. - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its quite rude to try and use training, as an excuse to break a conversation! - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm not that strong but I can try to hold up against two ninja. - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: How about three? - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
