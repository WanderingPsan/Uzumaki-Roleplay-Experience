<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Certain jutsu mind transfer techniques leave my body immbilized and defensless.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: omit jutsu)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: immobilized()
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (*)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I see...Guess I'll have to protect you...But I have a useful little jutsu myself...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Oh? And what's that?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Temporary Paralysis Technique...It completely restricts the enemies movements.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Hmmm.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Trapping the opponent first would be good for my jutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Then while you attack, I will switch back to my body.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmmmhm.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: And interrogation on the target can begin.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (God forbid the Hokage sends us on a missions to kill someone, cuz they will be owned xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (I wanna be ANBU now X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (IKR)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Heh, well I'ld sure hate for you to be in my mind~
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Heh, and why is that?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Because, you wouldn't want to know what goes through my mind~
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Well, I can't read your mind. I can only control my opponent once my mind is in their body.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Heh, I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: So yeah. The whole point of this division is to gather any useful information that would be vital to the village. 
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Sometimes the Hokage will send us on special information gathering missions.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: So be ready for those.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Right right....
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Well.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: That is all for now I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: You have been keeping a close eye on the chunnin exams right?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yes.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Good. Nothing unusual or any suspicious people lurking around right? Usually people tend to take advantage of the chunnin exam as an oppurtunity to attack.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: It's always safe to be on gaurd.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: There was a small scuffle between the Amekage and a man in a black robe with red clouds on it...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Hmmm.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Did you witness this?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yes, they tried to fight on the Chunin grounds...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I see...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: What was the man's intentions?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: If you know.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I have no idea...I assumed at the time they had some transgretion with each other...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Hmmm.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I need to have a little talk with the Amekage then.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Someone probably wants him dead.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Either that, or it's just a missing nin wanting to cause trouble.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I guess....Sigh...So what do you do for fun?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Well...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Alot of things.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I enjoy eating ramen. I own the flower shop near the hospital, and I take care and train my younger sister Clayr.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Once she becomes a chunnin, she will also be jounin the Intelligence Division.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: joining()
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Hm...I see....
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (* lol)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Anything else?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Nah.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Not really.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Lame...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Welp.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmm, you need to learn to live a little.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I know how to live.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I have fun in my own ways.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Now then.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I'ma go outside for soem fresh air.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: some*)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Oh.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Sup.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Hmmm?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Ah, hello.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I was about to buy some shuriken.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Are you a Genin?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I am a chunnin.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Ah, phew.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (your from konoha too lol)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I was scared that you'd be a Genin from another village that's angry about not being in the Chuunin Finals.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: If you're a Chuunin, then please tell me. Are the Finals scary?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Heh.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Yes they are.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: . . . 
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: You will be facing some of the best genin out there.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Oh god I'm done for.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Don't worry.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: All you need is confidence.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Confidence? How can I have confidence with only the basics of the basics and one jutsu?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I've seen one of the others fight.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: She will slice me up.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: A shinobi's strength isn't determined by how many jutsu he has.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: It is measured by his ability to not give up.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Well, I would just feel more confident if I had something special, something that they didn't know about.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: What jutsu do you have?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: The Genin already know what I can do, and what I cannot. They must be making strategies right now on how to counter me.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Water Style : Raging Waves. . . 
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Oh, I see.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Well then.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Here.
<br><font color=yellow>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) gives him a scroll labeled, 'Water Style: Syrup Capture Feild.'*

<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( xD )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( I would feel so much epicer with Third Affinity : Katon. Then if I did become Toad Sage I'd be able to do Toad Oil Flame Bullet, once I'm like A rank xD )
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (XD)
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) took hold of the scroll and blinked a few times. '' Thank you, you're a kind Shinobi. '' , he smiled gently at her and opened the scroll.*
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: This jutsu isn't much. But it will help you a bunch if you opponent is caught with it.

<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I'm guessing you are clan leader of the Hyuuga clan?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (??)

<br><font color=yellow>*Akimichi, Takumo(Infinite Swag) was going home with his father after learning the Human Boulder jutsu, feeling a bit starved. He started to think of his father's food. The plate filled with cooked pork, chicken... Another plate of spaghetti, and a lot of soda. The brainstorm was so big that he started to feel the smell of the food. The anxiousity was enormous, making his stomach growl. His father looked at it for a second, with a grin on his face, then looked forward again.

Takumo began to remember about his childhood. He was pretty dedicated at school, but never had a mother, since he died when he was born. His father was always there when the academy classes were finished, and always asked all Takumo got skill and grade-wise. His father never had a lot of complication, though, since Takumo was the smartest person of the class. Takumo kicked a rock and almost fell for a second, but recovered the balance, and continued his brainstorming.

The hard days of training he had to learn ninjutsu and taijutsu. Even in the cold weather, he was there, with his father, training how to become stronger on his kekkei genkai. Takumo trained taijutsu secretly, since he wanted to be different and common at the same time. The kid was able to mix both strenght and ninjutsu effect, making his fatass clan jutsus stronger.

The cold breeze passed by Takumo's clothing. The kid stopped brainstorm, and was now concentrated on the surrounding. It was winter in that day. The trees were frozen, the ground seemed a little tricky. The sun was hidden behind the cold clouds. A black flash passed in front of him with incredible speed, as his father put his left hand in front of Takumo's body, blocking the way.

His father's eyebrows were narrowed. Something was awkward there. A concealed figure appeared in front of them, with black torn robes. He grabbed a kunai from his pouch, and put it in front of his body, showing a stance and a murderous intention. That was the great time for Takumo to shine.

The kid channalized chakra through his whole body, stuffing mass-wise. His arms and legs were retracted, expelling chakra. The ball formed kid started to spin with incredible speed. His hair turned into spikes, increasing the effectiveness of the attack. He rolled towards the concealed figure to try to stop him quickly. When he got closer, his father appeared in front of him using the same jutsu. They hit eachother, knocking back.

As Takumo's father motioned to make him leave, the concealed figure, being a skilled figure, threw the kunai aiming at Takumo's father's back. As soon as Takumo started to run away, and his father turned to the concealed figure's side, the evil man started to perform a severies of handseals. Looking back while running, Takumo was trying to be aware of what was happening. When the guy stopped performing the handseals, the kunai multiplied itself, leaving no time of response to Takumo's father.

The scene was horrible. Takumo's only friend, was now... dropped dead. Tears started to drip from his eyes, showing the desperation. Takumo quickly changed his way, heading to the concealed figure. He grabbed four shuriken, and threw them at the guy's direction. When the concealed figure was busy trying to avoid them, the kid, filled with anger, channalize chakra through his body again, turning into his ball-like mode. He rolled towards the guy, and used a rock to jump on the air, and landed on top of him. His spiky hair started to cut the guy apart, turning his flesh into pure blood.

Turning back to normal, he fell next to his father's corpse, staring deeply at his blank eyes. Tears started to drip again, turning instantly into frozen liquid before hitting the ground.*
