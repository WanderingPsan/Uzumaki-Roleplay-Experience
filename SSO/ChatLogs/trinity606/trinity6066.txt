<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Oh....
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) depressed look on his face.*

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Alrighty...Let me see how you both fight in hand to hand combat.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Alright..
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: *sigh*
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: I forgot)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: What it is )
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: The name of the symbol you make when u friendly spar)
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) gets into her boxing stance that she doesn't feel like fully rping.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Bitch just spar.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) would slowly ball his fist, as he would attempt to dash forward. Breathing in and out, As he looked at Dawn. As he would attempt to stop before her once close enough, he would clench his fist tighter lunging at her shoulder. Cause he knew he should never hit a girl in the face, even if she was an enemy. That was just his way of doing things.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) was in her boxing stance, which held her arms close to her face. She simply used her right arm to block his punch while still clenching her fist, however she did not counter. Instead she took one step back and continued to analyze his movements, waiting for an opening.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) would quickly follow up with a right kick attempting to hit Dawn on her Hip, Though he was simply trying to figure out her strategy for Defense. He was also trying to find a good opening. Furthermore *Evan's suggest*, he would attempt to keep his body a smaller target. Though he knew it was nearly immpossible with the attack he was trying to perform.*
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: LLOL)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Key rolled Sex Addict, and Tri Force)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: lol)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Har har)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (wtf)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Nympho)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: and Fire, Water Lightning)
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) simply lifted up her left knee in order to negate Dusken's kick to her mid section, a simple MMA tactic to defend that region. With the recoil of the kick, she decided to finally go in for an attack, brining her her right knee towards Dusken's stomach right after putting up her left knee to negate his kick. She still kept her hands up to gaurd while performing her actions, exhaling with every strike to make sure no stamina is watsed.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) would quickly feel the knee comming up to his stomach, knowing it was no time to be a wimp. He attempted to grab the knee, on its way back. If succeeded, He would attempt to drive her backwards. And knock her to the ground, if succeeded, which it most likely wasn't.  Dusk would hold his fist over her face, though he breathed in and out. He wondered if he was thinking to far ahead of himself.*
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Trace uses the Medical Scan, it tells them:

<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Demons live longer than Kaios)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: wdf?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) felt her knee come into contact with Duksen's stomach, however she also felt both his hands come into contact with her knee. With both of her free hands, she was not about to allow that to happen, as she simply extended her right hand out towards his face in the form of a right handed cross, exhaling as she threw her punch. If hit, she would take a few steps back and get right back into her stance.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) would get hit in the face, falling back from the force. As he quickly attempted to regain his balance. Standing, he would let out a slight chuckle. Before balling his fist once more, he would stare at Dawn. Ready to be on the defensive.*
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Dawn gun break my jaw)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: :D)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (lolno and brb)

<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (anyway brb...)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (back)
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) kept her stance up, placing her hands up for her arms to gaurd her face and and leaning her body down a bit to gaurd her mid section. Her right foot was placed behind her with the heel slightly raised for balance and mobility, with her left foot placed infont of her. She hopped on her toes and awaited for Dusk to make his move, she was rarely the first one to strike.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) just stands there waiting for her to attack.*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (i didnt even see dat small ass rp
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (until now)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (X.x I had to check his logs for it lol.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) doesnt attack and instead begins to shuffle over to his side, still holding back an a strike until Dusk makes a move. *
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: One of you attack...Please.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Hand to hand ....right?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yes...
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: *sigh*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) would slowly inhale then exhale, clenching his fist once more. As he turned facing Dawn, dashing forward Dusken would attempt to once again kick Dawn on her hip. If blocked or not he then would attempt to follow up with a right punch to her Stomach if he saw an opening.*
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: <_<)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (turning  ooc off =.=)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Si)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: C'mon kids...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (rping)
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) braced herself as Dusken came towards her, her eye caught site of his kick once again. Again she help up her left knee in order to block the kick to her hip, and seeing that it would take time to perform a punch right after a kick, she used that little time to counter herself, brining up her right leg and attempting to kick Dusk in his rib cage as he prepared to throw his punch.*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (i just realized)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (my character is always boxing and kickboxing.)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (but i never chose the perks to make them better)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (They cause more damage to themselves then their enemey does lol.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) would get kicked once again, falling to the ground. He was done, this was not his specialty and something he needed to practice on more.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Alright, good show you two~
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) walked over to him and held out her hand to help him up.*

<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [No, I'm just racist.]
<br><font color=yellow>*Kurina(Punkamainia) would arrive at Amegakure, panting a little. "Wow. We're finally here." Kurina would drop her bag for a few seconds, sitting down to regain some strength. Kurina then stood up, re-equipping her stuff.*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (wait gotta fix something)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (ok fixed)
<br><font color=yellow>*Kurina(Punkamainia) would arrive at Amegakure, panting a little. "Wow. We're finally here." Kurina would drop her bag for a few seconds, sitting down to regain some strength. Kurina then stood up, re-equipping her stuff. (Repost.)*
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Welcome to Amegakure.
<br><font color=yellow>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) wiped off the beads of sweat from his face and placed the small towel he used back into his Ninja pouch. "So, this is it, hm?" he'd say as he followed Kurina through the Village. "Hopefully there will be others."*
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: You... look familiar, Sir.

<br><font color=yellow>*Kurina(Punkamainia) would look at the people arriving now. Kurina,arriving exactly a few minutes ago would bow, "Hello."*
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Dead hopefully.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: I mean.

<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: The taijutsu?
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) has an embarrassed face now..*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Alright...
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: I saw a secluded place....

<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: You know how to throw punches right?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: And kicks?
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Y-yes...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Well.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: OH!
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Idea...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I can teach yo-
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: What.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: I can incorperate my Genjutsu into my Taijutsu!
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I doubt that would be possible.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I was going to teach you some Muy Thai.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Muy Thai?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Yes, the use of knees and elbows.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Alright...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Now.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Do you know the basic stance?
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: No....
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: It's just a regular-
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: It's just the basic boxing stance.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Oh then yes...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Alright.
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) walks closer.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) gets into his Novice Stance. With some errors.*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Now as I have done before.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: If you are flexible enough, your knees should help gaurd you from mid range attacks.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: By brining your knee up, you can block a kick  to your mid section or a punch.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Also.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Your stance.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Raise your right heel a little.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: For balance.
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) does a stance demonstration.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) would slowly raise his heel slightly, getting into the same stance Dawn was.*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Good.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Now.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I am going to perform a right kick slowly.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I want you to bring your left knee up as I kick.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: OOOO! Can I show what I meant?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Incorporating Genjutsu?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I'm pretty sure genjutsu require hand seals. It would be difficult to do that while fighting close range.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Im not sure how long it lasts :D)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Cuz I make the seal den touch u)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: I don't know how long the period in between is)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (i would see you doing the seals)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Or if its til I touch someone)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Ik.)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: But If I did nothing)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: you'd think it was a kawa)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: den I touch u)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: :D)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (touching me =/= do anything)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (wtf is that)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Lyzerg gewtsu)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (lawl)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: I got made Lyzerg last night remember?)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: I just didn't want the name q_q)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (nigga den put it in yoru last name)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (fine)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: :D)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: But how long is the period inbetween)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: on a guess)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (idfk)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (ask Wyn)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: All I know is)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: with ym perk the time is boosted to 30 secs)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: lol)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: all that was said)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Anyway, Maybe another time.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Lets try this..
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: What are you going to do....
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Block you...
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Remember?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Oh right.
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) runs up to him while still in her stance. She brings her right leg up and twists her body to perfom a right leg kick towards Dusken's hip.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) would attempt to raise his leg to his knee, but not fast enough getting kicked in the hip.*
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Raise his knee*)
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) lowered her leg to try again, this time doing it much slower to give Dusken some reaction time to bring his knee up to block.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) would quickly raise his knee as the kick came his way. If succeeded he would've blocked the kick*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Let's go back.
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: Hello there.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Go on off toward the training fields.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (best combo)

<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: And welcome back.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: But what if you can save the world?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: What...
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Nevermind..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Alright...Which one of you can tell me about chakra control?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I can.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Like walking on water right?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: In depth what is it.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: I'll let Dawn explain I have the next one.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Chakra control is what is necesarry to perform the ninja arts. Certain techniques require more chakra control than others, and vice versa. The amount of chakra control a person has determins what kind of jutsu they are able to perform and how well they are able to do it.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Good job.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Now...Who here can actually use chakra control?
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Not me.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Me neither.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Kiye rolled)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: o-o)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: We've only had basic academy leaf training.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Boil)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Q_Q)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Leaf concentration training that it.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: is*)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmm, well today you will learn how to use chakra control...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Alright.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I want you both to stand ontop of the fence behind me, once done you will both force your chakra to your feet hold the chakra and then walk up the mountain.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Rps?
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: _
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (3)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Alright.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Can you give a demonstration please?
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Yeah what she said
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and walked over toward the fence, reaching up he threw himself ontop of the metal and maintained his balance. Clapping his hands together he said "Watch my feet.." a few mere moments passed until a blue hue enveloped the soles of his sandles, after he slowly began to walk along the mountain until he was horizontal, looking up he stared at the two and said "As you practice this will progressively get easier until you notice no drain and are able to control your chakra subconsciously."*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Alright.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (rping)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Okay.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: ^same)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Btw)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: tell the hokages Shunshin/Sui isn't basic)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Kages*)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (^)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Mah OOC is off X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (ill do it
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmmm, I really need a vacation...Sigh..
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) watched her sensei climbed the mountain using nothing but his chakra control alone, a feat that seemed impossible to a regular person. Dawn walked up to the fence and climbed the metal gate, using her balance to stay on the gate for as long as possible. She closed her eye and began focusing on her chakra, trying to get a good feel of it, however she was unable to. She assumed that the small spark of feeling she felt was her chakra, but it was really just her stomach growling since she was hungry. She took one small step on the mountain and immediatly came crashing down to the ground below, hurting her arm a little from the impact. She knew not what she did wrong, scratching her head and remembering that Evan's feet had illuminated with the glow of blue chakra, something that Dawn had overlooked herself.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Word to the wise...Too much chakra and you'll blow a hole in the rock..To little and you don't stick, you have to find the perfect amount~
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmmm, I'll be right back keep training~
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) got up from her fall and brushed her shoulders off, shrugging off the pain from her fall and getting up to try again. Climbing ontop of the gate, she began to focus once more, trying to feel the chakra inside of her body. Once she felt the small spark of chakra, she began to try and move it to the soles of her feet, concentrating as hard as she could. Out from the soles of her feet, the blue mist of chakra began to materialize and appear on the bottom of her right foot, but not her left. She did not have enough control to focus on both feet at once. She placed her right foot on the mountain and noticed that it was slightly sticking, forcing her body upwards onto the mountain wall. Once she did this, she began focusing on her left foot, which still didn't have any chakra flowing through it. It proved to be quit difficult for her, and so she broke concentration and fell to the ground again, this time making sure she landed on her feet not to hurt herself. She figured she was somewhat getting the hang of it, she just needed to focus on both feet at one time.
*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Baaaack~
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (on my third rp)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (You both done it yet?
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Ditto)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: on my third)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Once you both are done I have some news~
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) would watch Evan as he stood upon the gate, watching him channel his chakra into his feet. Followed by him standing upon the gate, Dusk would crack his knuckles. Slowly approaching the gate, as he chuckled. Placing one hand on the gate, pulling himself up. As he looked at the mountain, focusing his chakra into his feet. Furthermore, Dusk hoped to reach his goal to reach the level of Jounin. As he looked at the moutain , leaping into the air he attempted to place a single foot on the moutain testing its stability. As he attempted to place his other foot on it, as he simply fell back on the gate. Followed by hitting the ground.

Dusk would slowly get up dusting himself off as he listened to Evan's words"Word to the wise...Too much chakra and you'll blow a hole in the rock..To little and you don't stick, you have to find the perfect amount." As he closed his eyes, inhaling then exhaling. As he once again leaped to the top of the gate, reopening his eyes. He stared at the gate with a fierce determination, placing his foot on the mountain. Then concentrating his chakra into his foot, he attempted to regulate it so it moved with the moutain. In the case a pebble fell it wouldn't throw off his balance. As he placed his second foot on the wall, instantly he fell backwards. His first foot hanging on to the wall as a suction cup of some sort. Sighing, he released the chakra from his foot, falling the the ground head first.

Would once again, dust himself off slamming his palms into the dirt he said to himself"I must do this..." As he sighed, balling his fist standing back up again. Closing his eyes he placed his hand on his chest,  concentrating on regulating his chakra. Followed by regulating his breathing, As he would place his hand on the gate. Lifting himself up onto the gate, he would stand channeling his chakra into his feet. He would place his first foot onto the mountain, Regulating the chakra in the sole of his foot to the movements of the mountains. As he placed his other foot onto the mountain. Standing back he looked at Evan, Smiling he said"I got it!" Moving further up the mountain, he would release his chakra doing a flip in mid air, he would land on the ground. IN a kneeling stance wondering if Dawn has also completed the training. Which he realised she was done before him.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) took a deep breath and she began an attempt at her third try, fully confident that she would get it this time. She looked over to Dusken to see how he was doing before continuing to finish her own try. She closed her eyes for a third and final time, focusing the chakra that was within her body. Now that she had tried a few times, she figured it would be fairly easy to get it down. Climbing ontop of the gate once more, she allowed the chakra to take form under the soles of her feet, finally getting a good balance and being able to do both feet at once. She took one small step onto the mountain wall, a bit nervous about her attempt. She completely shrugged off her sensei's words at the moment and continued to concentrate as hard as she could, placing one foot on the wall and making  it stick. Once she first foot was up on the wall, she placed the second foot, hoping she wouldn't fall back down to the ground. The balance of chakra being sent to her feet matched the ruggedness and roughness of the wall with each step, allowing her to walk onto the wall freely and without falling. Since she did not have that much chakra control, she jumped from the wall and landed back down to the ground, looking to Dusken to see how he was doing.*

<br><font color=green>*Hattori(Skarrj) says: Hi dawn.]
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (hi)
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: ((Haider.))
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (hi)
<br><font color=yellow>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) 's eyes widened as he finally analyzed the situation he was in. His fellow squad member and best friend began to gush out in blood falling backwards. Before he hit the floor, a thump of an unknown source seemed to resonate against the hard ground. As the blood splashed across the battleground, and eventually cleared, it was evident that his partner had just lost his right arm. Although gore no longer affected the Medical ninja Souretsu, his mouth slightly gaped. In a slight spike of anger, he tightened his fist, looking to the swordsman ninja who did such a thing to his friend. Souretsu's eyes met with the man's, as a sly smile frayed across his lips. Souretsu gritted his teeth as he leaped forward, in vain, as the swordsman retreated and vanished rather quickly. Almost as if to mock Souretsu, the swordsman seemed to have whipped his blade as he escaped, leaving a peculiar sign to Souretsu. He noticed a strange green splash of liquid near where the man once stood, and saw smoke start to sizzle through the ground. Souretsu looked back at his squad mate, realizing what was happening as he noticed a distinct smell in the air, the smell that burned through his friend's arm, and the ground. It was a rather rare poison, called Huntsman's Bile, something that could kill a man within a few hours if left untreated, and something that was native to this very area. The string of possibilities of how a swordsman would know such a thing, and be able to create a poison to line his own blade went through Souretsu's mind, but his friends screams pierced all thoughts. He ran to his friend, looking down at his cut arm as green bubbles slowly formed across the red gore of what used to be his arm. Souretsu thought for a moment, and looked around; forming hand seals as he also made sure the area was safe. He lowered his hands, his chakra emanating in a dark green aura as it seeped into his friend, starting to re-attach tissue, and stop the bleeding for a moment. He stopped mid-way through, knowing it was useless with such a poison, but satisfied that he stopped the gushing, and left it as a slow seeping of blood. He got up, bracing the man's shoulder and tightening his grip to comfort him, as he said, looking up at a nearby forest: "I'll be back, don't touch the poison or I'll have more work to do." His body flickered in a sudden movement as a dust of wind formed behind him. As he landed just outside of the small forest, he looked to the ground, kneeling against it as he put his hand down against the soft grass. He narrowed his eyes, looking closer at the blades of grass as he noticed it was slowly turning into a dark brown before his eyes. He looked off to the side, seeing a few bent pieces of grass as well noting it as the area the attacker must have gotten his source of poison as well. His eyes widened as he looked up, realizing his presence here might have been planned out. He saw a glint ahead, and as he got up, retrieving his kunai, he readied himself. He bent his knees, and as the enemy's kunai closed in, Souretsu's keen reaction raised his own kunai in defense. In a rather effortless manner, he maneuvered his kunai to counter the other, causing the fast moving weapon to clash with his own. The enemy's kunai popped into the air, and as it did, a rather young looking shinobi sprang from the shadows. As the boy sprinted to Souretsu with a raised kunai, and a blood-curdling scream, Souretsu scowled, saddened to what he was about to do. Looking at the Kunai in the air, he gripped his own, sprinting forward as he raised his right, kunai wielding hand. He gritted his teeth as the boy raised his kunai to strike, and with little effort, Souretsu fell forward, slamming his left hand against the ground, bending his elbow, and pushing himself up. He spun a few times as he flew over the boy. He grabbed the kunai that was in air, and falling down, threw it back at the boy. As Souretsu landed, sheathing his own kunai, the boy's body skidded against the ground, his own Kunai having pierced into the boy's lower neck, and severing his spine, almost instantly killing him. Souretsu began to look around, and saw a rather peaceful looking plant moving back and forth from a gust of wind. Souretsu took a few steps forward, and leaned down, plucking the green-pedaled flower from the ground. He looked back at the still moving body of his friend, and again disappeared from the area, leaving the boy's dead body. As he appeared next to his friend, he kneeled down, cupping the flower in his hands as he concentrated his chakra into the poison holding petals of the flower. His chakra went from dark green to a bright greenish-white, as the flower petal disintegrated, and integrated itself into his chakra aura. He lowered his hand to his friend, as the aura seemed to eat at the bubbling poison, also healing the man's still bleeding nub. After a few moments, Souretsu lowered his hands, looking down at his friend. He looked over at the limb on the ground, and picked it up with his left hand. With his right hand, he lowered himself to pick the man up, the man's left arm curled around Souretsu for support. As Souretsu lowered his knees and shushined with his friend in the distance, the ashes of what used to be a poisonous plant blew away in the wind.*

<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Only, this might be..S-rank.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [lol]
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (something like that would be A ranked)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I don't know, it augments ninjutsu and taijutsu.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Eh.]
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (yeah, A ranked lol)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'll think of something.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Hm.]
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (but like I said)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (it would take some rping to develop)
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: ((Yeah, my char is gonna be a Nintai Spec. too.))
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [It's going to be a new fighting style.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Mine isn't a nintai spec.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Otherwise I'd have Karyuu Endan.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [:#]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'll just have an amazing fighting style.]
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (your Drunken Monkey is already pretty effective)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [So, if I add fire chakra to my fists and feet..]
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (anyway, gonna go rp)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I wouldn't have to hit my enemy to cause damage would I?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Just come close to it?]
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (it would burn them yes, but you would have to be pretty close)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I don't think iv'e seen you around here.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: i've*)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (make a profile
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: ((NEVAR))
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (*strips rank*)
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: ((Strip something else >:(  ))
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: . . . I'm usually at the Hospital helping with patients.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Oh I see, so you are a medical shinobi?
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: ((What's my rank called?))
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: Somewhat. . . Yes.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (Medical Corp Leader)
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: You're a Gennin, right. . .?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: And what. . . 14 or 15 years old. . .?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I'm 13.
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: You're a 13 year old girl, and you decided you were going to fight for your country?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: No, I decided that when I was about 10 and enrolled in the academy.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (9*)
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: At nine years old, you decided that you were ready to become a weapon of Konoha. . . Why?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Nothing better to do.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Why did you become a medic?
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: . . .
<br><font color=yellow>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) looks back at his cliboard, flipping through the paper once more.*
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: I wanted to help keep people like you stay alive..
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: That's good.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Actually.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I think I have seen you before.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I think you were at the hospital when my left eye was ripped out.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: And I had to be treated.
<br><font color=yellow>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) 's eye peers to the left as he took a glance at the girl's face. Before saying anything, he looked back at the clipboard, taking a small pencil from the top of it and jotting down a small note.*
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: Perhaps.
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: When did it happen. . .?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: A year ago, when I first became a genin.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: A training accident.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Took a shuriken to the eye, blood everywhere. It was injured beyond repair, so it had to be taken out.
<br><font color=yellow>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) 's eyes narrowed a little as he heard the word's "beyond repair". He thought for a moment, before saying plainly: "That's a shame, at least it wasn't in battle. . ."*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Yes, but it's alright.
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: You know. . . There have been a few recent breakthroughs with genetic reconstruction. . .
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Really?
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: I'm sure that by the time you get a little older, we could find something to do about that eye.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Hmmm.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: There is no need.
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: . . .?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I got a new eye.
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: Really. . .? And when was this. . .?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: A few months after the accident.
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: Hmmm. . . Shouldn't be too long before you can use it to see.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I can already see with it.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I just can't use it much.
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: ((You aren't really using Sharingan are you...))
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: Why is that. . .?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (what do you mean?)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Because I can't.
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: ((>.> nvm))
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (i got it icly)
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: Is your body rejecting it. . .?
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: ((*sigh*))
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: No, but it takes chakra to use.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: It some kind of Uchih eye.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: The sharingan I believe.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Uchiha*)
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: . . .
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: Who implanted the eye. . .?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: A medic of course.
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: . . .
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (>.>)
<br><font color=green>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) says: A Konoha medical ninja implanted a rare sharingan eye, something that other nations would kill for. . . into a 12 year old girl. . .?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Oh, hello.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: ..............
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Yo.
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) notices the headband on Zakku.*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: You come from Amegakure?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: What brings you here? If I may ask.
<br><font color=yellow>*Inugari, Souretsu(Nexus159) looks over to the Hokage's house for a moment, thinking whether or not to ask. He looked over at the boy of Amegakure, kind of confused as to why such a villager would walk all this way, or how he got past the gate.*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (Zakku is a grown ass man)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (not a boy lol)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Uh, 18.]
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (though he should be much older than 18)
