A shadow was linked between Mokutsu and Susumu, the situation he hadn't any information on it or knew what was going on. Though it seemed the shinobi was robbing Susumu."What's going on?" the teen question, he'd taken a step forward chakra began molding within him.* - Mon Oct 12 01:43:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shook his head after recieving the order from Hassan, the iron cork on his gourd undid itself. It began its decent towards the ground while iron sand erupted from his gourd. The eruption of blackened sand was controlled rather easily, the sand burst forward at a fast face. A large section of the sand branced off into two, one section headed for Susumu, the other headed for the shinobi that Hassan had in his grasp. 

As the sand made contact with their bodies it'd continue to consume each one of their bodies in the material until each one of them was consumed completely. Though he'd leave two holes availble for the two to breath, speech would be pointless, as well as squirming. The situation was dealt with swiftly and a waited for Hassan's call so he could question the two in private. "Oh, thank you." came from the teen after receiving the poison bomb from Reguel, though it wasn't needed at the time, maybe he'd need it in the long run.* - Mon Oct 12 02:18:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) his eyes went from Susumu to Mokutsu, his words meant for him."A shinobi should think before he acts, plus he's a comrade. Comrades are special, teamates on the battlefield and in companionship." though he didn't expect him to understand, most shinobi of this era never did, it was pitiful."Your punishment. A reminder to think before you act." with this, an idle hand was raised and extended outward aimed at Mokutsu's being. His eyes seemed filled with compassion for a litlte before all of it was devoured, only a cold look remained. 

He'd close his hand, this caused the iron sand that restrained his hand to tighten, pressure ran through out the thing until it imploded. Though only with enough force to break both of his wrists. Inside he was sorry for this, though he hoped it taught him a lesson, especially before using jutsu.* - Mon Oct 12 02:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes shifted from Mokutsu whom was already dealt with to Susumu."You're up next." that individual too was binded to the wall, both his hands and legs were spread apart. In honesty, he hadn't known what he'd done beyond this but stupidity came with a cost as well. The manipulator made a hand gesture, this caused the material to shape itself into a ninja tool, a kunai. With this tool he'd manipulate it, it neared Susumu's neck and levitated their for a moment."Stupidity costs you your life on the battlefield, i'll leave you with this to remember."  the kunai made of iron sand lowered from the shinobi's neck, it linned up across his chest area. With another hand gesture, a swift slash was made from the kunai, it'd cut through his clothing and cut his skin leaving him a rather large yet deep wound.

"You have to seperate your emotions Tetsumi, if it'll better them in the future..I'll do anything for this dream." the teen spoke to himself in his mind.* - Mon Oct 12 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "All right, you may tend to them now." his words were aimed at Reguel. As he said this, the bindings that kept both of them pressed against the wall left their bodies returning to his gourd. Which also meant, they'd fall towards the sand.* - Mon Oct 12 03:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) returned every bit of grain of his blackened sand back to his gourd, storing and sealing it away with the cork on top of it.* - Mon Oct 12 03:09:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) would've been on top of the house, he seemed to be meditating. Though he heard Bryson's words, "Yo? Ehehe, i'm all right." the teen tried to assure the priest, but his words were filled with lies.* - Mon Oct 12 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) smiled hearing Byson's words, he'd turn himself completely around to face him. Once done he'd resume his meditative stance, though his eyes were opened giving the preacher/doctor respect."..I don't know if you'd be able to help me, its a journey I have to overcome myself." a bright smile was brandished on the teen's face as he said this. He wasn't sure and doubted that a lowly preacher could help him, maybe at having a peace of mind. "Though there may be something you'd be able to help me with, since you're open to listen i'll need that ability of another sometimes."

Tetsumi's head looked skyward for a moment, a sigh being released from within. His eyes closed once more, he'd look within trying to find peace within himself. Maybe this was the first step to see eye to eye with the beast within, who knew.* - Mon Oct 12 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) once peaceful eyes shot open hearing Bryson's words, "He's a what?" it was ironic hearing about what Susumu was and his ability, especially after dealing with him himself moments ago."I see." the preacher's words, he believed to an extent since he'd seen Susumu's power, the 'necromancer' as the preast called him robbed another shinobi of speech and movement."Mhmm.. I see, i'll proceed with caution in the future." his eyes were tired, tired of this nonsense within this world and the sleepless nights. Though he knew everything came at a price, "Its only a little pain.. a little pain to achieve peace." the teen thought while thinking of his goal. * - Mon Oct 12 04:07:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Yo. Mhmm... I guess they are all right." he'd pay the merchant, in turn he recieved an empty scroll from the sales person. He'd bow while thanking the merchant, "Thank You." though he heard some of Reguel words from before he'd stay on standby before leaving. The scroll was placed in one of the many pouches around his waist, "Mhmm..What's going on now?.." the teen questioned in his mind while releasing a sigh.* - Mon Oct 12 04:48:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) view of things were warped at this time, the voices returned.."...Fucking...Why do they always.." as the teen mumbled the iron cork on his gourd was released from his gourd forcefully, an eruption of iron sand spewed fourt. It washed over him, it split into two sections. One section of the sand was aimed for the clone of earth, while the other was focused on the real Katsune.

The voices, it worsened for a moment..the voice he knew, it was him."Why..do they always fight, breed conflict...Why can't we ever have peace, friendshi-.." the voice in his mind boomed, "Humans are like this, conflict in itself is what they're here for." a sinister smile stretched along the teen's face, it didn't seem like the Jounin at all. The sand that was aimed for the molded, forming into a giant fist that would attempt to smash the clone easily, for one destroying it and nullifying -that- threat.

(Strategem Perk) His eyes..it focused on the real Katsune, though he could think clearly to an extent, clear enough to make the right decisions. He'd speak in his mind, "There is still hope for us." he believed this, it suppressed the urge to kill..Instead the sand would attempt to bind the real Katsune's movement. Though that probably would'v been futile, she was fast after all.* - Mon Oct 12 05:22:59 2015
