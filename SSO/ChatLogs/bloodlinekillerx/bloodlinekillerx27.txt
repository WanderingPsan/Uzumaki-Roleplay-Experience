He'd place trilliam's scroll off to the side, it wasn't his concern at the time. His main concern was getting a hang at unsealing the scrolls that Fuji left him, and so he'd do just that. His left hand reached out for one of the six scrolls that remained on the table, with one in his grasp he'd channel chakra through out the scroll. His chakra flowed through out the scroll, causing it to unravel though the chakra didn't seep into the seal. He tried to continue to flow of chakra, using the chakra he channeled to retrieve what ever was inside of the scroll but failed.

"Doesn't matter, I'll continue." he knew failure was apart of the drill, he had accepted this and had an open mind to it all. He'd channeled more chakra into the scroll, it daned along the seal. Utilizing the chakra inserted, the chakra flowed into the seal. He invisioned himself reaching and pulling something out, as if unlocking a code to a locker then reaching in. And so he did this, he'd finally unlocked the second scroll out of the batch of seven scrolls. It wasn't much but Tetsumi felt accomplished, smoke was produced as whatever was inside of the said scroll was released on to the table.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "All right, on to scroll five.." he'd reach out for yet another scroll amoung the cluster of them that were layed out on the table infront of him. With the scroll in his grasp, he'd channel the flow of chakra through out the scroll. The flow of chakra unraveled the scroll, it flapped open revealing the seal within. He'd attempt to do the same thing he'd down in his attempts with the two other scrolls. He continued the flow of chakra through out the scroll, but this time focused towards the seal. But he was unsuccessful in reaching in for whatever may have been inside, that was a bummer.

'Knock Knock' there were two audible knocks on the door, but he'd ignore it. His attention was drawn towards the scroll and only there. He was going to get the hang of unsealing whatever may have been in the scrolls that remained. The teen channeled yet another flow of chakra through out the scroll, the chakra worked towards the seal on the scroll.. Utilizing the chakra that flowed towards the seal, he'd reach in for whatever was inside of the scroll, scroll dials went off in his mind as he unlocked the seal. Smoke was produced as whatever was inside of the scroll was undone and released on to the table along the other things he'd released. "I don't want to be bothered." he'd thought, his eyes focused towards the door but he'd remain quiet inside.* - Sun Nov  8 22:29:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) heard Shira's threats at the door but continued to ignore him. "Not my house anyway." he'd thought while reaching out for yet another scroll among the bunch. He was at scroll number four this time around, focusing on nothing but the scroll in his grasp he'd channel chakra through out it. The scroll unraveled itself as the chakra worked along the edges, undoing it for him. With the scroll revealing its seal to him he'd attempt to work chakra into the seal but failed to crack the seal and retrieve what ever may have been sealed inside.

He'd continue, his eyes drifted away from the scroll towards the butom of the door. He still saw Shira's feet present at the door."He's still there." he'd release a low sigh before continuing in his drill. He'd channel more chakra towards the scroll, the chakra flowed towards the seal working around it. The chakra flowed into ths seal, it seeped into it unlocking the code of the scroll while retrieving whatever may have been inside. Smoke was produced as whatever was sealed inside of the scroll was released on to the table, joining the stack of items he'd unsealed so far.* - Sun Nov  8 22:51:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) released a sigh, his eyes focused towards the door. He heard Shira's pleas on top of pleas to get inside. Though he wasn't in control of that, nore was he planning to let anyone come inside. He'd just remain quiet and train, it wasn't like Shira could see him from outside, right? His left hand reached out for scroll number three on the table infront of himself, with the scroll in his grasp he'd channel a flow of chakra through out the scroll. The flow of chakra unraveled the scroll, its contents were revealed to his eyes, though only the fuuinjutsu marking of the scroll.  He'd continue to channel chakra into the scroll, the chakra worked towards the seal but he couldn't unlock the sealing formula of the scroll. "Tch... Still can't do this in one go." he'd mumble.

His eyes did two things, it went towards the door."He's still there." he'd thought, after this his eyes refocused on the unraveled scroll in his grasp. He'd focused more chakra through out the scroll and towards the sealing formula on the scroll. In his mind he imagined himself unlocking degits to a specific number dial or something along that line. He'd by passed the first section of the seal, his chakra continued to force its way through the seal until he grabbed a hold of whatever was sealed inside. His chakra drew out this thing, smoke was produced as the item was released, clattering on to the table along with the other items.

But he didn't care as much to do so, he'd reach out for the second to last scroll that remained. With the scroll in his grasp, he'd continue to channel chakra through out the scroll. The scroll unraveled revealing the fuuinjutsu marking at the center of the scroll. The flow of chakra didn't stop there, he continued the flow of chakra towards the seal attempting to unlock it and release whatever may have been inside but he'd fail. The seal didn't budge for nothing.

"Just.. concentrate." he'd repeat to himself, he'd apply another flow of chakra towards the scroll. The chakra flowed through out the scroll, until working towards the fuuinjutsu markings. He continued the flow of chakra, the chakra danced along the seals undoing it in the process. Once he broke the seal, his chakra reached in for whatever may have been sealed inside. Smoke was produced as the item sealed inside was released, it fell on to the table with the stack of other things that were sealed inside."He's.. still there.." he saw the imprint of his feet still present at the door. * - Sun Nov  8 23:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) reached out for the last scroll that remained on the table, at this point it was burried under all of the other things he'd unsealed previously. Reaching through the various things he'd unsummoned he'd retrieve the scroll It was held tight in his left hand's grasp, concentrating the teen sent a steady flow of chakra through out the scroll. The scroll unraveled, revealing its fuuijutsu imprint to the teen's eyes. It was the last scroll, this made him eager. The flow of chakra continued, pressing on while it worked against the fuuinjutsu seal but he'd failed.

"...I gunned it... that's all." he'd say while focusing more chakra towards the seal, his chakra danced along the scroll. The flow of chakra forced its way into the seal, undoing the fuuinjutsu lock on the scroll. His chakra continued to flow through the seal once by passing the fuuinjutsu sealing. The chakra reached in, grabbing a hold of whatever was sealed inside. Pulling out, smoke was produced as the item fell on to the stack of items he'd unsealed. The teen had done it, he'd unsealed everything Fujitora gave him to unseal. Hell he'd just leave the cluster of items there for his step father to stumble across.

His accomplishment soon fadded away, his attention focused on Shira whom still was at the door. "Why doesn't he leave me alone? Why not bother Fuji." the teen complained while planning and plotting his escape route to avoid confrontation with Shira.* - Mon Nov  9 00:08:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) retrieved a scroll from his pouch, it was one of the wind styled techniques izanami tasked the teen with learning. "This'll be a drag. Mhmm.." he'd unraveled the scroll, its contents revealed to the teen. Line for line the teen brushed up on the information, trying to gather as much information on how to perform the technique.* - Mon Nov  9 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) back was pressed against the wall behind of him. A scroll was present in his grasp, his eyes scanning the pages of said scroll. "Mhmm.. So.. I'd have to clasp my hands, then use that chakra.. I see." he'd mumbled to himself while continuing in his read on the scroll in his possession.* - Mon Nov  9 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) body lowered towards the ground, his body sliding against the wall. He'd come to a stop the moment he sat on the ground, the scroll still in his grasp.  His eyes looking over the scroll in his possession. Taking a break from reading he'd clasp his hands gathering chakra. He'd inhale air, while he did this he thought about the properties of wind. Blowing out, it didn't even manage a little gust of wind. Just an ordinary amount of wind expelled. It was as if the teen just blew out air from within, nothing special about it.* - Mon Nov  9 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Tch... that was... depressing." he'd noticed the three present in the area but wasn't bothered by their presence. In a sense, it made him work harder to get a grasp on the technique.  He'd pick back up the scroll, line for line he'd go over the information gathered about the technique in his mind. While he did this, he invisioned sharp and thin. That's how he needed his chakra to be, just sharp and thin.

"I'll get it." he'd promised silently.* - Mon Nov  9 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) went over the information within the scroll once more.  So far he'd gotten the general idea of the technique, hell he even had a bright idea to combine the technique with his iron sand based weapons. "If I get this, this'll go right!" he sounded delighted while continuing his read. He'd put the scroll off to the side of himself. 

Clasping his hands, he'd gather wind natured chakra within himself. In doing so, he'd expand the volume of the wind based chakra gathered within himself. Once he thought it was enough, he'd release the stored amount of wind based chakra, send a weak surge of wind out infront of himself. Though, he only managed to kick up some sand, nothing impressive.* - Mon Nov  9 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I understand...I think... If I..." hed roll back up the scroll while standing to his feet. The scroll was placed in his back pouch, his hands motioned towards the mid-section of his body. Clasping his hands, he'd gather wind based chakra within himself. It was a large amount of wind based chakra forming within himself, he still hadn't grasped the ideal amount of chakra to use for this technique. Compressing the wind based chakra within himself, the wind was controlled from within himself transformed into a powerful gale that raced forward, kicking up sand in the process.

"Woah!... I actually did it. Heh."* - Mon Nov  9 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sat on the sand below, he'd retrieve a scroll from his pouch. This time a new technique. Probably the last one he'd try to get a hang of today. Unraveling the scroll, the contents of the scroll and information on the technique was visible to him. "I see..." this was similar to the last technique he'd learn, well judging from the information he'd gathered on it so far that is.* - Mon Nov  9 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to read from the scroll in his possession, he'd take out an ordinary kunai. Holding the kunai over the scroll he'd focus.. The teen channeled his wind based chakra through the blade, while doing this he'd think about keeping it sharp and thin. Though the chakra channeled to the kunai wasn't near that at all, chakra wise it wasn't thin jagged and bulky, far from thin.* - Mon Nov  9 03:09:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm..." looked up from the scroll in his lap, his eyes were drawn on to both Mitsunara and Chikyu. It seemed as if the two were about to duel, sword for sword. A weak smile was visible on the teen's face for a moment before he refocused on the scroll in his lap. His eyes moved along the pages of the scroll, his mind soaking up as much information as he could.

Looking away from the scroll, his eyes went towards the kunai held in his left hand. He'd channeled wind natured chakra into the knife, trying to make the chakra flowing through it sharp and thin. Though he'd improved in this from the last, it still was mediocure at best.* - Mon Nov  9 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daishou(Simple.Sloth) says: ....What're you weirdos doin'? - Mon Nov  9 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm... To lumpy." he mumbled to himself, his words were meant for the chakra channeled into the kunai knife. It just wasn't there, not as the scroll instructed. It was too lumpy, he needed his chakra to be sharp and thin. His eyes refocused on the scroll in his lap, he simply went over the information in the scroll in his head as he read.

He'd focus on the kunai once again, everyone and everything around him became nonexistant, it was just him at the kunai. Channeling wind natured into the blade it was channeled around the edges of the blade. The teen tried concentrating on it, making the wind natured chakra more sharp and thin.* - Mon Nov  9 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked away from the kunai, his concentration broken. The flow of wind natured chakra through ou the knife had ceased as well. His went went to the source of what distracted him, "Mmm.. They seem to be having fun." though judging from Mitsunara's ablities, Chikyu seemed to be on the fence. Meaning she may have been having a rough spar, to boost the female's morale he'd holler "GO CHIKYU!" the two got off on the wrong foot their first encounter, but he did want to see her improve.

From the spar, his eyes refocused on the scroll in his lap.. He went over the information in his mind, "I can't get my chakra thin or sharp enough." he'd turn his attention towards the kunai, wind natured chakra flowed through the kunai knife. In his mind he thought about keeping the chakra thin and sharp, while going over everything he'd learn so far. The chakra sent through the blade was thin and sharp, but it wasn't there yet.* - Mon Nov  9 04:18:59 2015

Placing the kunai to the side of himself, he'd roll up the scroll that was once on his lap. Standing as he did this, he'd store the scroll away in one of the many pouches around his waist."Mhmm.. I'll try once more." Retrieving the kunai on the ground he'd hold a tight grip of it. 

Channeling wind natured chakra into the kunai knife, he focused on shaping the wind natured chakra into a more sharp and thin form. He continued this process until it was ideal thin and sharpness. "Heh, I think I got it." he'd throw the kunai into the wall behind of him, it pierced into the rock shattering the earthern wall. A line was visible, running up and down the wall. The kunai was lodged into the wall.* - Mon Nov  9 04:59:56 2015

Though despite how friendly he may have been, even down to the gesture Yoko might've reacted differently. 

"I wonder If I.. did somethin' in the past.." he'd thought while facing her.* - Mon Nov  9 05:23:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) released a sigh, he'd attempt to near Yoko. Each step he took was, caustious especially with her hand that motioned towards her holster. "Woah Woah, I'm not an enemy." he'd wave his hands while he said this, taking the final step forward he'd hold out his right hand. It was bear, no type of visible weapons. His nature and all wasn't threatning at all, he just tried to make friends.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widened as Yoko formed handseals, he immediately knew what the handseals were for. Well, what technique hell he'd even known how to perform the technique. Before his very eyes, Yoko sank into the ground utilziing the hiding like a mole technique. He could've stopped her, but refused to do so. For one, he was too lazy at the moment to, secondly he knew the situation would escalate if he chose to stop her.

He'd released a sigh while saying, "There goes the opportunity to make friends." he'd look up at the sky wondering if he killed anyone she cared about in one of his past rampages. He only thought on that since he didn't understand Yoko's behavior.. Well the reason for this type of behavior.* - Mon Nov  9 05:50:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Oh?.." watched as Marrisa formed a string of handseals, his eyes observing the seals she'd formed. In his mind he'd memorized the seals she'd formed, though he'd probably forget given time. Marrisa had taken in oxygen, before his eyes once she'd released taken in air. A powerful gust of wind was released from Marrisa's mouth, probably kicking up sand in the process and sending trash about if there were any present on the ground.

Though he wasn't going to give up right there and then. "All right." slowly he'd formed the seals that Marrisa performed, executed he'd take in air. Filling his lungs with oxygen he'd add his wind natured chakra intot he mix, blowing outside, releasing the trapped air as Marrisa did he'd attempt to perform the technique. 

Though the result of this wasn't one Tetsumi had in mind, he'd released a weak mediocure amount of wind. It was akin to if wind sudden kicked up, then quickly dispersed. "Ehh..." he felt a little embarassed.* - Mon Nov  9 10:40:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) faced looked unsure as Marrisa spoke, he'd focused on her for a moment. "You sure about that? Do sure do have a lot of faith in me." while saying this, he'd imagined Marrisa displaying the technique once more for him as before. "Mhmm.. A larger volume than I gathered and released. That's it." the teen thought, a smile forme don his lips.

Each seal that Marrisa formed, Tetsumi mimiced to perform the seals required for the technique shown. Executed he'd inhaled air, inside of his being he churrned and gathered wind based chakra. This time a larger amount as before, he was trying to get a feel for the technique. In what he think was enough, he'd exhale releasing a weak but stronger surge of wind from himself, kicking up sand in the process. Despite this, the displaced sand returned to its normal state a little too quickly. He wasn't there yet, not where Marrisa was.* - Mon Nov  9 10:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Good. . but gather more volume.. Hold onto it. . l;et it build! - Mon Nov  9 10:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //"Let it build? G'otcha." this was something he'd realized himself, he needed to gather a larger volume of wind based chakra. He didn't need to rush the process, every mistake, his mind took note of it. Especially with Marrisa's guidance, it made things a lot easier. "All right just gather, build up the wind natured chakra." he'd go over each pointer in his mind.

Forming the required seals for the wind based technique Marrisa had shown him, executed he'd inhale the oxygen in the air around him. While he inhaled the wind natured chakra churnned and gathered storing a larger amount this time. When he felt as if he'd gathered enough, he'd released the trapped wind. 

A stronger yet weak gust of wind was released from the teen, kicking up sand sand in the process. "Mhmm.. Better but.." he'd thought while looking on about his progress.* - Mon Nov  9 11:05:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //"I need to build up more wind natured chakra." in his mind, he went over everything he'd learned so far. He'd nod his head forming the required seals for the wind styled technique, executed he'd taken in a lot more air than the last time. As he inhaled, wind natured chakra churrned, gathering, multiplying in the center of his being. Pekering his lips, he'd blow outward releasing a stronger gust of wind than the last, kicking up sand in the process. "Not enough.."* - Mon Nov  9 11:17:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //"More chakra." once more he imagined Marrisa, well how she performed the technique. He wasn't aware of how she molding the wind based chakra within herself but he had an idea. Then.. She explained it, "More Chakra, Bigger breath, hold it, let them mingle then let it all out at once." he'd figured it a second before Marrisa blurted it out. It was good information either way, "G'otcha."

Tetsumi formed the required seals for the technique Marrisa formed, executed he'd inahed. This time as he inhaled he'd taken in a larger amount of oxygen from the air around him. As the oxygen from around him flowed into him, the wind natured chakra within him churnned, gathered, multiplied even greater than the last times. He'd stopped in haling, he was at his full lung compacity anymore and he'd probably throw himself off while causing internal damage to himself.

It was the perfect amount, well from what he'd thought. All at once, his lips parted as he expelled a powerful gust of wind natured chakra from within himself. Kicking up a larger volume of sand in the process, hell even kicking up some skirts of passing female civilians in the process. "I-I did it." though his accomplishment was short lived as he witnessed one of the civilians fixing their skirt and glaring at him. It was those eyes, he'd messed up again, though pink blotches were visible on his face.. He was embarassed from the sight, "Heh.. I say it was Sanoke's fault."* - Mon Nov  9 11:29:04 2015
