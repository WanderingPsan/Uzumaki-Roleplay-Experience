<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: No... But.. I guess we'll start with Konoha. Then, we'll continue our searches to the other villages. Though I'll probably use my third eye technique to search the village first, just incase we stumble into a trap. - Thu Nov  5 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Right...Caravan or on foot...or your platform? - Thu Nov  5 01:21:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: I'll use the third eye technique from the safety of my platform.. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Like Sanoke said, she might be in the forests. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I had to think out my strategy. - Thu Nov  5 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) brought his hand up to the mid-section of his body while gathering chakra. As he clapped his hands, the gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. On activation of said technique, the iron cork located on the teen's gourd was forcefully shot into the air, iron sand seeped out of the gourd. The expelled iron sand flowed below the teen's feet, forming a single platform of the material for flight. The two would have enough space on the platform for personal space issues if any. 

"A'ight. Here we go." he'd say while the platform of blackened sand rose up into the air. It glided through the skies, not at its full potential probably half speed. He still had to manage to spot any potential sign of Katsune by air.* - Thu Nov  5 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) maintained total control of the iron sand platform below their feet, his head went from left to right while looking below monitoring the area below. He'd hear Yan question, but he didn't look towards him he'd answer while his eyes scanned the area below."I've been relaxing, I retired ever since Madelyn left. Plus some other issues that took place, either way. I guess i've been chillin'." he'd joke while forcing a smile. Around his neck, a black scarf flowed while the two traveled on the platform. It was Kana's scarf, "I hope you haven't died on me." the teen wished in his thoughts.* - Thu Nov  5 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: We'll search the lesser villages as well. From up here, I'll use my technique. I'll be able to see everything. - Thu Nov  5 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) conversed with Yan while the platform continued its path through the skies, they were high up. "I'll try to find her." while saying this he'd brought two fingers up to his left eye, channeling chakra from the two fingers to his eye iron sand materialized taking the shape of an ordinary bird that flew around konoha. The bird gained color, its eyes were filled with eyes of their own. At this time both of Tetsumi's eyes were closed. He had full sight of what the bird would see, the bird flapped its wings before leaving soaring off towards the sky in a downward arc to get a clearer view.* - Thu Nov  5 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: did you bother looking at the comment - Thu Nov  5 02:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //bird continued to fly above, "Mhmm.. Doesn't seem like her." the original thought while the bird continued its course from above. Just a normal bird, it looked like any other native bird of the land.* - Thu Nov  5 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Maybe in the cave?.. - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //bird lowered towards the ground below, once on the ground its shape changed into a mole. With the color to match, it scurry across the ground and into the cave to scout the place.* - Thu Nov  5 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sighed, he'd change the mole's shape back into one of the local birds around the area. With that, it'd flap its wings and take flight once again. The bird would be on a course to return to Tetsumi soon enough. For the mean time, he'd say towards Yan."She isn't in that village. We'll check Konoha next." 

Time passed and the bird eventually returned to Tetsumi, while he did this he'd place the husk of the bird next to him. He'd remove the two fingers pressed against his left eye to his side, his vision returned and the eyes from the bird crumbled away.. The only thing that remained was an eyeless bird.* - Thu Nov  5 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Did you find anything? - Thu Nov  5 02:28:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: She couldn't be Katsune. - Thu Nov  5 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: She couldn't be Katsune* - Thu Nov  5 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Very well. - Thu Nov  5 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) observed as Konoha came into view, the two were high above in the air. "Time to get to work.." the teen thought while placing two fingers pressed against his left eye once again. Channeling two fingers to said eye, he'd close his eyes. Iron sand gathered in the bird's eyes, the sand formed into eyes that gifted the artificial bird with sight.  It flew downward from the platform of iron sand, it flew over the village, looking for its prize once again. Maybe they would be lucky?* - Thu Nov  5 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //bird continued to fly from above, it'd take note of Keiji's figure."Not her." the originl thought from his true location.* - Thu Nov  5 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //bird lowered towards the ground below, as it landed its shape changed into a small dog, additional sand was conjured for just a thing.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //dog walked inside of the hokage's mansion. It seemed eager, its tail wagged from left and right. Its eyes glanced taking in the individuals inside, he even noticed Mizora. "Mhmm..

"I've Mizora." he'd said towards Yan while landing the platform of iron sand down towards the mansion."We'll capture her first." with that said, the platform of iron sand deconstructed, breaking down into iron sand. The sand flowed back into his gourd but remained open.* - Thu Nov  5 02:58:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) left the village on one of his training drills once again, the area he stumbled across was ideal for the sort of training he had in mind. An audible 'pop' was heard as the iron cork from the teen's gourd was released. As the cork made its decent downward towards the sand, Iron sand flowed out of the teen's gourd. 
He'd focus on the dead husk of trees that were scattered about in the area he chose to train. He'd guide the sand towards one of the many dead husks around, the sand quickly consumed the dead tree husk's entiety. His palm remained open, as he closed his plam a surge of chakra ran through out the sand, causing it to constrict. The pressure intensified until the sand imploded, sending tree bark mixed in with sand everywhere. * - Thu Nov  5 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) watched as splinters rained about, in this moment he'd guide the sand over to the next dead tree husk, they were intruments of his training at this point. The blackened sand raced through the air, it smashed into the dead tree husk. The moment the sand colided with it, it became consuming the tree easily until the whole dead husk of the tree was consumed in iron sand. 

With one tree consumed, he'd raise his idle hand, his left towards another unoccupied tree. Reacting to this, the sand raced forward towards the other dead tree husk. Once the sand touched, it began to consume the dead tree husk's figure until it was completely consumed. Once done, both of his arms were focused on the specific trees. Both palms opened, once closed a surge of chakra ran through out the sand. It continued to contrict until the sand imploded from nothing but pressure, sending spliters everywhere. He'd hold up his hands over his eyes incase any splinters managed to get in his eyes. Though he'd forgotten about his sand shield for a moment in doing this, either way it made him feel normal from doing this, nor reliant on the sand for protection.* - Thu Nov  5 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) iron sand sprang to the life the moment the splinters threatened to get lodged in his skin, it protected the teen from all sides, protecting him in a miniature dome of iron sand. As the hail of spliters came to an end, the sand fell downwards towards the ground. His hands fell to his side, allowing him to take in the general area with his sight once again.  There were couple dead husks remaining, his training wasn't over as long as the tree husk's remained. 

His left hand pointed towards one of the dead tree husk's on the side of him, while his right hand pointed towards another. The sand followed the teen's command, the two portions of sand raced forward for both tree's. On contact the sand wrapped around it until it was completely consumed in iron sand.


Both of his hands remained open, while aimed at both trees. Closing his palms, a surge of chakra coursed through out the sand, sending pure pressure through out it. The pressure prolonged until the sand imploded, sending a shower of splinters everywhere as he'd done before.* - Thu Nov  5 21:47:44 2015

The moment the cork was released, a large amount of iron sand spewed out of the teen's gourd. 

The sand that was expelled was manipulated by the teen himself, the sand moved at a fast pace, grain on grain gathered forming a durable dome of iron sand around the teen. As the puny orb struck the dome, electrical charges flowed through the dome, followed by a slight shaking sensation due to the force of the orb's true power. Though it wasn't enough to break his sand's defenses.

Electricity flowed through out the dome, he'd take down the shield, the very sand opening from the top and continued to open up until the teen was revealed again."That's it? If so, i'll be going."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) searched hassan's office, so far he didn't see or hear any signs of an intruder. The moment teen neared one of the rooms he'd heard Ketsuki's voice saying "Shit, Bathroom!" before it got quiet real quick.

"SHIT!" went through the teen's mind, he'd run right into the room. On instinct he began gathering chakra, the gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces enabling his magnetic field. As he stepped through the door, the iron cork on the teen's gourd was removed, it fell downwards. As he banked the corner in the room, he'd notice an unknown individual pinning Ketsuki against the wall. 

"You.." he'd thought, if one focused on the teen an eruption of iron sand was seen from the teen. This large amount of blackened sand was focused towards Macbeth at a fast pace. The sand formed into a hand, that would attempt to grab on to Macbeths midsection. From there the sand would attempt to pull him away. If that wasn't possible, the sand would begin to consume his body from his current position, in an attempt to cover his entire body in iron sand, preventing movement of any kind.* - Fri Nov  6 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: ...Am I... this useless? - Fri Nov  6 03:21:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) body was thrown into the air, as if it no longer obeyed the laws of gravity. His sand as well was missplaced, from his manipulation."The hell?" the teen questioned, as the sword weilding individual attempted to slash at him in the moment. Coming to his rescue, iron sand materialized over the said slash attempting to protect him. But with the power the slash had, it'd easily slice through his sand.

He'd glance over at Ketsuki whom was knocked out on the floor, to lessen the dammage of the impending slash he'd resort to his armor of iron sand. This sand coated along his skin, hoping to lessen said dammage. As the slash most likely cut through his armor, blood gushed, a loud wail of pain was heard from the jounin.  He was helpless in the air, "I'M NOT GOING DOWN LIKE THIS!" the teen roared in his mind.

He'd use the tanuki's chakra, iron sand materialized over the side that the sword weilding individual struck. That side of his being was completely covered iron sand, a monstrous look it was. The sand continued to spread across his body, but that would be shown in the next turn.* - Fri Nov  6 03:30:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Is the dude inside turning people into monsters with his attacks? - Fri Nov  6 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) would've rolled out of the room and slammed into the wall south next to Toudou. The jounin groaned in pain, the half of his body that was transformed about by his shoulder oozed blood. But the sand soaked up the blood, staining his blackened sand."T-This.. actually hurts... Bastard..." the teen mumbled while forcing himself up to his feet. 

As the jounin stod up, the sand continued to spread along his body, until the other half resembled the monstrous half of his body. A tail that resembled the tanuki's sprouted to life, his very eyes matched the tanuki as well. If a sensor focused on the teen, they'd probably be scared shitless from the raw amount of monstrous chakra seeping out of the teen's chakra pools. it had a feel of blood lust to it, but the teen had the form under full control...For now.* - Fri Nov  6 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) a demonic grin was visible on the teen's sand coated lips the moment Fujitora gave him the signal. It meant the barrier was opene, even if it were brief or not he'd abuse this. He'd hold out both of his monstrous arms downward towards the floor, iron sand materialized below his feet forming a platform for transportation. It would be convient especially in this form that slowed down his overall physical speed.

He raced down the halls, and out of the kazekage's mansion and through the opened barrier. Most likely as he exited the barrier would close right behind of him. Soaring into the air, he'd begin to gather chakra. Simply he was making more iron sand out of his chakra plus with the additional iron sand that remained in his gourd. He was simply trying to cover the entire area around the office in iron sand and even expand this very range.* - Fri Nov  6 04:36:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) monstrous form was visible in the sky above, levitating in the sky above thanks to the platform of iron sand that kept him a float. His hands were focused downward as he focused, a large gathering of iron sand spewed out of his gourd, while some more sand was conjured into the field from the usage of his chakra. Yes, he was crafting more iron sand out of his very chakra. The large amount of iron sand, continued to surround the area around the kazekage's office.  

Once surrounding the office, he'd continue the advance of the sand's range trying to spread and increase his range further. "If I can't fight him head on, I'll fight him through these means." despite his aparent transformation, he still had his senses intact.* - Fri Nov  6 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to spread his iron sand around the building, especially the exit. As he did this, his platform of sand glided away from the kazekage's mansion while high above in the air. The sand was concentrated around the building, mostly the entrance. Though he glided away, just incase that he managed to get past his sand and somehow tried to escape. If it did come to that, he'd be left with no other choice.* - Fri Nov  6 05:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to gather chakra, the chakra sent through out the area. More of the teen's iron sand was summoned forth, responding, multiplying, coming to life from his chakra alone. In reality, there were two goals of this tactic. To stop the intruder once he managed to escape, and to prepare for a greater technique.

He'd notice Izanami down below, his voice seemed rough. Probably brought on by his transformation."Iza... RUN!" he tried to tell his sister, he knew how vast this technique truely was. If she was caught up in it, he wouldn't be able to forgive himself but the enemy had to be stopped.* - Fri Nov  6 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued channeling chakra through out the area, more iron sand sprang to life, brought forth from the very creation of the teen's chakra. More of the blackened sand, iron sand flowed through out the area. Around the kazekage's mansion, it was covered in sand ground level wise while the teen levitated above in the air preparing for the intruder. 

He'd finnally amassed enough iron sand for that technique, but for now he had to focus on detaining the enemy before he resorted to -that- technique. His monstrous form was probably visible in the sky, levitating with the aid of his platform of sand. "That's enough... sand... This really is bothersome making my own. But, he can't escape." these were thoughts that circulated through out the teen's mind, clear as a bell.* - Fri Nov  6 06:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) heard Fuji's voice from the radio, it was his signal to send in sand to detain and possibly kill the intruder. Though this wasn't the original plan but it still was an opening either way. Despite Fujitora's order to come in and do it, just incase things went sour he'd use the third eye technique to remotely control his sand. 

From in the air, he'd place two fingers over his left eye. Out of the sand scatered around the kazekage's office an eye shaped out of the sand. Said eye gained color to resemble his own eye, it floated inside while Fujitora allowed the barrier's entrance to become open once again.  

The eye levitated inside, the first thing that came into view for the teen were smoke."The hell?" he'd question as the eye continued its path inside. There were burn marks from a possibly explosion? And there on the ground, lacking any arms, bleeding out. It was Ketsuki... the same female Ai introduced him to. He felt a pain n his chest, "W-Wha?." he couldn't understand this. He even tried to preserve her life by taking on the intruder, he wasn't sure of the originator of her condition but he'd take it out on Macbeth.

The air fixed on Macbeth's person, a massive amount of sand forced its way through the kazekage mansion. Though only a portion of sand was focused in wrapping around Macbeth's figure in an iron sand coffin. His entire body would've been consumed in the blackened sand. On the outside in the air above the mansion, Tetsumi held the side of his head. He didn't understand this, but someone had to pay.* - Fri Nov  6 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Why?... - Fri Nov  6 07:52:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sand was deflected by a rotation of chaka, something that Koji did. At this point, he didn't care for preserving the man's life. Neither did he see a reason to, more sand rushed intot he room, it covered the rotation at every angle, waiting until he'd stop rotating. The moment he did stop rotating, sand would rush in, first disabling his feet so he wouldn't be able to rotate. The large amount of sand would consume both the hyuuga and the intruder.. If possible, but with how things stod it'd be a lot difficult for the hyuuga.

"I don't have any issues with you, I'm simply doing my job." he'd say from the outside, he was viewing everything within the room with his third eye technique.* - Fri Nov  6 08:03:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) opened a hole in the sand coffin for Fujitora's blade to pierce through, an opening for him to exploit. As he did this, he'd form a hand out of the iron sand to push Kuro out of the way, incase Fujitora's technique managed to hit him as well since the two were so close. Despite Kuro's action to preserve the life of a criminal he didn't want him to die. 

A person such as the intruder didn't need to be lacked up, being slain was the only option. If the blade weilding shinobi were to live, he could probably escape and shred through their numbers as he did before. He wasn't allowing any threats towards the village, in this moment he understod why the villagers were afraid of him and tried to kill him in the past.. It all made sense to the jounin in this moment, he watched on with the usage of his third eye technique.* - Fri Nov  6 08:25:10 2015
