<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) head swayed from left to right, he tried to memorize the troops faces but it was impossible, their were so many shinobi risking their lives over peace. He smiled silently, this is what it meant. "Unison...For the same cause." Tetsu thought as he brought his two shaky hands to the mid-section of his body gathering chakra. His hands didn't shake in fear, it was out of pure anticipation maybe some anger worked in there it was time to accomplish peace. 

The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field he'd simply remove the iron cork from the gourd. The utilized in the cork's form was broken down into iron sand and stored in his gourd he'd continue onward with the frontal troops but he'd stay in the middle ish of the formation. * - Sun Sep 13 22:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I need to attack from another area, a sneak attack...Tch." the teen thought as Zetsumo's army attacked the fronts, though before he could deliver a counter measure to this, it seemed as if the enemy troops were retreating. "Off.." Tetsu commented below his breath, he'd focus on Fujitora for a moment as he advanced with causion, he was prepared."Mhmm..I don't know very much from this location." his words aimed at Fujitora, at this time heavy steam was created.."They'll pick us off using this method. Or we'll run into our deaths" the teen commented, though it wouldn't matter he couldn't do much if he couldn't see anything it'd prevent potential friendly fire.* - Sun Sep 13 22:38:17 2015

He'd make some sort of hand gestures, prompting the iron sand that he stored in his gourd to spew out though a controlled amount, enough for a single platform of iron. The iron conjured from his gourd positioned itself under his feet, it became dense enough to support his weight before the teen was wisked away airborne to deal with as many troops from the air as he could.* - Sun Sep 13 22:56:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) remained silent, Tethy's words cut him deeply but he wasn't sure if it'd work..And if it truely did work, what would become of him? Is this how peace would truely be attained? The feelings were all there, it flowed through his being. Was this really true? It didn't matter, somehow he had to stop Zetsumo's rampage, the death he caused and more pain for the future generations to come. This was for everyone that wished for peace but died falling short of such a dream. "Revenge?" the teen questioned in his mind as Koeki threw him across the ocean.

The wind ragd in his ears, he'd close his eyes concentrating attempting to reach out to the beast deep within. Would it work? He wasn't sure but if it did he'd currently be hurling across the sea, his mind cleared for a brief moment. "One'O." Tetsumi thought, trying to catch the beast's attention. If allowed that deep, he'd be in the tanuki's court room, more like a prison. The golden glistened beneath his feet, the beast remained behind its bars comprised of forign lettering he couldn't deciever."I don't care if we're not friends, I need your power to attain peace. I don't have any hate against you, I just need your power i'm going to set things right." in his mind he thought about all of the lost troops, friends, family, now everyone fought for the same cause to stop this nonesense known as Zetsumo. "I lack balls, you told me that last time. You're the one that truely lack balls, you're afraid i'll preserve peace? Then again, if I fail you won't have a problem breaking free and taking over my body."

His will was as if it was on the surface, his will shaped into numerous fallen shinobi standing at his side in spirit as he faced off in his mind against the beast. * - Mon Sep 14 00:13:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) yawned a little, his eyes scanned the area painting a vivid picture of the scenery in his mind for potential strategic reasons later down the line. Since Yan insisted that he'd begin the match, he'd do such a thing. The teen clasped his hands gathering chakra, the chakra gathered was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. On activation of said field, the iron cork from his gourd shot into the air as an eruption of iron sand followed washing over the air.

With the eruption of the matterial, on cue it'd branch off forming into ten shuriken. Tetsumi's fingers extended outward causing the molded shuriken to propell forward at a fast pace at the blonde's figure."Let's test his reflexes." he had to dumb it down for this match, one he was rather bored and two he didn't want to hurt Yan.* - Fri Sep 18 23:17:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmmm..I could either stay here and waste my time fightin' these things, or take him out rather quickly.." though it might've been fun to stick around and destroy each clone, he had to think strategicly speaking. The clones were bothersome, the remaining five clones? Darted forward spewing mud at him, he knew the technique. He'd quickly make a hand gesture, prompting iron sand to form underneath him. The iron below his feet became rather dense, forming a platform of iron. The flow of mud neared him, with this he'd attempt to take to the skies, avoiding such a confrontation.

If he was sucessful, he'd register the area from above."Mhmm..I know what i'll do, easy enough." he thought.* - Fri Sep 18 23:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) wasn't aware of the genjutsu, neither did he care as much. Above a large amount of iron sand gathered above before breaking down into droplet's of the matterial hoping to spread along the area below. The illusionary bird in question, if it was real or not sand from his gourd would attempt to protect the manipulator from potential harm, it looked as if it wasn't even in his control, it just did its job.* - Fri Sep 18 23:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) seemed to be protected from the potential danger, though it proved to be fruitless in the long run. Birds of many darted through the shield if iron that protected him, "The hell?" wasn't sure why or how the birds managed to simply fade through his shield of sand. If that wasn't bizarre  enough, the birds managed to faze through him as well..He'd remained calm, it wasn't scary to him. The shield protected him, keeping him airborne incased in the shield it was a plus for what he was about to do.

From the shield, a portion of it torn itself off about from the right side of it maybe making it a bit undetectable? Who knew.  He'd close both of his eyes, a small bird formed from the air sand removed from the shield. Its eyes were blank for a moment before both being filled with life, in another words filled with artificial eyes of its own, what the bird saw Tetsu saw. Though the bird resembled a common small bird of Kirigakure.

What would he see? The birds swerming the shield protecting Tetsu for one, another thing there was one less Yan below."W-..Below maybe?.." he knew Yan posessed that technique since he utilized such a thing in the war in Konoha. Though, it was a hunch. The sand below that managed to scatter across the battlefield, were formed into sharp spikes attempting to destroy each clone below.* - Sat Sep 19 00:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm,I'm out of here. - Sat Sep 19 00:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) watched as his shield of sand took apart itself, the sand utilized was transported back into his gourd. The bird that worked as an extra sight for the teen broke down, converting back into iron sand, that portion of sand joined the amount below. "Mhmm...He's probably below hiding or one of those clones." the teen wasn't sure, though he'd remain on the platform of sand. "These birds, probably a genjutsu..No way the sand would'nt protect me from harm." then again, it could be that One'O grew tired of him and wanted his potential death, who knew he only had a hunch to go by on.

The clones, he'd leave them come to him or vanish or there own..He couldn't waste time just floating there any longer, "All right." he'd understod what he had to do,  the sand that inhabited a large amount of the battlefield formed into many drills below that rotated destroying the earth below attempting to drill a hole through the earth. Even cave it in if possible by the many drills that dug at the earth.* - Sat Sep 19 00:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) observed as the multiplying birds vanished, "Mhmm..He can-" at this time his Iron sand erupted from his gourd firstly attempting to form a portion of the shield where Flexus's enlarged hand attempting to strike. Then the shield would continue until Tetsumi was protected completly in the iron's protection, he'd hear the fist pound against the shield of sand. It didn't crumble or break though it shook the whole thing, shocking him about the sheer power of such a punch, but he'd seen stronger punches before especially from his step mother, that even sent chills down his spine, the thought of it alone.

As the shield was erected keeping itself in place, Tetsumi formed sharp spikes along the shield attempting to pierce through Flexus's skin. Just a reminder of him staying in his lane, maybe the pain along from it would scare the chubby shinobi away.* - Sat Sep 19 01:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) the tree broke apart, but the sheer force sent the dome of iron rocketing into the ground somewhere off below. Though it stayed intact, "..Little.." the teen cursed before the sand was safetly transported back into the gourd. Flexus in question was now apart of the scuffle, the area held a large amount of iron sand alongside it. Was the chubby kid fast enough to avoid his sand? He grew intrested in this thought,  how much of his body could he expand? 

Tetsumi made a simple hand gesture, prompting the irons and on the ground to race forward at a surprisingly fast pace at the fatso.  A portion of the racing sand, broke off into sections that focused on Flexus's hands, legs, and even head attempting to restrict said areas before completely devouring his being hoping to subdue him for the time being. Hopefully that was one threat taken care of. 

A good amount of sand was left behind, incase his friend Yan desired to jump out and attack. Plus there were still the issue of the clones that remained. If it wasn't for his sand's abiltiy, he'd surely have been defeated moments ago probably.* - Sat Sep 19 01:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm...Impressive, i'd need more sand." the battle seemed to be quite intresting though it seemed the chubby giant was struck by Yan's spikes of earth. He'd use this to his advantage as another enlarged punch was sent his way, maybe it'd have a delay to it? Maybe enough for his reflexes over the years to avoid a direct hit from such a powerful attack. 

He'd utilize sand from his gourd, it formed below his person like a platform but it wasn't it formed into a mini wave that he surfed out of the area. If the punch landed, his shield would defend or he'd use his reflexes to potentially avoid a direct hit.* - Sat Sep 19 01:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) tried to avoid le trees coming at him, via reflexes and sand hopfully avoiding it.* - Sat Sep 19 01:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thought he avoided all of the trees aimed at him, oh how mistaken the teen was. On its own, sand erupted from the gourd once more, washing over him forming a couple shield of iron protecting him from the tree's wrath. "...I'm tired of his technique." as the shield gave way since the potential harm was out of his way, he'd form another hand gesuture, prompting sand to form beneath him. 

The sand became rather dense before he'd br taken towards the sky, Flexus was potentially out of the picture. At this time he'd attempt to gather every grain of his sand, transporting it back into his gourd before departing the area by air. "Mhmm...its better this way, I haven't had sleep in some time...I'd hate for it to become a lot more messy if I couldn't keep awake.* - Sat Sep 19 02:18:52 2015

"Zetsumo's.." a fire burned deep within the teen, he couldn't do anything last time or the time before against the man but he wouldn't give up, so many people lost their lives.

Tetsu swiftly brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body, gathering chakra and converting it into magnetic forces. Strategicly speaking, it was best he'd taken an aerial approach this time. The iron cork on his gourd shot skyward, even beaking back down into iron sand as more of the matterial erupted from his gourd. Though the desired amount required for a platform of iron, the sand gathered beneath his feet becoming rather dense to support his weight before wisking him off skyward yet forward over the battfield.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) observed the scene from above, Zetsumo was finished yet he didn't feel...quite at peace. Hell, he wanted to kill the man himself but that wasn't it, he just didn't see it or know what it was but something wasn't right. "There isn't anything else for me here." the teen thought from above, the platform of iron lurched forward heading west from the area to god knows where, he wasn't sure himself.* - Mon Sep 21 00:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) wasn't sure how much time had passed since that day. The day everything seemingly returned back to normal, the day everyone all shinobi and occupations a like could return to their normal lifes. It was the day Zetsumo lost his life, still the teen felt empty since he hadn't done much, he didn't feel like he avenged the fallen with his own hands. Either way, that was life and it moved on even if he liked this or not.

"How long has it been?" the teen questioned himself, he dwelled in shelter comprised of trees, hiding from the rain when the weather got like this. He didn't live in any of the villages, he traveled visiting smaller establishments. That's how he gathered food, freash water, and also gathered intel. Especially on something rather intresting, suna's aparent uprising its leader seemed to be the old coot, Hassan.

Though he couldn't see himself returning, not now. Especially if it ran the risk of him escaping and taking more lives. It was best he trained in the wilderness, bettered himself and somehow manage to get a better understanding of the beast and himself. If the worst happened, at least others wouldn't die along with his downfall. Who knew how long he had left until he found an opening, either way Tetsu was determined to find a way, he was on his own either way though it didn't feel like it.* - Thu Oct  1 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked up at the night sky, he'd held out an idle hand trying to feel any rain drops from above but felt nothing. The rain had stopped, he motioned from trees that aided him with shelter. It was time for him to train, he hadn't done this in a while in this area. Usually he tried to get in contact with the beast, trying to understand it more despite it throwing threats at him, and as its usually behavior and attempts at trying to decrease his moral. It succeeded at times but he wasn't going to give up, not just yet.

He approached an idle tree, some ways up from the actual place in where he lived for the moment. He didn't want to attract any attention around that area, it'd suck if someone found that area, tampered with it, tried to ambush him.. These were things he had to think about constantly now, at least this way his mind wasn't idle and busy. Tetsumi's hands motioned towards the mid-section of his body, their he clasped his hands gathering chakra. The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. 

On activiation of said field the iron cork on his gourd shot skyward as iron sand fleeted from the gourd. Willed by hand gestures made by the teen, he'd form another prompting the sand to wrap around the base of the tree. Their were a delay between the next action, this he tried to improve, the delay between his techniques something Zetsumo managed to do. The sand binding the tree tightened, sounds of crushing of bark could be heard. Splinters were out of place, the pressure increased as he clenched his fist, crushing the middle portion of the tree. 

The tree tilted to the side, birds in the tree flew out. He felt yet another drop of water, it began drizzling. Thus meaning his time was up, he'd manipulate his sand funneling it back into the gourd. The iron cork that laid across the grass levitated above the grass, racing above the teen's head before fixing itself above the gourd sealing off the hole on top. "Tch, this weather." he couldn't really complain, it was peaceful to an extent. He'd made his way back to his shelter, sitting down he kicked back enjoying the rain. Where would he travel next was on his mind, he wasn't sure.* - Thu Oct  1 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to traverse through the forest, a bored expression worn on his face. His belly growled, he'd look into his food supplies noticing it was rather low..He needed to restock and fast, this was the draw backs of traveling alone, not truely having a home or work. He'd look off into the distance, a head their was a path that seemed rather familiar to him."I know that path...maybe I can get some supplies from there." maybe he could, he wasn't sure especially since he'd been MIA from that place for a while now.

Reguardless Tetsumi went down the path, crossing this path he knew from here on it'd be a lot dangerous for him, that and he wasn't quite fond of being noticed. It was better that people didn't know of him, let his existance to others fade away until they'd need him that is. For now, it was better off this way. He'd retrieve a mask from one of his many back pouches, just looking at the thing triggered so many memories that flowed through him. 

"Heh..those days." he'd brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body, gathering chakra. The teen clapped his hands forcibly, emitted a loud sound from his hands starling birds in the process but enabling his magnetic field at the same time. The iron cork from his gourd slackened as it shot into the air, the cork itself converted back into iron sand as it melded in with the desired amount of sand for the platform. A single platform of iron formed below his feet, it'd become rather dense, dense enough to support his weight. A hand gesture was made as the teen was wisked off into the sky above, there was another delay in between his techniques before executing the other.

He'd  brought his left hand up to his left eye, as it was placed over it he channeled chakra to the eye. Iron sand slithered out of his gourd, the sand taking the form of one of the native birds around the area. In one of the bird's empty sockets, an artificial eye formed. In that eye the teen would see what the bird saw, he'd continue to travel from above while the bird traveled around monitoring the area from below, maybe he could scare some traveling merchants into giving him some food.* - Fri Oct  2 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) steadily lowered the platform of iron below his feet, it decended smooth from the skies above. It landed somewhere off near a set of trees below, it was enough to hide himself out of sight for the time being. He landed safely on a  tree branch, high above. The platform of iron was funneled back into his gourd, he leaned against the tree a bit tired from all of his travels thus far.

The masked teen undid the straps to his backpack, his hand undid the zipper and motioned inside of the bag retrieving a water bottle along with a single rice ball. He'd taken a drink from the bottle of water and taken bites out of the rice ball. "..Mhmm.." he looked off into the distance..he was so near yet it seemed so far away. "Amu, where are you?" the teen questioned, last he saw the woman she was in Konoha in one of the places where he stayed during the war, he did tell her to return..maybe she did?

Either way it couldn't be helped, he had to find out. A gentle breeze blew by, rustling the leafes attached to the branches of the tree.

* - Fri Oct  2 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) once again lost track of time, "..*Yawn* Slacked off to long.." the masked teen stretched out a bit, his back felt a bit funny after laying back against the tree for so long. He'd clasp his hands gathering chakra to the mid-section of his body, the gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces enabling his field. The desired amount of sand spewed out of the gourd, it fashioned itself under his feet as it became dense to support his weight. It was decided, he'd check for her as well as gather supplies for himself. With this in mind, the mask teen was off towards the sky continuing his travels.* - Fri Oct  2 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) noticed the sandy terrain coming into focus, "Almost there." the concealed teen mumbled, he raced through the skies aided by the platform below his feet. Below he'd hear a faint scream or cry for help, "Mhmm?" he'd look below noticing four figures pursuing a girl, trailing behind those four was a man his hands fixed behind his back. The man in the back looked as if he hadn't a care in the world, it was as if he moved at his own pace defying even time itself.

"...Should I do something?..." went through the teen's mind, he wasn't sure if he should or not though while he thought about this they'd caught up with the girl. One of the figures that pursued her grabbed a hold of her and pushed her down towards the sand. She had a face full of sand as well as four individuals that began roughing her up, she sobbed begging for help.. But obviously there wasn't any help for the girl, the last man caught up. At the man's side a sheath was evident there, he drew the sheathed weapon from his side it had dry blood on it.

The maked teen's body twitched seeing this, he couldn't allow them to hurt her.  Behind of his mask he eyes shot open, if it was visibly it'd look wild crazed even. Swiftly he brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body, at this point he fiercly clapped his hands, from below it'd sound like a faint sound but from above it packed its meaning. A metallic type of sand? Erupted from his gourd, as it erupted the first action he did was mold the first section of the sand into ten shuriken. Each guided at the five individuals two for each of them, even the man that lagged behind with the katana drawn. * - Fri Oct  2 21:44:19 2015
