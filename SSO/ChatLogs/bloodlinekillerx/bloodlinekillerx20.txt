<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widened the moment Tetsuki summed fourth a black blade, "That looks like.." his train of thought was put a side as the kid ran towards him. Despite her age, he knew she was very skilled but not to the degree that she probably was at.  He'd brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body swiftly as Tetsuki dashed forward, he'd gathered chakra and converted it into magnetic forces. Clapping his a hands, a loud sound was emitted from the teen, the magnetic field came into play at this time. 

A 'Poping' sound was heard as the iron cork from his gourd was shot into the air, as it was released from his gourd a large amount of iron sand erupted from his gourd. He'd prevent Tetsuki from getting close, and take advantage of the battlefield at the same time. The large amount of sand washed over infront of Tetsuki attempting to wash her away, as well as push her back away from advancing near him.

Another portion of the sand continued to flow on to the very ground of the arena, spreading the blackened sand along the ground.* - Fri Oct 30 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I've been at this all day.. One match after the other. - Fri Oct 30 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) wasn't able to detect Tetsuki, "Where in the he-" was heard from the teen, at this moment the girl attempted to strike at him from the side, a blind spot. "Smart" he'd thought, reacting to counter such a thing the iron sand around him moved on its own at a fast pace forming a durable wall to counter. Utilizing nothing but his heightened reflexes to react quickly while Tetsuki was in close, head send a portion of sand to her feet, it moved fast. Once this portion of sand moved to her feet, it'd continued to comsume her body, more sand fed into the technique until it completely comsumed the child in the blackened sand.* - Fri Oct 30 03:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Sand...More sand, this is crazy.." he'd thought while registering the area for Tetsuki once more, he drowned Tetsuki's words out. He had to focus on Tetsuki's where abouts, yet he couldn't find her. She'd appear underneath him, attempting to yet again, attack him. His sand raced forward, it became dense as it proceeded to defend against Tetsuki's attack. "Can't fight her on the ground, i'll lose." He'd form the iron sand below his feet into a spring, this spring launched the teen into the air to avoid further attacks.

While air borne, sand flowed out of his gourd it channeled beneath his feet forming into a durable platform of sand. This platform allowed Tetsumi to float, he defied gravity itself."Mhmm..I find this cheap, but..I can't believe she forced me into flying. I need to rethink a new strategy. I know... First.. I'll need to rid of of that blade but.." the teen remained air borne thinking of potential strategies to use against Tetsuki. 

For the mean time, the sand continued to spread along the arena below, spreading the sand's range.* - Fri Oct 30 04:13:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "G'otcha." the teen thought as Tetsuki revealed herself for him. She attempted to jump upward, where his platform floated above. She was in his grasp, the blackened blade that resembled Tethy's blade swung at him. This is where he'd use his sand's ability to his advantage. More sand from his gourd spewed out, forming a dense wall or shield to protect the teen from the potential attack. As that was done, as well to prevent the blade from potentially breaking through his defences, a he'd send yet another portion of sand towards the blade trapping in the sand from further movement hopefully.

(Stratagem Perk) It was time to turnt he tables on the brat. With her sword rendered useless and Tetsuki airborne. A large portion of sand gushed out of his gourd aiming to trap Tetsuki, as well as sand racing from below to block off either route. 

The platform itself slowly rose higher away from Tetsuki, it acted as a safety procaustion.* - Fri Oct 30 04:25:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm..." was heard from the teen, he kept Tetsuki in the coffin of iron sand up to her neck. His platform slowly decended to the ground below. Once landed, the sand retreated from Tetsuki's body and into his gourd. As well as every  grain of iron sand that was utilized in the spar. 

With the match coming to a closure, he'd exted his left hand outward for a fist bump."You did great! Look at the bright side, you caused me to fly. That's a win for you in my book." he'd say while smiling and a waiting his fist bump before he nuggied Tetsuki like he did Trilliam.* - Fri Oct 30 04:33:29 2015

His feet crossed over until it resembled a meditative stance, after this his hands motioned towards the mid-section of his body clasping them. With his eyes slowly closing, the world around him grew dim until it was completely closed off from his sight.

He'd remain quiet, images flashed through his mind. His body twitched for a moment, he felt dread. "Why couldn't I do better?.." he questioned himself, a voice boomed through his mind.

//Shukaku"You can't do better, because you ignore my words. STUPID HUMAN! I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I GOT STUCK WITH AN EMOTIONAL WRECK LIKE YOU!" his voice boomed through out Tetsumi's mind, scolding his host.

//Tetsumi remained quiet, he couldn't say much. Why? Because what ever the beast had said, out of a clutch to win him over and break free.. Neither the less the reason, it all were true. Maybe he should live for himself, and only himself.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) wasn't sure where he'd go, what he'd do.. He just threw the idea out first, he didn't expect this reply from Kana."Well uhh...Mhmm..." the teen pondered for a moment before deciding on where he'd go. The iron cork on top of the teen's gourd slackened as it fell off, as it fell off it deconstructed back into blackened grains of sand. More of the blackened material flowed out of his gourd, until it had enough for a single platform of iron sand for both himself and Kana. The material became dense, allowing it to suppor both of their weight. 

It shuddered a bit before rising into the air, his hands were folded across his chest as the platform soared through the sky.."Where...mhmm.." he'd thought.* - Fri Oct 30 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked off into the distance, he didn't focus on Kana at all. Just somewhere else that seemed like sand for days. He'd easily fly over the wall of the village, leaving to go elsewhere accompanied by Kana herself. It seemed as if a whole ten minutes passed while the two were on top of the platform. Despite the speed that the two were going, he still had a ways to go until arriving at that location. 

"Why are you so... Are you afraid to open up?" he'd asked Kana since the two were alone. If she were to punch him for asking, so be it he didn't care. Though the question intrigued him greatly, in a way she reminded him of someone.. Another girl he knew of in his youth, though she died as well.

If she answered or not, below an earthern cavern came up. He'd fly through it, until their was an opening. For the time being there was nothing but complete darkness. If they even got passed this together with out Kana choking him or beating up on him..Something of that nature, a bright light.. Light fromt he sun beamed down on both of them from the opening. It was warm and welcoming, as they'd fly through water was visible. The earth with in this place worled as a containment for the water, like an eartly bowl. Below, there was a winding path that lead downward towards the water. The sun glistened on the water, it was a beautiful sight, though he didn't expect Kana to think much of it.

The two remained on top of the rocky trail, overlooking the entire scene. The sand at their feet, broke down and funneled back into his gourd for later usage.* - Fri Oct 30 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) a weak smile formed on his lips the moment Kana's emotionless side of herself gave way for even just a moment, it was worth it despite how brief it may have been."Its... This is a place I found during my travels, when I traveled alone, I came across this place. I also meditate her at times." he'd look up at the sky once more, his body motioned towards the winding path that lead down to the water.

"If you don't open up, how am I to help you? You're harder to crack than a turtoises shell' he'd joke while he walked away from Kana, maybe she'd follow him?* - Fri Oct 30 20:45:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) once again, the sand defended the teen from potential harm. He'd pout a little, "I mean it. But.. seriously Kana, I'll stop for now ahahaha. I came here so you'd take your mind off of what ever may be plauging your mind. Past events? Anything really."I'm only doing this cause I care." he'd shrug his shoulders, as he continued to walk down to the water. Once infront of the water, he'd stare into it, reflecting on his past.* - Fri Oct 30 20:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) blushed a little as Kana positioned her head on his lap. Though he didn't say anything after that, he'd lay back as well.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) decided he'd take a peek at Kana while she slept? Maybe she was sleeping foreal this time verus the last time where she tested the teen. "At least you aren't angry in your sleep." he'd look elsewhere, this time towards the sky. Times like these, he wished he could've slept with out the result of potentially killing someone in the process. 

He'd brought his hand, which ever might've been near to her head and ran his fingers through her hair trying to comfort her while she slept. As quickly as he did this, probably in five seconds he'd place his hand back behind of his head and look at the sky.* - Fri Oct 30 22:16:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) felt a cold sweat coming on the moment it managed to wake Kana up. Though, he was grateful that she hadn't realized what it really was and beat his ass. Though, the bad thing about it.. She went back to sleep. He needed to move, but yet again he wanted her to sleep for a change. He'd release a heavy sigh while looking at the sky. While Kana slept he'd say to himself trying to think elsewhere other than Kana."Why do this happen...Damnit... Think of happy thoughts.." he was at that stage in property, things like this were completely natural, but would Kana understand? Probably not.* - Fri Oct 30 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) face turned a bright red taint, he'd avoid eye contact with Kana..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) decided he'd read through the scrolls of various techniques his younger sister gave him."Mhmm..I'm...going to have my hands filled.." the teen complained as he stared in awe of the collection of scrolls, there were four scrolls in all. Though he'd probably only learn one of the techniques from the bunch. Why? Cause the description of the other scrolls wasn't him, it took too much effect. 

He'd reach out for one scroll in particular, it was labled "Interregation Technique" this caught his attention. This technique is one he'd need in the long run, especially with dealing with liars or obtaining vital information down the line. He'd undo the scroll, its content revealed to him. "Mhmm.." was heard from the teen, he deciefered and analyzed the infromation within the scroll. 

So far through his reading, he'd uncovered how to perform the technique. Simply he'd have to place a hand on the desired targets head, and utilize his chakra to disrupt theirs thus putting the said target under the illusion. Though, it probably was a lot harder than the scroll implied.* - Sat Oct 31 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm.." stared at the other three scrolls, maybe he should've learned about those various techniques, as well as figuring out how he'd perform such techniques."I see..Maybe I should learn those other three techniques. It was decided. Tetsumi undid yet another scroll, its information laid out infront of his very eyes. His eyes read the infromation of the scroll word for word, making sure not to have miss read any vital steps or precedures in performing the technique.

"Doesn't seem as difficult.. Though..." so far he learned a little about the technique, he understod parts of what it did but he felt lost. "The technique creates clones.. like the Bunshin technique but.. They don't disperse." he'd converse with himself, trying to deduct the information and rule out false assemptions or if he miss read the information in the scroll. 

Scratched the back of his head as he read over the entiety of the scroll. "I see.. I just over thought it all, its not that difficult. Maybe I could even use iron sand kunai with this technique.. Mhmm.. This way it'd be a lot more difficult to avoid, plus I can..." the ideas that formed in his mind, it made the teen smile a little as well as promting hm to continue on his studies.* - Sat Oct 31 08:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stared at the two remaining scrolls, for the time being since he had other skills to polish, he'd store both of them away in his back pouch. Stretching a litle he'd look off into the distance, "I'll polish that technique later, for now.." he'd brought both of his hands up to the mid-section of his body, as he did this chakra gathered at the center of his being. Clasping his hands, the gathered chakra converted into magnetic forces enabling his magnetic field. 

An audible 'Pop!' was heard from the teen's gourd the moment the iron cork was removed, iron sand flowed out of his gourd. It was a large amount of the blackened sand, enough to form four clones of sand. He'd concentrate, the large portion of sand exponged from his gourd spit apart into four section that quickly molding rising up and changing in shape and density. The iron sand formed into four identical copies of the manipulator, all four the clones gained color as well which made them resemble the teen even more.

"All right, time to continue my training." he meant where he'd left off last since he'd put this type of training on hold for a time being. Why? Because he needed to focus on Shukaku, now it was time to continue his training with the speed and delays between his techniques. 

Another eruption of blackened sand was visible, a good sized amount, enough to cover a single clone's entire being. He only required this much of sand, this also helped with decided on the amount he'd probably need during battle. The portion of sand raced forward, he'd remember how he dealt with a target as he followed through with the action of binding said clone. A portion of the sand aimed for the iron sand clone's hands first, the remaining material bombarded the clone from its feet to the crown of its head. 

There a paused between the final action, not because he wanted to but it was the calm before the storm. He had to improve in this area, before he clenched his hand thus setting off the technique he invisioned fire, a large amount of it consuming him burning him alive.. "Can't.. I'll get better." the teen encouraged himself, his palm closed sending a surge of chakra through out the sand. This surge or influx of chakra caused the sand to constrict, pressure ran through out the entire thing until the sand imploded. Blackened sand rained about, the clone was no more, it was destroyed.

Once the clone was destroyed, his eyes washed over the training grounds for the three other clones of sand. He'd locked on to one of the clones, wasting no time at all sand from the destroyed clone as well as the sand utilized in th previous sand coffin raced over towards clone number two. How he'd disable an opponent played out in his mind, he'd follow his mind with his actions. A portion of the sand binded the clones, hand first, the other portion of the sand then binded its feet. From the clone's feet, the sand continued to consume the clone's body until it was completely covered in the material.

There was yet again another delay between the teen's finishing attack, "Improve." he'd announce while shutting his hand tight. This caused a sure of chakra to course through out the sand, pressure swept over the coffin. This pressure worked against the clone inside, so much pressure until the sand imploded sending sand scattering about the area.

As the raining sand stopped, he'd focus on the next clone down the line. His eyes locked with the third sand clone's eyes, a smile formed on the teen's lips as sand form gathered, it swirled violently before he could've attacked.. Someone approached from behind, the sand subsided. On noticing the individual that approached him he'd stop, every grain of the blackened sand funneled back into his gourd for later storage."What do you want?" he sounded pissed, but his face plank.* - Sat Oct 31 10:28:54 2015
