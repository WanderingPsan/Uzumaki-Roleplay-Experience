The iron cork from his gourd was released, it shot skyward as a massive amount of the blackened sand formed around Tetsu encasing him completely in it hopefully protecting him from the flames.

After the flames died down the shield undid itself revealing a much serious Tetsumi from just a moment ago. At this time a large amount of sand erupted from the gourd, as well as the utilized in the shield burst forward racing at a fast pace for the young shinobi.(10 tiles speed.)* - Wed Oct  7 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: She's gotten better. - Wed Oct  7 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "That's the technique Fuji uses, how bothersome." the shuriken weren't an issue. Though he couldn't allow himself to get trapped, there was to of them, then there was him and his sand. A section of the sand broke off, it molded instantly creating ten shuriken forged from his unique sand. He'd extended all of his finger forward, the power of his magnetism propelled these tools forward at a fast pace, two of these shuriken were aimed at the incoming projectiles coming his way, while the remaining four broke its aparent patern, four shuriken went for one clone, while four went for another clone.* - Wed Oct  7 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) smiled as his shuriken were easily knocked aside, as if it was child's play it seemed. His sand reacted on its own, it rose at two sides of the teen, to his left and right hopefully protecting its manipulator against such projectiles. Maybe it was time he'd given his sister a bit of a challenge. The sand continued forward, speading across the battlefield easily it was a lot of sand Tetsumi seemed to be manipulating a feat he wouldn't have been able to do in the past.

Along the sand four clones molded out of the sand, they were spitting images of the manipulator but crafted out of the manipulated material.* - Wed Oct  7 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) each of the clones smiled, they slowly approached Izanami though her lines that they weren't able to detect attached to their bodies. Which would be the downfall end end to these assets of sand, fire ran along the wire destroying each clone down the middle easily. The flames, they'd too reach to Tetsumi's current location.  He didn't expect this for his sister, but it was time to turn the tables on the Ryujin. 

His shield of sand raced forward, out infront of the teen a large shield was crafted from the autmatic defense hoping to keep the flames at bay there before it reached Tetsumi's locatio. His sand continued forward, at this time it'd arrived at Izanami's being. Those same clones of iron sand that she defeated.. Those four were crafted out of the iron sand once more, all four surrounded Izanami at all sides of her. Each spoke in sequence, "Give up?"* - Wed Oct  7 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Hes way too good! - Wed Oct  7 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: I cant find anyone to get past the sand! - Wed Oct  7 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) didn't do anything at all, he'd allow Izanami to cut through the clone. Though the moment she did this it was over, her hand would've been logged or trapped in the clone's being. At this time the four clones burst into iron sand, each clone's being aimed at specific points. One of the clone's sand was aimed at Izanami's legs, while the other aimed at the base of her body, each clone of sand attempted to encase the female completely until it reached to her neck of course. "At least you aren't willing to give up so easily as the other shinobi in this land."* - Wed Oct  7 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I'm proud of ya sis." the teen smiled while giving the female a thumbs up, as he did this the sand fell to the floor lifeless, it was over. Every last inch of the sand returned, so much of it retracting. It soon was forced airborne where it funneled itself back into the teen's gourd, a cork of iron was formed this sealed off the gourd from potential spills or anything entering or exiting it.* - Wed Oct  7 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *nod* Its nothing. - Wed Oct  7 06:47:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "..That's enough for me.." with this thought in his mind, sand spewed from his gourd. This spewed blackened sand quickly changed its form into a rather large hand. This hand if successful would wrap around the manipulator's body.

(Strategem perk) Another portion of the sand was released, this portio of sand formed into another hand, this iron hand grabbed a hold of Alastor's gourd whitch it ripped it apart from the weilder seperating him from his supply..It wasn't as if he was himself, if he was as skilled it'd be an issue in the long run but he was confident in his action. * - Wed Oct  7 19:22:14 2015

The gourd was placed infront of Yan, "Take care of that, lock it up or somethin'." now he'd wait for Fujitora's lead, with the command given the coffin of sand followed behind the teen to the prison.* - Wed Oct  7 19:34:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) had enough of this farmer nonesense from Fujitora, he'd arrived at the police station with the coffin of iron following him behind defying gravity itself. "Mhmm.." his head went from side to side as he examined the interior of the prison.. It looked evil, besides all of the improvement the village had over the years, this seemed trapped in time on moved by it."..Nice..." the teen thought, arriving at Alastor's cell he'd guide the coffin of iron inside. As the door cell's door's shut, every grain of sand retreated from the manipulator's body and back into Tetsumi's gourd where it'd be stored for later use.

"I still don't understand.. his words." for now, he'd shrug it off and leave the area. The threat was detained, he could return to his training.. He'd probably start a heated argument with One'O, even though the beast may have won again..The tanuki yelled for abosolutely no reason, though it probably was his nature.* - Wed Oct  7 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) as he left the prison, a guard came meeting him at the entrance, "Mhmm?" the teen questioned.

If possibly the guard would continue down the stair case, meeting up with the woman named Zenaki and conveying the message.* - Wed Oct  7 19:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "While I relax, I guess i'll spy on those two, ehehe." the teen extended his right hand outward while his left covered both of his eyes. His body leaned up against the house contructed of sand. He channeled chakra to both of his hands for specific reason. His right converted the gathered chakra into sand..iron sand that the teen manipulated. The sand was molded into a bird of sand, it resembled one of the native birds seen in the dessert and around sunagakure. Though it lacked sight, its eye sockets were blank for just a moment before being filled with sand. The right hand attached the nerves in his eyes to the artificial eyes being formed. 

With his sight transfered over to the bird it took flight, it flew high into the sky in the direction of the village's gate. Both of Tetsumi's hand dropped to his side, though both eyes remained closed, his version was warped to the birds for the time being.* - Wed Oct  7 20:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) a bird landed right next to the teen, "Mhmm?" from the direction where it flew from it looked as if it came from inside of the village. The teen bent down undoing the scroll it carried, he'd unravel the scroll its contents now revealed to him."Wahh.." the teen questioned, he crushed the paper a bit ticked off.

He'd shot out of the guards a glance before he left, "Watch her, if she tries to get in don't hesitate to kill." with that he'd walk away from the area while gathering chakra. The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. The iron cork on his gourd undid itself, releasing the desired amount of iron sand from within. It formed below his feet becoming dense before it launched skyward towards the area the scroll specified. 

While he left, it had guards on the walls, plus at the gate eyes trained on the female they were obeying the Jounin's command.* - Thu Oct  8 00:51:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) arrived on the scene by air, though it seemed as if he arrived a little too late. All he witnessed was Hassan preparing handseals, wind kicked up, dust mixed in with sand clouded his vision of the situation below."Mhmm..Its finished?" though on his way here he'd caught sight of a body."..Death.." a sigh was released from the teen's figure.

Though he'd lost control of his train of thought, below on top of a sandy house he heard his sister's voice."Yo." the teen waved, it seemed as if she wanted to accompany him above. One of his hands were extended out, prompting a section of his sand to break off forming a single platform for the young shinobi, this platform would soon morph with his, becoming a single one.* - Thu Oct  8 01:53:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) decended from the skies alongside Izanami. The platform of iron that gifted the two with flight funneled itself back into his gourd. An iron cork formed from the remainder of the material, which placed itself on top of the gourd sealing off the top."Mhmm.. All right." his eyes focused on the deceased boy, he was way younger than himself..Probably about Izanami's age or older, it was the faith of darkness within shinobi and shinobi or anyone in general..
