If this was sucessfull, it'd consume his body until it reached his neck. Once done, he'd will the coffin of iron over towards the tree, there the iron sand further wrapped itself around the tree for extra support in keeping him contained so Reguel could work on him.

The sand beckoned to the emotions raging on inside of the teen, an eruption of blackened sand, iron sad was seen from the jounin's gourd.

His hands contorted into various hand gestures willing the large mass or gathering of iron sand. It swepted over the area, rather large hands were molded out of the iron sand  two in total. These two arms of iron sand raced forward for Mirai and Madelyn as well. The first was focused for Mirai hoping to pull her away, the second one was focused on Madelyn. These hands of iron hand would grab each of them at their mid section hopefully preventing them from attacking any further.

(Strategem Perk) Once done, more iron sand was fed into the large arms as it began to spread along their bodies until it reached up to their necks. Once done he'd step forward. "This is finished, you two are family." he'd shot a glance towards Madelyn while saying."Calm down hun." his voice was calm, though he seemed rather serious, a side that most hadn't seen of the jounin.* - Fri Oct 23 23:28:00 2015
