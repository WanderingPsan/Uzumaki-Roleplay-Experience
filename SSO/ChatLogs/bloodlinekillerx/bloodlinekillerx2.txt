<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) pulls down Evan's pants, slowly. As Evan's pants hit the ground, Mizuki would bite his lip to conseal his laughter. Mizuki's left eyebrow would rise as he was faced to face with what seemed to be a misplaced ramen noodle. As he shrugged his shoulders slightly, he'd grasp the noodle tightly, parting his lips. He would then slowly insert the noodle into his mouth, jerking his head back and forth for about a good two minutes before a creamy white substance bursted from the tip of the ramen noodle, sending the baby-juice into Mizuki's mouth.*

He'd then bite down onto his thumb swiftly, breaking the skin causing a small amount of blood to pour from the wound. Mizuki would then exclaim, "Summoning jutsu!". He would then form a chain of handseals before slamming his left hand onto the ground, causing an enormous cloud of white smoke to form as a giagantic slug crashed through the ground, sending chunks of rock flying everywhere. Mizuki would smile brightly as he exclaimed, "Yeah! I did it!". He would then leap from atop the slug's head saying, "Well...why don't we get to this sage training.".*

Mizuki would then dart toward the slug, leaping onto it's head. He'd thrust his right hand onto the center of it's head, causing the giant slug to break down into much smaller slugs, each slamming into the ground leaving small crater's from the force of their impacts. Mizuki would then form a chain of handsigns exclaiming, "Collaboration Jutsu!: Bursting Acid Collision Waves!". He'd then form a chain of handseals before slamming his hand onto one of the much smaller slug's heads. The slug would inhale deeply before spitting out a large wave of it's acidic liquid, using transfered water chakra from Mizuki.*

<br><font color=green>*Cratike(Bloodline Killer X) says: (Brb)
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) clasps, "Death...why does it always have to be death?.." the teen questioned himself in his mind. At this time both of his hands slipped into his pockets, he didn't feel safe especially with his siblings around in the village."..Mhmm..I'll scout the village." with that, he brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body clasping his hands.

Tetsu gathered chakra, the gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces enabling his magnetic field. A hand gesture was made, causing the iron cork on his gourd to slacken once removed iron sand seeped out from the gourd's contents. A few more hand gestures were made, causing the matterial to shape itslef and become rather dense infront of the teen. It levitated infront of the teen, high enough for a single leep for him to mount the suspended iron transportation. And that he did, Tetsumi jumped on to the iron platform as it slowly rose up towards the sky drifting away.

"Mhmm..Can't allow for em' to hurt." he'd think on his younger siblings for a moment. He only cared about their safety mainly, the village just a tiny bit since there were small children just like them."I'll protect you all." at that time the teen drifted out of sight.* - Sun Aug 30 21:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) surveyed the areafrom below, "I won't get any progress from here." the child sighed, it seemed that he was the one usually on patrol duty lately. Though it wasn't anyone's fault but his own in reality, he wanted his siblings to be safe so this was the price to be kept..along with a small amount of the civilians to be safe..Mainly the children, the adults that treated him like shit for the past four years could burn, get merked, maimed, whatever it'd cost for them to finally perish for their crimes against him and other sand manipulators that died in those bloody days. 

"Mhmm..Its too dark to determine from below of any potential threats." Tetsu had to react fast, he didn't take the predicament of sunagaure lightly. They were at an all time low in the history of his village that he was aware of. He'd brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body clasping his hands, the teen gathered begun to concentrate focusing on gathering chakra. The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. 

The teen made a hand gesture, causing the cork to slacken it'd remove it'd look as if it removed itself. Out of the gourd iron sand slithered out from its confinement, though just the amount he needed for the technique in mind. His hand flowed easily as he formed a couple hand gestures causing the iron sand conjured to form into a platform for him to mount on. Thus that happened, to the point that the sand became rather dense as well. A little hop was made as he made his way on to the levitating platform of iron, another hand gesture was made causing the platform to take off towards the night sky..

"Odd.." he paused for a moment to awknowleadge the moon, it shined down on him embracing him with its light. Quickly he'd look away from it as a cold breeze past by, it was rather cold on this dessert night.* - Mon Aug 31 21:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm?...Who's.." the teen questioned scouting from above, he hovered over the village..Not much civilians were out since it was night time, but easily judging by the silver hair..it most likely belonged to his sister Izanami. "Mhmm..Wonder why she's out this hour." Tetsu mumbled to himself from above, the girl was on a lone bench all alone by herself."It..It won't hurt to check up on her for just a minute or two.." with that, he'd command the platform of iron to lower down towards his baby sister.

"Yo..wassup?" the teen questioned, arms folded as he registered her figure. Checking if she was hurt, crying anything. If any of the above were an issue, he'd kill someone. Tetsumi was a protective elder brother once in the mood, plus he felt like he wanted an excuse to kill someone, odd... The platform remained levitated, he wanted to work on the mastery of the technique after all. Why not work on that while talk? It'd probably contribute to his control and focus somewhere down the line.* - Mon Aug 31 21:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) arms remained crossed against his chest area..."Mhmm..I see. That's the reason." his eyes trailed off elsewhere for a moment though still remembering to keep the shape of the platform and chakra flow which kept him a float from submerging down towards the natural sands of the village. "Y-You shouldn't be all alone by yourself. Anythin' could happen in these times." he always seemed to be the guy of the bearer of bad news but...it had to be said."Can't Fu-Pops, help you out with your fire trainng?" he'd ask a bit concerned, maybe with him around it would lessen the potential danger for her.

"He'd better be around, else i'll be huntin' him next.." went through his mind, but on the outside he had a gentle smile on his face displayed.* - Mon Aug 31 22:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shot Dravae a death glance the moment he spoke, it meant a lot of things like 'who the hell asked for your incentive' then focused back on his kid sister. The glance in question became rather lax and nicer in comparison to the one a couple secounds ago. "I-I see. I'll speak to him." really didn't have an issue with consulting with Fuji about Izanami's future, training, etc. They disagreed on certain points but that was apart of a step son step father roll. But he knew how it felt to have neither parents around, though she was more fortunate since she at least had Fuji around..His links to his true family were severed early thanks to the wars waged in the past by sunagakure against the world litterally..He couldn't allow for the girl to tread down a dark path, their still was light for her...light that dampened his blood lust at times.

Though finding himself mostly focusing on his sister the platform made a sudden dip downwards but Tetsu reacted quickly and focused on the output of chakra and reapplied density of his platform keeping him a float..he'd snicker a bit uneasy as he regained the same comfortable altitude as before."Well..if that's all right with you that is." either way he'd speak to the man, but he wanted to hear her response on what it seemed he'd be doing. "Your children comes first before anythin'." the child thought, for a moment reflecting on his parents before their demise.* - Mon Aug 31 22:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) heard Dravae's words, his eyes switched for a moment trying to process the man's insults and threats. A smile formed on his face, he bearly fought back the urge of gutting him right here in the night streets of sunagakure. Though their was one thing he had to put into account and think about, his sister..She was right here, he wouldn't maime anyone around her or his other siblings as long as he could've helped it. Instead of hyping on the situation or sticking it around until it was out of his control, he decided it'd be his leave..He had to play the mature roll for this moment, with out another word he'd make a hand gesture causing the platform of iron to rise into the night sky. 

The teen was now bound for elsewhere around the village, his eyes remained on the look out for anything out of the ordinary..He coudln't waste his time on him, especially since he was a bit cranky from the lack of sleep.* - Mon Aug 31 22:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Humph..Its best I take a break..I've patrolled for..for like forever.." the teen was overeacting but everything seemed be like eons passed in his terms. With another hand gesture made, he ushered the platform elsewhere..It was the bugs turn, as well as the remaining guards of sunagkure (If their were any left.) to do their jobs. He always returned when everyone slept or when his family were getting ready to leave, he'd release a sigh and continue on through the skies until spotting his house. Once in sight, Tetsu lowered the platform of iron until it grounded with the sand's below his feet.  

Walking away from the grounded iron, he'd make another hand gesture which worked to funnel the matterial back into his gourd. It'd also form a cork out of the matterial, the cork itself was fixed at the top of the gourd sealing off the hole from potential spills. Inside, it was dark..his siblings slept but Fuji wasn't around."Wonder where he's at?.." the child questioned before finding himself a soft spot in the corner of the room. There he'd sit, legs crossed like a monk, hands brought up to the mid-section of his body clasping them, both eyes closed, as the teen meditated..This helped him a lot on a mental level to find sort of stabability, calmness, all of that nice stuff. Within the dark and warmth of the house, a silent smile was on his face as he tried to clear his mind to reach a higher level of peace.* - Tue Sep 01 00:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body, clasping his hands he gathered chakra converting it into magnetic forces. With his magnetic field in play he made a hand gesture causing the iron cork on his gourd to slacken removing itself from a top the iron container. Another command was made, prompting iron sand to flow out of the gourd up and over the teen in a controlled form and density. He formed a platform of iron sand, leeped on to it and ascended up towards the heavens on patrol once more.* - Tue Sep 01 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was in the sky, just chilling.* - Tue Sep 01 21:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) quite didn't like the idea of a 'Bomb' especially around his little sister whom was in the area. If it was a lie or not, their had to be a price he didn't think much lightly when it came to sunagakure especially in these times. he observed from above the attempt made to flee herself from Osamu. He'd focus his eyes on Osamu before saying, "Move." with a hand gesture made, Iron sand erupted from the teen's gourd in a downward arch for Maya's body. Bomb or not, he needed to get to the bottom of this, if it meant stripping the cloak off or killing her in the process..Hell he'd have to do that.* - Tue Sep 01 22:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) once the sand was able to even meet up with Maya's body, he'd make another hand gesture causing the iron sand to bombard her body, wrapping around her entire body except her nose (She had to breath)..He had to keep her alive, even if the urges he felt wanted otherwise. 

If sucessful, he'd slowly decend from above on the platform that he rode on. * - Tue Sep 01 22:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm...Maybe she doesn't have a bomb?" went through the teen's mind, either way it had to be helped. Another hand gesture was made, it parted the sand from her mouth region but kept the sand covering her eyes closed. "What's the bomb do you speak of?" the teen questioned Maya, hell the people should be glad Tetsu was a talker in this situation versus previous situations of late...* - Tue Sep 01 22:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Oh..." he'd blink twice for a moment of silence.."You should choose your words wisely..My bad." with that, he'd recall the sand, every last grain of the matterial back into his gourd. It'd funnel back into it though a little bit of it remained forming a cork to seal off the hole a top the gourd from potential spills.* - Tue Sep 01 22:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) if no one else decided to do anything, he'd be off the situation became rather awkward."Mhmm? Fear? This village has endured a lot, threats are to be dealt with for the safety of the remaining civilians..especially the kids." * - Tue Sep 01 22:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) hearing Kronos's name, he felt as if he was shot in his heart..That name, it brought a lot of pain for sunagakure. The teen focused on the sand manipulator he hadn't seen in ages."The hell are you here?!" his hands folded across his chest, a murderous stare focused on him.* - Wed Sep 02 00:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) wasn't really sure what Kronos meant by 'that thing', did he actually know about that other thing? It was over his head nore he cared enough to dwell on that at the moment. He'd close his eyes for a moment of silence for Tategama after witnessing his old pupil's kazekage garb and ambu mask both stained with his dried blood. "What could you possibly bring to the village both pain and more death?" yes kronos was once his dearest friend, but the actions that he did..He couldn't allow such a thing to live in the village while his siblings lived.

"...." he'd remain quiet fighting against the urges that lingered in his mind for Kronos's actions. He'd release a sigh, self control he'd try to get a better grip at everytime he'd been meditating for the past four years.* - Wed Sep 02 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) held his head for a moment, focusing skyward he'd speak to himself invisioning speaking with kastya at this time for some form of guidance."What should I do about him?" the him he was refering to was Kronos, he didn't trust him ever since the actions he'd made as a proposed 'hero' who's activities didn't warant it at all. The plan that kastya and himself in regards to Kronos was that they'd capture and place him in prison..But the man had caused to much pain, he threaded closer to darkness at every step, closer than himself and at times it wasn't his doing. "Ughh. The hell should I do?!" both hands were extended skyward at the heavens demanding an answer.

Of course their wasn't an answer to be given but could his heart point him in the right direction? Yes Kronos had good intentions or ideals, but how could he have trusted him? He believed it was far to late for a change of heart, but should he deal with him? Or let him follow through with his plans, possibly allow his village to be legal once more but would it come with the price of -him- leading sunagakure? He didn't care much for the place at this point, especially how Tategama give in so easily to kumogakure. That event alone pissed him off since he'd been fighting for sunagakure for so many years, witnessed so many deaths for the village to be given in so easily plus it ended in his demise that Kronos himself caused. Though maybe if everything went well..his siblings wouldn't continue their early lifes in poverty. He'd sigh, maybe sometimes he had to back down and suppress his own feelings so his love ones could florish?

Snapping out of his train of thought he'd look around for a moment. Their were kids playing in the sand, despite their ragged garbs and unpleasant looks. They were quite happy with each other, some were a bit underweight due to the lack of food. He'd sigh, a thought was left in his mind a decision he made. Tetsumi brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body gathering chakra. The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. The iron cork on his gourd slackened removing itself from the container, once removed iron sand slithered from its container. Hand gestures were made, prompting the iron sand to gather below his feet becoming rather dense as he formed of platform of iron. Another gesture was made, causing the platform to raise into the air. Once at the desired height, the teen patrolled from above in his own way securing the children of his village from potential harm.* - Wed Sep 02 20:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) finished with patrolling for now he'd slowly decend down towards an isolated area so he could've trained in peace just for a moment even. Landing on the sand's below, he funneled the iron utilized in his platform back ino his gourd. At this time, inside his gourd the matterial mixed thanks to his control and chakra within the matterial. An image was placed in his mind as he formed a hand gesture, causing iron sand to spew from the gourd up out and down infront of him. As it made contact with the sand out infront of him, it formed a replica a clone out of the sand."All right, you're the first. How much do I got in me." At that time he gathered chakra building up for the next clone.* - Wed Sep 02 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) formed a hand gesture, prompting the iron sand to form a platform of iron below his feet. The platform became dense on his command, able to with stand his weight. Another gesture was made rocketing him skyward to patrol the village.* - Wed Sep 02 20:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stayed in the sky above on a platform of iron, hopefully out of reach of Zetsumo's combo of wind and fire. Either way if it came to that, his sand would've protected him if he truely was in any danger or he'd move out of the way. He had to look at the battle from a strategic point of view, he had past experiences from numerous wars it was better he hadn't squandered his chakra reservers stupidly but then again he had plenty incase in room for potential fuck ups.

He'd brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body gathering chakra. Iron sand spewed out of the gourd and gathered skyward above the troops. Though he kept a good amount on his person, for defensive pourposes and other means if it came to that. It just looked like a gray cloud above the group.* - Wed Sep 02 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Guess I bring the rain." the teen snickered. At this moment he made a hand gesture outward. Above Zetsumo's troops from his previous turn, a black cloud of iron sand loomed above. At this time the sand changed shape into kunai, all at once all of the kunai formed in the air plummeted from above down at the trops from an aerial prospective.

If this went well, it would make his plan a lot more easier.* - Wed Sep 02 22:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widened as the gas was spewed from the beast that wore the blazing red mask."SHIT!" escaped his mouth, he'd seen the technique before. Hell it was utilized on him before thanks to Nautica way back then, but most likely it was WAY stronger in comparison to his use. On its own iron sand erupted from his gourd attempting to form a complete shield of iron sand around the boy like a dome in the sky above (hopefully how high he was up and the gas or ash being sent in his direction took a little bit more time before it was ignited..Giving his shield enough time to protect him). 

Once in the dome protecting him, he'd make a hand gesture hopefully manipulating the dome that protected him skyward. Well if the dome held true to its defensive capabilites and held together. But skyward away from more threats so he could've made a new plan.* - Wed Sep 02 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (Yeaaah. My nin/CC is broken. I think ur gonna get wrecked, but you can rp having enough strength to retreat at least - Thu Sep 03 00:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) it was ignited 'BOOM' was heard from the heaven's as flames challenged the iron defenses wrath.."N-No.." cracks were seen stretching along the iron dome's surface. It'd breach, there weren't any doubts about it. To defend against the impending flames, the teen utilized his armor to take some of the dammage. From the pouches around his waist, it'd gather infront of Tetsu hoping to futher brace the flames.

And at this time all he saw was red, as flames beated down against his body. A cry of pain was heard in the sky above as he plummeted downward somewhere up the cliff side -if- he fell all the way down.* - Thu Sep 03 00:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) body fell from the sky above, his eyes remained opened his body ached. Every fiber of it yelled out in pain from the previous dammage done to him. From above, his eyes and mind registered everything that he could've seen taking place...Especially one in particular that caught his attention, Kronos being impalled b earth.."No.." it was true it cursed at the man for the actions he had done..but he was close to him afterall..back..way back from the time the two were in the academy together, on missions..Back in the good old days since Jak's rule. "K-Kronos.." his eyes flared up with anger, something else sparked within, the voices became rather louder. A tear trailed from the side of his face, "D-Don't leave me..alone."

At this time he noticed something, an individual popped up from below attempting to grab his body. Nope, he wasn't going to allow that. For a moment he invisioned Jak, Adhara, Savae, Kastya, Izashim, all of those dearest to him that were now deceased. His voice would've been heard. "UGGRURRGHH!!!!!!" thundered in the sky above, iron sand and additional sand erupted from his gourd, it'd cover half of the teen's body giving him a monstrous physice and chakra along with it.

Swinging his massive hand of sand, it extended outward for Kronos's body..* - Thu Sep 03 01:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) didn't even care much for the cage being conjured around him, in no time a cage of steel incased him. His main concern was Kronos, "Why..is it..." his hands shot up to his head for a moment his train of thought was lost..All he saw was death, death was what the beast wanted over everything..In his massive arm Kronos laid in its embrace."DEATHHHHHH!!!!" a monstrous voice cursed, it was Tetsumi's but it wasn't like him. He was enraged yes, but he remained in the cage for the time being, Iron sand began to gather as if manipulated by his rage.* - Thu Sep 03 02:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) closed his eyes, his body shook for a moment. Grain on grain of sand rang out in his ears. Half of his body still remained its monstrous hue, now his attention was focused on the dome that container him. Utilizing the gathered sand,  it'd become rather dense as it began to swirl..The swirling drill of iron was focused on the wall behind of him, Kronos's lifeless body still in his grasp. The sound of massive drilling was heard from within and outside as the beast attempted to flee with the body. In his mind, he wanted to pursue after Zetsumo and his army. That was his focus, the man had to die..him and his henchment that caused the severing of sunagakure and his friend's death.* - Thu Sep 03 02:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) drill finally penetrated the cage that contained him, leaving a rather sized hole in its wake. As much sand as he could've willed into the gourd, is what he did. The left over? He wouldn't get anywhere on his two feet, he was rather slow in this form..He had a rather one track mind at the moment, killing zetsumo, his henchmen, hell whomever even got in his way on his way there. Manipulating the iron at his feet, he'd surf on the remaining sand using it for transportation methods. In the blink of an eye, Tetsumi surfed out free. Free to roam and seek revenge, he even travelled at a faster pace than usual while riding the sand..* - Thu Sep 03 03:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued roaming the dessert, his heart full of utter rage. Though rage had to die at one point, especially with out anyone to take it out on..Zetsumo on his group were long gone, as well as anyone in sight. He stopped in his tracks, his head looking at the darkened sky above..It felt his pain as well, why did he has to lose so much? The voices slowly retreated to the farthest reaches of his mind for the moment. The shroud of sand fell to the ground, littering all around him with iron particles. He'd look down at Kronos's body, which now laid on the dessert floor a bright smile on his face."You're free to be with Savae and the others now..I'm going to avenge you." tears flowed from his eye sockets, as if the heaven's truely felt it, it began to rain. 

"I'll kill him..but..I can't do it alone." he'd look at his hands, his right hand holding his chest..The rage he felt..the beast..he needed its assistance to accomplish his revenge. He couldn't do it alone, the man even almost took him out in one move utilizing those beasts that wore those masks of varrying colors.
The teen wasn't sure how, but he was going to tame this beast's power...though that was something he had to venture along into down the line, he wasn't strong enough to tame such a power..He realized this, in just a second he couldn't control himself, he wanted vengence..blood.

"I'll bury you along Savae and mother (kastya) in the village. T-That's..the least that I can do." with that, he'd conjure the iron that remained. His body ached..but he formed a two person platform of one below him and the body. On his command, they'd rise into the air...The rain's embrace was felt, drip after drip washing over him."Are you crying?..Kronos?" the teen asked as the platform travered through the skies of the storming dessert.* - Thu Sep 03 03:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) while traveling to his village, the thought crossed his mind."What..What did they want with his body?.." the child wasn't sure and he wasn't going to allow Kronos's body to fall in the wrong hands..Why would they want his body? It couldn't be a good reason for this, it pained him..but he had to do what was right for the future. He'd lower the platform of iron towards the ground, he'd take his belongings. Like his sand for instance, maybe he'd bury that instead in his place. Yup, he'd follow through with this idea. Taking the gourd of sand, he'd place it on the platform. 

Saddness creeped up on him once more, he'd take out ten explosive tags and tagged every inch of his body with them. Forming a hand seal, the tags ignited. "...." he wouldn't say another word as he soared into the sky above, the man's gourd along with him. In the distance, an explostion was heard destroying the body that belonged to Kronos..His heart sank for a moment but he knew it was for the best. What pieces remained if any would've been consumed by the critters of sunagakure's dessert. 

Arriving in the village, he lowered his platform of sand near his mother's savae his younger brother, Jak, Seto, Izashim, and the other fallen sunagakure shinobi in the past. Utilizing his sand, he formed shovels out of the sand and dug away until finding a deep enough hole. A stream of sand carried and lowered the gourd into the grave."This'll be your body, it'll remain in earthly peace with everybody." with that, he covered over the hole. Later a thombstone was placed that red, "Here lies a Hero, despite his past triumphed over darkness and defended his home -Kronos." a smile formed on his face before leaving the scene.* - Thu Sep 03 04:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) paced back and fourth around the village, there was heavy dammage. A result of zetsumo's attack, he'd release a sigh from within. Was again death and another war plagued suna. For how much longer would they suffer, it pissed him off how strong the man truely was. With out much thought, he was defeated by the man and lost a friend in the assault. It was time to put down his foot for a change, instead of cowering in all honestly..afraid of what truely dwelled within him.  He already came to the conclustion after losing so much, it was a continual cycle. Him losing, death, saddness, anger. But he was far from succumbing to these circumstances, he was strong at mind and heart and none of his dearest ones that he lost would've wanted to see him in a depressive state.

He'd brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body, clasping his hands he gathered chakra. The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. At this time the iron cork from his gourd slackened, followed by the sound of his special sand escaping from its prison. Manipulated into the form he had in mind, the sand gathered under his feet, forming a platform of iron for aerial transportation for him. Rising into the air he'd head off into an isolated area within the village most likely at one of the highest structures. Tetsu eyes came across a piece of the walls of sunagakure that remained from the assault, there he'd land and begin his training. The sand was manipulated back into his gourd, the cork once again placed at top of the gourd sealing it off from potential spills and escape of the matterial.

All by himself, it seemed so but he had a different ideal of this. To him he wasn't alone, everyone that passed and played a vital role in his heart watched over him..They were there watching him, not physically but spiritually. He motioned towards the ground, positioning himself into a meditative stance even bringing both hands together attempting to clear his mind gathering chakra through out his body. "HEY! I KNOW YOU'RE THERE! SHOW YOURSELF!" the teen yelled in his mind. Attempting to connect with the thing or awaken it from deep within..He had to get his point across, even though it might've been meaningless. "One day...One day...I'll quell your hate and blood lust, and tame your power. I'm not afraid anymore, i've suffered for far to long..being powerless, hopeless. I won't travel that road any longer..fear only beckons weakness. YOU HEAR ME, I'M NOT AFRAID!" he wasn't sure if it heard his words or not, either way he got it off of his chest. Now, with the people he lost the continue to foster his loneliness..the chunk missing from his heart, their sacrifices and beliefs were going to carry the teen through out the remainder of his life. May it be brief or a fruitful one, he'd open his eyes controlling his breathing for a moment.* - Fri Sep 04 00:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) hands reamined idle in his pockets, venturing towards the village's gate alongside Ikarus he'd noticed Dravae who seemed to be hurting. He'd release a sigh after hearing his story, but what could the teen do? If Dravae's story added up, it was wrong but he was weak and it'd result in more blood shed, more suffering for sunagakure."First, i'll follow through." he thought within, hoping whom he intended for it to hear heard it. "Dravae, what could we do for you before we head out?" he sounded a bit concerned, but his face remained emotionless.* - Fri Sep 04 19:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) paused for a moment hearing Dravae's question.."I..I needed some time for myself." what exactly could he have said, he was so worked up after Kronos's passing that he ventured off after the enemy but couldn't? On top of that the state that he was in? It wasn't the best example he showed, which is why he had to begin to find himself."If you're all right, just heal yourself up. There is a mission we need to complete." tried to keep his old outward apperances in check, but this contributed to his cause. He had to get a better grasp, even mastering its power so sunagakure could flourish.* - Fri Sep 04 19:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) movement stoped the moment Ikarus stoped, "Mhmm?" the teen questioned. His eyes tried to make out exactly what Ikarus was talking about, his eye sight wasn't the best but it got the job done. Eventually the small figures, was these really the creatures? What ever it was approached at a fast pace, instead of questioning this he brought both hands up to the mid-section of his body clasping them gathering chakra. The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. At this moment, the iron cork from his gourd shot into the air, making way for a plume of iron sand that erupted from the gourd, the cork it to converted back into iron sand and joined the sand summoned fourth.* - Fri Sep 04 19:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Well..Guess i'll try to stop the fast one's movement. Just wack it!" with that, the teen made a hand gesture that willed the iron sand causing it to spread along the dessert's sand, covering it like a top layer. The sand continued to spread out hoping the meet the jaguar or the other two whenever they might've met up with the sand. * - Fri Sep 04 20:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) wasn't planning to bring back in the jaguar that Ikarus managed to clubber with his hammer. A smile appeared on the teen's face, "Air or by ground, you'll surely meet your end!" snickered at the end. At this time he made a hand gesture, causing the iron sand to burst, rocketing upward hoping to cut off one of the jaguar's that attempting to pounch at the group. The moment the sand smashed into its body he'd make another hand gesture, causing the sand to wrap around the beast an emotionless experession worn on his face. He hadn't an issue with this type of action being made, for one they were attacking and killing innocent people and he thought of this as training, it was a win win situation.* - Fri Sep 04 21:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) decided to commence his next action, his left palm was open aimed at the jaguar trapped in his sand..At this time, he noticed something rather large jump in the corner of his eye. Reacting to this, the teen closed his opened palm crushing the jaguar to death with ease. Blood of the beast showered on the once brown sand, giving it a bloody color red sand.

His mind worked quickly to devise a plan in that instant, with an understanding of what had to be done he leaped backwards raising the sand a bit. As the impact was made it sent vibrations through the sand, knocking him off his feet and backwards. For protection pourposes his sand moved on its own, bracing his fall, once laying on the sand the teen had enough playing with these beasts.

"Okay, you want to play like that? OKAY!" the teen returned such a favour, the displaced sand, at the speeds that he managed to improve over the years formed sharp spikes that rammed itself into the large beast's chest area hopefully being done with it at this instant. More blood stained his iron, a pissed off expression worn on his face.* - Fri Sep 04 22:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) laughed a bit reacting to Ikarus's comment, "I appreciate it." blood, evidence of the respected animals being slayed. He'd shrug his shoulder, turning around. Before leaving the area completely he'd make a hand gesture, causing the iron sand to gather above funneling itseld back into the gourd. A little bit of the sand was left behind, that part of the sand formed an iron cork out of it which was placed at the top of his gourd sealing off the sand from potential spills. "Guess we're out." came from the teen as he left the group first, his hands were placed in his pockets, his head head at an angle that gazed at the sun as it beamed down on him with its harsh rays.* - Sat Sep 05 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sees his step father, death stares."You...!"* - Sat Sep 05 00:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) breaks apart from the formation the group held, he'd take two steps forward."Next time you up and vanish, i'll kill you next." to Fuji and Tetsu, it didn't mean much..Just how they bonded.* - Sat Sep 05 00:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) folded his arms and pouted slightly, "Ain't any excuse I want to hear. Plus you know I don't stay home much, have to stay moving..ehehe.." Fuji knew the reason why, his insomnia was rather troublesome.* - Sat Sep 05 00:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm?" turns around to face Aiyana.* - Sat Sep 05 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) rose an eye brow questioning Fuji."Eh?..." either way he'd step forward, but he wasn't getting his gourd.* - Sat Sep 05 01:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) recieved his seperate cart that contained various fuuinjutsu seals that Fuji concocted himself. "Uh huh...so just spread them outside along the sands to the vilage?" the teen questioned for clarification. Either way he'd prep himself, he had to work fast so things could've went a lot smoothly. Tetsu clasped his hands gathering chakra, the gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces enabling his magnetic field. He'd observe both of them utilzing clones to make things get accomplish quicket yet easier at the same time. "Ehh..I can do that too." plus, it was good practice for what he aimed for being quicket combining techniques and quicker response timing.

The iron cork from his gourd was slackened, it shot up into the air as iron sand escaped his gourd. The cork to converted back into iron sand, mixing back in with the grains and grains of iron powder. He'd make a hand gesture, causing two plumes of the sand to seperate. On seperation it'd begin to form into clones of Tetsu. Two clones of iron was made and another step had to be made, but their was a delay between this that he had to work on.

"HUMPH!" he'd branch off another section of his sand, allowing the broken of section of it to form platform for the clones and himself. He divided the contents of the cart between himself and the clones. "We're ready." the replied, his vast amount of chakra not dented as much by this use chakra.* - Sat Sep 05 01:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) after recieving his orders, he turned to his clones of iron and departed. Each clones divided from the original on their own platform of sand. Each clone and Tetsu himself carried an amount of Fuji's seals to be place on the walls of sunagakure and on the sands of the dessert as instructed..Only because of the village he hadn't rammed heads and argued with his step father as usual, such a routined child like act of his. 

Iron Sand Clone One: Went about his buisness, as designated he placed the tags given to him along the walls of sunagakure where they weren't any placed from either Fuji or Dravae.

Iron Sand Clone Two: Traversed at a lower height, closer to the dessert's sand below. It pin pointed places where it had to place each and every fuuinjutsu box and seals etc along the designated area in the dessert Fuji instructed.

Tetsumi did the same from above, he'd do the others jobs while they did theirs. While one worked on one side of a wall he worked on the other side of the wall. While one worked on the sands setting up and stashing the boxes he'd help out as well in the efforts. It was at this time he ascended skyward once more for a final sweep. At this time, he felt it.."Mother?.." the child questioned, it felt as if he was shot..He felt a tug in his stomach, it was the beast reacting to the chakra..last time it sensed that chakra, it hijacked the boy's body and had a grudge match with kastya herself. He'd shake off this feeling, "Its in my head." the image he had of kastya vanished from view as he got a grip of himself.

Eventually, all of the seals given to him and his clones were placed and burried deep enough and covered over...ehh...good enough. His attitude seemed to be a bit deperessed for a moment, since the clones were finished with their jobs. The two returned levitating on a platform back to the original. "Mhmm.." both clones burst into sand, the platfrom itself gave way. But before falling towards the ground below, Tetsu manipulated the iron back into his gourd. Slowly, he'd decend from above. 

Once landing, the iron utilized in the platform technique was to recalled to his gourd. A little bit of the matterial was left behind forming the cork, that was then placed at the top of the gourd preventing possible spills.* - Sat Sep 05 02:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: (Ninja Rank) - Sat Sep 05 02:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stretched his legs, he'd begin to walk over to the two bug tamers, Dravae and Zehl. "He's about to do something, very stupid.." went through Tetsu's mind, he'd walk past them when in air shot he'd mumble something."Don't do nothin' stupid." this was refered to Dravae and Zehl, mostly Dravae. After this, he'd leave the scene maybe to meditate somemore off somewhere.* - Sat Sep 05 03:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) found a still yet quiet place in the village, he needed enough room to cencentrate. This area was the ideal place, it wasn't the same place he'd went previously but it was as good. It was quiet and lacked as much people in the area since after the attack by Zetsumo himself. Motioning towards the sand below, the teen fixed himself into a meditative stance. The teen closed his eyes, now it was only him and darkness itself he'd attempt to clear his mind. 

Thought this time, he'd come with a nicer approach to get the beast's attention."I know you're there. You don't have to ignore me, I have your presence and i'm aware you know of mine..Hell you threatened me in the past...What i'm getting at here is, we're stuck together. Why not f-" the teen was cut off by laughter of the beast..nothing more or less, no conversation made. 

That pissed him off, at this point..he didn't care if it was the beast he was talking to. He'd snap piping up, "SHUT UP! Let me speak for a change. I may be a fool, worthless, spineless, all of those things you've called me in the past along with reeking hovic if I doozed off. We're stuck together, I refuse to live the rest of my sleep deprised days in fear and conflict. If you don't see it now, you will in the future, i've lost to much to be afraid of you." at that time, his eyes flew open breaking the weak connection he had. He'd release a sigh, instead of atempting to argue once more.. Tetsu instead closed his eyes and continued to meditate, maybe he'd try later.* - Sat Sep 05 03:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) clasps his hands gathering chakra, the gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. "Things are becoming a bit hostile.." the teen thought, their were arguments in the streets of sunagkure. He'd release a sigh, the iron cork was removed from the gourd and converted back into iron powder, its grains joined the amount of sand released from the gourd. On his command the ideal amount of sand he'd needed formed under his feet even becoming a bit dense to support his weight. The iron platform rose into the air, above the village he had a clear view of it, the choas taking place."Why are they arguing?", Tetsu slid a hand under his chin, basicaly from the skies observing with a slight intrest in the matter.* - Sat Sep 05 18:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looks down from above noticing Orakuru, "Mhmm?" the teen questioned, he heard but to better understand he'd decend a little lower.* - Sat Sep 05 19:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "If anythin' else, try and get my attention. I need to continue patrolling and training as well." with that, the platform of iron slowly rose higher back into the air departing from Orakuru.* - Sat Sep 05 19:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued patrolling the village, ideas flowed through his mind..He had to put two and two together, but he needed more information on the battlefiled, things like the state of the battle field how many tropps, information on the terrain..He all ready knew about the sensor from the previous attack, that he had a fix for through his friend Dravae. Pieces were slowly coming into place, "Mhmm.." was heard from the teen as he slowly decended off somewhere around the village.

Once landing he'd walk off of the platform of iron, the iron utilized in the platform broke apart. The sand levitated in the air, more sand was summoned fourth from his gourd. He'd make some hand gestures, prompting the sand to break into three sections. Each section began molding into clones of the teen. With the clones creation their was a pause between Tetsu's actions..He had to work on this.  Another plume of iron was manipulated out of the gourd, controlled by Tetsu. Manipulating the sand he'd make hand gesture causing the sand to bombard one of the clones, the sand begining to wrap around it restricting movement and escape. Their was another pause before even attempting to follow through with the finishing blow. His palm was open for a moment before he forcefully closed it tightning his grip. This caused the sand wrapped around the iron sand clone to contrict and implode. Causing iron sand to be disperesed around the area. "One down."* - Sat Sep 05 20:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) focused his attention to yet another iron clone, it was decided at the moment the two eyes met it was his next victim. "All right, you're next!" with that Tetsu gathered the iron sand utilized in the last technique plus the additional sand previous used in the last iron sand clone's existence. Once gathered, an amount about the desired size Tetsu's height branched off. The branched off amount raced forward at the second clone's body, on contact it began to wrap around its body like angry snakes until it encased its entire body. 

Yet again another pause before the finishing blow could've been used in a conjuction."Have..to try to piece these together faster. Zetsumo can easily pull it off with conjuctions and combos." the teen wasn't going to faulter in his training, if the villian could've obtained this fight, Tetsumi could accomplish this. With his palm idly open he'd close it shut tightning his grip, causing the sand to constrict and implode. Destroying the clone and sending another additional amount of the iron utilized in the technique across the dessert's sand, blackening it."Two down."* - Sat Sep 05 20:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) blackened particles of sand caught his eyes after each was dispersed along the sand in various locations plaguing the natural sand along the area. His eyes darted about until focusing on the last iron clone that remained, its faith was in Tetsumi's hands now. He'd take a deep breath and exhaled gathering the sand from the area including the destroyed clone. From all of these destructions so far, his supply of the sand increased. "Next." he focused on the idle clone, the lone ranger left from the trio. The sand was sent forward, the moment it smacked into the iron clone's being the sand began to wrap around the clone until it completely incased it in sand, restricting movement.

Another pause before the finishing combo for this type of technique. His palm remained open until he forcefully closed it crushing the clone trapped inside the coffin of death. Sand once more was blasted in different directions, all of the clones were now destroyed. "Finished."
* - Sat Sep 05 21:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) after his training, Tetsu felt quite impressed with himself. Maybe he'd even treat himself with a meal, even though the food of sunagakure sucked in comparison to the past. But for now, his training wasn't exactly over. He gathered all of the iron sand in the area above his head, once over his head he funneled every last grain of it into his gourd. A small amount of sand was left behind, forming an iron cork sealing off the top from potential spills. The teen motioned downward positioning himself on the soft but warm sand. On the ground he went into a meditative stance, brought his hands up to his mid-section of his body clasping his hands and closing his eyes.

Tetsumi felt at peace for a moment, but it was time to break the peace and continue his arguement with the beast inside."Yo, One'O!" basically refering him to the beast having one tail. It most likely wasn't his name, but he wanted to piss him off so the two could have a conversaion for a change. It was ironic for Tetsu, he felt like he was in Fuji's shoes how he tried every anything to make both of them jell together. * - Sat Sep 05 22:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) jumped a little hearing the ichibi's voice, such a disrespectful tone..But he wasn't going to cower, not one bit. The child went further into himself, he didn't see darkness anymore, everything came into view. Painting a vivid picture of the inner world inside of him. Right infront of him the beast dwelled, though it was currently in a prison of some kind, he'd take a step forward, gliding along the golden floor.

His head motioned upward attempting to focus on the beast, his eyes focusing on it attempting to make direct eye contact. Though their were still some doubt and fear in his heart remaining."Who're you really?" the teen questioned, he'd pause before even continuing in his speech unless interupted."And why do you rob me of my sleep!" he had to get it off of his chest, it'd been four years of lack of sleep, it drained the boy, now a teen. He had more to ask the beast, but that's what came to mind.* - Sat Sep 05 22:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sighed a little, the beast had a point...but he wasn't here to bitch over his dreaded past years being together with the beast. He'd laugh a little before replying, he found the raccon like beast a bit funny, yet threatning."No, i've called on you because I want to know you better. We're stuck together after all, right?" though judging from the beast's attitude he probably didn't care. Though Tetsumi wanted to better know him, and one day as he promised after losing Kronos in the war, somehow get a grip of this uncomprehendable power.* - Sat Sep 05 22:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) closed his eyes for a moment, letting it all soak in...But how could he possibly think straight, with a threat like that being given.. It sped up his heart race, but he wasn't going to be back down as yet."Mhmm.. I see. I won't let that happen, if that's the case. I've lost to much, I won't give in neither lose my will or way One'O." for a moment he continued looking on to the beast, invisioning his deceased friends. All of them gave him the will of not giving in, especially to the beast. "I'm Tetsumi Jiki!" the child roared back to the beast, he had an ego, so did the beast. Though that probably wouldn't get him anywhere. But atleast now, he knew he couldn't dive deeper into the darkness of his heart after each one dear to him passed.* - Sat Sep 05 22:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) held his heart for a moment after the one tailed beast delievered shots of that degree at him. Clutching his chest tighter he spoke up against the beast."Yes, i'm growing and i'll continue to do that. I won't lost my will nore my way, my friends despite being deceased are my strength. I've dove deeper into your power, everytime i've lost with out me knowing. But I won't any longer, one day i'll manage your power. For now, I have to keep you company and prevent you from breaking free." the child snickered at the end of it, he had faith in himself. He promised himself on his friend's graves.* - Sat Sep 05 22:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) digested the beast's words, its chuckling filled its prison..the teen's determined eyes continued to focus on him. At this time the golden floor beneath him vanished, from right under his feet..Nothing but darkness, an endless fall. He felt himself decending through the darkness, the beast's figure vanishing from his sight. "I'LL SHOW YOU! JUST WATCH!" at that time he felt a sensation sweeping over him, "Wha?.." the teen questioned before the link was destroyed, he'd open his eyes finding himself at his training grounds..Exactly where he was before diving deeper within himself."I'll prove you wrong." he knew just words wouldn't suffice, his actions for the future was going to contribute to this, he wasn't going to lose control and set something like him free.* - Sat Sep 05 23:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "The village, my power, my friends..." the beast's words hit home real hard, it was all true. "I'll manage all of those." he'd slowly rise from the floor, his gaze resting on the sand built buildings in his village before walking closer to civilization.* - Sat Sep 05 23:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: (This ngr) - Sun Sep 06 19:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "The hell is going?.." the teen questioned, it seemed to be some type of skirmish. He'd growl below his breath a bit fed up, both of his hands shot up to the mid-section of his body and began gathering chakra. His feet worked on its own as he dashed over to the scene, though it was obvious his feet couldn't go the distance either way his technique would come in handy. The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. At this time the iron cork from his gourd shot into the air as iron sand erupted from his gourd, the iron broke down into iron sand as well melding in with the rest. 

A hand gesture was made, manipulating the matterial to gather under his feet, becoming a lot denser than before. As the platform of iron was formed, it sweped the teen into the air towards the group to assist if he was needed. The beast's words echoing in his mind, he had to protect his village, maybe these actions would merit for something.* - Sun Sep 06 19:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) couldn't allow such an attack to land on Tethys, they could fight somewhere else..But not in sunagakure, plus their combined efforts were needed if we were to take out Zetsumo. The teen raced forward on the platform of iron through the sky above, at the time he all ready began gathering a large amount of iron sand he'd send this downward.

"Won't allow this...to continue!" went through Tetsumi's mind, at this time the iron sand on his command attempted to surround the kirigakure shinobi in a dome of sand hopefully protecting him?* - Sun Sep 06 19:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm.." seeing as the skirmish seemed to be over, he'd break down and remove the shield of iron that protected Tethys."*sigh* Conflict on top of conflict, at least fight after Zetsumo's dead." the teen mumbled from above, the iron sand utilized in the shield was recalled back to him, slowly funneling itself back into his gourd.* - Sun Sep 06 19:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm...lowered the platform of iron that he travaered through the sky on. He'd focus his attention on Dravae giving the state that Aiyana was in, "Yo, tend to her won't, Dravae!" he knew his medical boss would do it, unless he wanted to face Tetsu's wrath that is.* - Sun Sep 06 20:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "*sigh* Why're trying to be so nice, Tetsu?..She could die for all I care.." but the promise that he made to -him- had to be kept."You're going to be tended to, if you like it or not." with that, a swift motion of his hands were made, the metallic sand he manipulated raced forward attempting to wrap around Aiyana's body restricting further movement. Though the sand only wrapped around up to her neck, if allowed to."This isn't like me at all, Damn you One'O!"* - Sun Sep 06 20:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Pssst.. - Sun Sep 06 20:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: What are you guys...doing? - Sun Sep 06 20:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Somone's going to die? - Sun Sep 06 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: They're planning a attack..All out war.. - Sun Sep 06 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Isn't..killing...bad? - Sun Sep 06 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: It is...Very, but this man who they target..At one point wanted to kill your mother , he killed many.. - Sun Sep 06 20:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Mmm... - Sun Sep 06 20:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) before leaving with the group, he'd command the iron sand that restricted Aiyana's movement towards the hospital since Dravae didn't hear him well. Once their, he'd follow the nursing staff to the room she'd be held in, lowering the coffin of iron that restrained her he'd make her hands and legs visible for a moment so he could've strapped her down so the staff could work on her, it was for her own good.

"I'm sorry if this seemed out of the way, but..Ya'know can't afford you hurting yourself further, they'll take good care of you." with that he'd remove the sand, funnel it back into his gourd, place the iron cork and leave with the army.* - Sun Sep 06 20:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Tre sanders) whispers: Stay in the mansion or hidden tunnel witht the REAL me.. - Sun Sep 06 20:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to traverse through the ground below (about the same depth Fuji mentioned), Dravae was behind him since he was the medic and had another contributing aspect to ensure they aren't detected, his bugs. Since Yan's clone's weren't digging the hole anymore, Tetsu had to do the rest of the work. 
"We need to attack from another location, we can't attack head on." with that, the cork from his gourd undid itself as Iron sand spewed from his gourd manipulating the sand it'd form into a drill that kepted digging its way through beneatht the surface. He'd feel the heat from above, even the earth shook a little, but the attack didn't get the two."Make sure your bugs continue to mask us." he had to continue, spread out and find another route. Dravae as a medic had to survive, if he died...it was a result of war.* - Sun Sep 06 22:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued manipulating the drill of iron he formed, it continued to drill its way beneath the earthern surface of Konoha. Hopefully his chakra as well as Dravae's wasn't detected because of the depth that they traversed as well as the jamming bugs that didn't quite give away their exact location. His plan was to attack from behind or from another location while an all out battle was being fought at the surface with the four thousand dwindling troops above. To him, they were a distraction for his plan he had in mind.* - Sun Sep 06 23:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) hopefully by this time, Dravae and himself were out of range of the various attacks.. Hopefully, at this time he'd begin digging upward. If the math was right, they'd be a bit away from Zetsumo, a strategic place to strike from (about where the tree is hoping to dig a hole behind of the tree. Hopefully away from view). As the drill focused upward drilling the earth away, he'd remove a tag from his pouch. "Dravae, i'm going to dig a hole out of view. An open point where I can attack Zetsumo from..Hopefully.." he'd glare at the tag as earth was chipped away."Hopefully this'll do the trick and leave a room for the troops to be done with him. I just need you to keep those bugs up, so when I rise up, i'll be undetected by my chakra. Please, just keep this up a little longer."

(Hopefully in the next turn I finnally dig through the earth.)* - Mon Sep 07 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) finnally broke the surface, the moment he did a ray of sunshine shinned down on him as bugs on Dravae's command spread out across the area continuing its ability to probably keep their real location undetectable. It was time to act, as he crawled out of the hole he'd attempt to put his plans into action. Though on being graced with a visual look of the battle field, his heart dipped..Bodies, on top of bodies littered the battlefield.. A result of war, he didn't shed a tear he just felt himself becoming quite angry..The beast's words angering him further, One'O was probably right..He hadn't the strength to save his friends, but he was going to faulter in his belief, will, or morale or go back on his words that he felt were heard by it.

Iron sand was produced from his gourd, forming ten shuriken from the sand. All ten were sent in random locations near the battlefield, hopefully as well not giving out his location since he wasn't noticed as yet and since they were coming from different location.

While he formed a decent sized ball of iron sand, small enough to carry the tag he removed from before. Once done, it'd travel skyward attempting to catch Zetsumo off guard from a different route than the shurikens of iron.* - Mon Sep 07 00:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sighed as his shuriken of iron failed, which meant his sneak attack also resulted in failure. With the joint attacks an explosion was produced, his eyes scanned the battle field noticing the mask that had an affinity for lightning attempting to grab someone. "Is that?.." the teen wasn't sure, since he hadn't the chance to stop Zetsumo he'd attempt to destroy his pet. The scent of blood lingered in the air, bodies laid about everyone one of them dying with their dreams of seeing Zetsumo's death...Neither of them would take in oxygen again, his body shook in anger. 

A large amount of his sand was produced from his gourd, racing fourth to intercept the lightning masked beast. "I promised i'd protect them.." the teen said in a lowered shakey tone. If this didn't merit for anything or not on his part, he had to stop it. The sand shot out at various locations on the beast's body, attempting to bind its legs first, then its arms, and continue this if possible fully wrapping it up with his sand -if- possible.* - Mon Sep 07 02:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sat on the ground, feeling defeated. They won the war for now, but it didn't feel so for the teen. They lost so much and still couldn't kill Zetsumo. "DAMNIT!" his curse carried a ways as he punded his left hand on the ground. His promise didn't mean anything, he still lost more lifes. He'd look around, the female that Zetsumo's monster tried to steal was stopped in its tracks and destroyed. The teen still didn't shed a tear once, his eyes finnally met with the woman's features. It looked similar to Amu, maybe it was her? He hadn't seen her in..What?..Five years? "Amu?" the teen questioned, he too had changed, in height, body build, his voice became deeper than before, but he still was weak.

He'd raise a hand, recaling the grains of sand that remained across the battlefield. All of it funneled back into his gourd, he'd even retrieved his special tag that he hoped to take down Zetsumo with, his plan yet again ended in failure. Though some of his morale returned seeing as...if this feeling truely was Amu, he'd feel delighted. Maybe his way of wind wasn't cassed away as yet, he'd imagine recieving the fourtune cookie from Amu all those years ago..The words on it gave him hope, he hadn't changed, he still held a grip of his sanity.* - Mon Sep 07 03:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) focused on Nigen first, "H-He got away.." he felt a sensation building in his chest, it felt heavy..it was saddness that formed their. But his gaze shifted from Nigen as he stod from the ground below, he stod at 5'8 versus the 5'4 he stod at five years ago. He'd slowly walk towards Amu, tears formed in his eyes but not a single tear drop escaped his eye sockets as yet.."Its me..Tetsumi." he'd present to her the chilli powder bomb tag she created those years back. * - Mon Sep 07 03:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) Amu's scan indicated that it was really Tetsumi, though if she sensed his chakra levels  it'd have increased a great amount over the years."Its really me." the tears as that point broke way, the dam of emotions that he held inside couldn't be suppressed any longer. Though he'd take note of the woman's appearence, it looked as if she hadn't eaten in ages..Which also contributed to the inner guilt he felt that they couldn't save her after all of these years.* - Mon Sep 07 03:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) a smile shakingly stretched along his lips, he truely did miss the woman..Oh, so many things he wanted to tell her, like the things he endured, the state of the village, and sadder things like the people they've lost since she was kidnapped. 
Once in her embrace, his words were focused on Nigen for a moment."They're dead either way, thousands probably.." it left a bad taste in his mouth, then he'd focus on Amu."I missed you too..-I've endured and lost so much, but you're all right.." his rage subdued a little, his moral returned...their was one thing for him to do later, have a little chat once everything calmed down.* - Mon Sep 07 03:47:37 2015
