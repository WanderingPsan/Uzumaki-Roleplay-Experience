<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) had to clear his mind, "I'll continue my training, i'll be the best at this art." finding his usual spot he'd lean up against the large rock behind of him. He'd open his mouth slightly, his right hand motioned towards his mouth. Extending out his thumb he'd attempt to bite down on it, though in doing this caused iron sand to form over the area, protecting the teen from potential harm. He'd then add saliva into the mix, weakening the sand enough for him to place his tooth over his fleash and bite down drawing blood. With the blood drawn, he'd take out his thumb, the same time he did this he'd expell a mixture of salivia, sand, and blood from his mouth.

Formed the required handseals for the summoning technique, once executed he'd place his palm on the sand below. The moment his hand made contact with the sand summoning markings were visible around his palm. This was followed by a cloud of smoke, as the smoke vanished a raccoon emerged. It wasn't large, just a normal sized raccoon. 

Tetsumi piped up once the raccoon was visible to him, "We're going to continue where he left off. Please bear with me, I know the heat gets to you guys." he aplogized for the last time, he still felt bad about it.

//Raccoon on the other glared at the teen, though instead of going off on him. He'd make a gesture meaning, 'Don't sweat it.'. Once done, he'd dash up the teen's pant leg, up his shirt until he reached the teen's shoulder. Once on his shoulder, he'd wrap his tail around his neck for support and lean against his head a little.

//Tetsumi smiled, "Great! Let's get down to buisness."* - Tue Nov  3 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) a smile was visible on the teen's face, his smile parted as he opened his mouth once more. Inserting his thumb into his mouth he'd attempt to bite down again drawing blood, though as time after time his shield of sand protected the teen from harm. Iron sand appeared over the area where his teeth would've impaled his fleash, he'd add saliva into the mix weakning the sand to a degree. With said opening from his spit, he'd bite down drawing the needed blood to execute the technique. With his thumb extracted from his mouth, he'd expell a mixture of saliva, sand, and blood from within staining the sand below.

The teen formed the required seals for the summoning technique, executed he'd place his palm on the sand below. Summonigs marking appeared around his palm, followed by cloud of smoke. As the smoke dispursed five raccoons were summmoned forth from their homeworld. Each one exhaled an audible sigh since they knew training was coming.

//Tetsumi bowed a little while apologizing for the last time. "I'm.. really sorry. I'll make it easier this time. All right? Now. I want you six to servey the village, try to beat your last time... Andd....DISPERSE!" 

//Raccoon located on Jiki's shoulder leaped off, he'd land mixing in with the group of raccoon. All six raccoon swiftly moved into groups of three each. Each group of three split into their respective groups and serveyed their respective areas. * - Tue Nov  3 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) went over the seals for the summoning technique, the process everything minus actually bitting down. He'd have done this while the raccoons serveyed the village. In doing these drills, he'd get a better feal for the technique.

//Raccoon group one serveyed the western section of the village, while Raccoon group two serveyed the eastern section of the village. Sweat mixed in with their fut as they did their job. High and low the raccoons serveyed the village.* - Tue Nov  3 08:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) went over the same old drill as before, he'd start off with placing his thumb in his mouth but he didn't bite down. After this he'd go through the handseals for the summoning technique, once executed he'd place his palm on the sand. "I'm getting the hang of this." he noticed his progress so far, even if it wasn't much it still  progress. 

//Raccons were finished with their specific serveys of their areas, weither it was the western or eastern portion of the village. The two groups of raccoons met back up, merging into one whole group. This combined group of six dashed towards Tetsumi's last known position. In the distance they'd noticed Tetsumi training as well., which shocked them since they expected him to be either relaxing or sleeping. 

The group of raccoons arrived infront of Jiki, their fur coated in sweat. Each one of them laid out on the sand tired, they didn't even care about how hot the sand was, that's how burnt the raccoons were.

Tetsumi noticed the Raccoons arrival, he'd put his drill on hold while brimming at them."You all were slower this time.. Ahaha, Joking. You six did great, give me a fist bump. Then you six could rest up for the day." saying this he'd extend his fist outward infront of the summoned animals, a last act before they returned to their respective world.

All six of the raccons placed their paws against Jiki's fist, overlapping it to an extent. Each one shook their head in unison as all six erupted into smoke, the smoke joined into one as all of the summoning animals departed.

The teen smiled, "I'll see you all till next time." his training had come to a close for now in that aspect. He'd head towards the village square.* - Tue Nov  3 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked from left to right while walking walking towards the square. So far it seemed as if the streets of sunagakure were inactive, dead even. It wasn't something new to teen, he did roam the village at odd hours of the night since he didn't sleep. "Another night."  while he walked he'd place his thumb into his mouth, though he didn't bite down to draw blood. Aftet this he'd brought both of his hands towards the mid-section of his body as he formed the required seals for the summoning technique. Executed he'd place stop his movement, bend over and place his hand on the sand below.

Once done he'd continue his nightly stroll towards the square of the village.* - Tue Nov  3 08:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: She needs to tag out, that hit did quite a number on her. She'll get herself killed like this. - Tue Nov  3 08:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked around the village's square but hadn't found no a sign of life in the area. "I guess its later than I expected?.." since he hadn't found anyone at all, maybe people were at the arena? While he walked over towards the arena, he'd place his thumb into his mouth though he didn't bite down. After this process he'd remove his thumb from his mouth, both of his hands motioned towards the mid-section of his body. At this point in his body he'd form the required seals for the summoning technique, once executed he'd stop movinng and place his hand on the sand below.

"Mhmm?" looking up he'd notice Sanoke at the arena's entrance."I knew somethin' was up." he'd continue down the path to the arena to see exactly what may have been going on.* - Tue Nov  3 08:52:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked up at the sky, it was dark and cloudy. For a change in the sandy dessert of sunagakure it was raining for some odd reason."Why is it raining? And like this.." the rain danced on his skin, a cold yet warm sensation washed over the teen. It was an odd feeling, "Mhmm.. Still. I have to train." he'd thought while at the training area in where he trained. He'd brought his thumb up to his mouth, placing it in his mouth. Bitting down on his thumb, iron sand materialized over the area where the injury would've been. Reacting to this obstacle he'd add salivia into the mix weakning the sand a little, just enough for his teeth to pierce through the sand. As it did, he'd bite down drawing blood. 

With the blood drawn, his thumb was removed and he'd expell a mixture of iron sand, saliva, and blood from his mouth, staining the sand. Both of his hands motioned towards the mid-section of his body, at this point in his body he'd formed the required seals for the summoning technique. Once executed, he'd place his palm on the sand below. In doing so, summong markings appeared around his palm followed by a plume of smoke. With the smoke present the teen spoke from the jump."All right! It may be raining today but w-" 

The smoke blew over revealing the same raccoon Kilm summoned, something Tetsumi noticed which is why he hadn't finished his sentence. He'd appear tea cup in hand, "I have news Tetsumi... I don't know how to say this but. Kilm has passed." as he said this, it was visibly stressful for him as well. The scent from the tea was stronger than usual, he'd take another swig of it.

Tetsumi eyes widened, his voice quivered a little, "W-What?...How?.." he tried to keep his emotions in check, his right hand clenched.

//Chopper sighed, "A woman and a man killed him." as he said this, he'd describe the two from the intel gathered. "Keep your head up young one, he'll be missed." Chopper's own british acent was breaking, a tear flowed from his right eye as he spoke. He'd wipe his tear away before vanishing in a plume of smoke, "I'll see you until then Jiki." his figure, his chakra, every trace of him vanished except the strong scent of his tea that lingered in the air for a moment before dissipating as well.

"...Katsune... And him?...." the things that flowed through out his mind, it wasn't teraputic in the slightest nature. From his training area, he'd begin to storm the village, in search of those two. They couldn't live, he didn't even care if he was lacked of for murdering two individuals that probably didn't have physical evidence of slaying Kilm.* - Tue Nov  3 20:18:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) seemed to be a little hardened than usual around Kana, aparently even unfazed by her presence it was obvious he was upset. Kana would find that Tetsumi wasn't injured on the serface, just lacking his usual oversized gourd. He didn't pull away or resist Kana's touch, she'd manage to get a hold of his hand.

"......They killed him....." he didn't understand, why would fellow shinobi kill each other. The again, he didn't understand why in the first place he even for the slightest trusted someone that once worked for Zetsumo the war lord. Mentally, he had decided he'd kill her and her aparent help in his murder. Then again, he wasn't sure if the raccoons were one hundred percent correct.* - Tue Nov  3 20:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Well..." as he said this, he'd advance towards the middle chair in the office. He'd remove a scroll from one of his pouches, unraveling the scroll he'd place it infront of Hassan. It was a write up, or summary of the armor he'd hope could be forged. It listed the abilities of the armor, 'The armor I have in mind, it will cover the entire body, light weight, with the ability to absorb chakra based attacks used against it.'* - Wed Nov  4 17:34:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was already on it when Yan spoke, though instead of taking towards the skies himself he'd scout the village with the usage of his third eye technique. He'd brought two fingers up to his left eye, closing said eye he'd press his fingers against it while channeling chakra. Blackened sand sprang to life out of what seemed to be thin air, more sand gathered forming into an eye that gained color to match Tetsumi's own eye. This eye was sent into the air to search at an aerial perspective.* - Wed Nov  4 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Kuro? - Wed Nov  4 19:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Uh huh." folded his arms across his chest as Ketsuki went through her drills to wake herself up."I guess i'll go find somethin' to do, its rather borin' ya'know." he'd say this while walking away.* - Wed Nov  4 20:23:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) slowly walked out of the kazekage's office, he'd shut the door behind of him. The moment his eyes left the knob of the door he'd notice Ume peering over him."Hello." he'd attempt to greet the purple haired female.* - Wed Nov  4 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shook his head to Ume's question, "Yes it is. What's your reason for seeing him?" she'd ask, it was a safeguard in place for potential assasinations on the geezer. Then again, the man was scary as is. But with the village on high alert and with the fires of later, Tetsumi honestly didn't trust others he hadn't known as much.* - Wed Nov  4 20:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I doubt he doesn't like you. It takes a lot for the geezer to dislike you. Mhmm. - Wed Nov  4 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He only is letting me stay two days.... I have to leave soon. - Wed Nov  4 20:44:09 2015
