<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) body trembled for a moment, from just hearing Fuji's name it rilled him up. Everywhere the teen went everyone asked for the man, they wanted to learn from him. It began to get rather annoying to the teen, though he knew none of them meant anything by it just by asking the teen where his step father might've been."I..have no idea where..that man may be nore do I know where Marrisa is, i'm sorry Nina." though he could see the desperation in here eyes, he actually felt bad and wished he could've actually helped but he was the last of his kind in a sense.

At this Bryson arrived with a message for the teen, "Mhmm? What is it?" the medical shinobi leaned in close whisper details of the matter to him."I see..I understand." from there his voice lowered until his own words weren't heard from by even Nina."I'm paying attention to Fuji and his underlings, I just..Maybe i'm crazy but I've been getting this bad vibe lately." after whispering these words, he'd refocus on Nina.* - Sat Oct 24 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) moved to the side as Nina walked right past him towards the square's direction, "Guess i'm not needed.." the teen thought, he'd walk over towards the wall. Leaning on the wall of the training grounds his back slid down against it until he was seated. Maybe he'd just have a chat with shukaku instead, he pondered this for a moment whither he should or he shouldn't.* - Sat Oct 24 06:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm..To much people..Can't concentrate." the teen thought before motioning towards towards his feet, once on his feet he'd attempt to walk away. Maybe he could find another quiet yet peaceful area, maybe his home? That was a prime canditate but Madelyn had a tendency of snoring loud, he wouldn't be able to concentrate."Tch.. Maybe another place." the teen mumbled while leaving.* - Sat Oct 24 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) would be seen at the foot of their bed, his feet were crossed, his hands were clasped at the mid-section of his body. He was meditating, not a sound escaped from the teen's figure. Inside of his mind he he'd this same position, though the only differance was that his eyes remained open while focusing on the beast beyond its prison.

//Tetsumi "How are you today, Shukaku?" the teen asked his voice kind, his eyes focused on the beast showing him respect. It had been a while since he'd visited the beast back this place, the place that held him captive."

//Shukaku's voice boomed as he spoke, me he have meant this or not it was a mystery to the human."Nothing, it gets a bit dull. Plus there isn't anythin' intresting going on in your life, you're boring now. Let's make it a bit fun! You give me control an'"

//Tetsumi rudely cut off the beast from finishing his words, "No No.. I can't do that..I'm in the village, plus who says you won't kill everyone. It'll be bad karma for me, fun for you but bad karma for me." the kept eye contact with the beast, his face seemed calm.

//Shukaku "You'd even protect them? You're a weird one. Complete...IDIOT! Tch, I could never understand you. I know other humans would grasp at my power to obtain revenge, why don't you?" the beast questioned, his eyes piercing deep into the child's being as if trying to intemediate him."

//Tetsumi "Because, I have to protect this village. I can't have you killing everyone because you're bored. Hehe."

//Shukaku "Its that girl isn't it? Has she changed you? At one point, you were going to use my power to obtain your revenge. Why has that changed?...HAS SHE CHANGED YOU?!" The tanuki obviously was upset, though it was normal for the two to argue on occastions.

//Tetsumi blushed a little."Maybe." //Shukaku sighed "Soon enough you'll be on the same path as before, your luck isn't the best. She'll die just like Amu. Then you'll be here, at my cage once more demanding power for revenge." the tanuki laughed, he knew Tetsumi too well."

In the outside world, in the world of reality where his physical self remained he'd began shaking a bit for some odd reason.* - Sat Oct 24 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //Shukaku looked elsewhere for a moment as if seeing something beyond this realm that Tetsumi hadn't noticed as yet."You'd better attend to that." with that his vision of the world deconstructed, vanished before the child's eyes.

//Tetsumi jumped to life, his eyes opened noticing Madelyn, his mind took into account the feeling he'd felt around his next. His eyes adjusted noticing it was Madelyn's arms around his neck, she was positioned behind of him."Mhmm..Yes..I can't go to sleep." he'd paused before answering a smile formed on his lips, "Its..out of f-actually..Its no longer out of fear, its out of love why I haven't fallen asleep. I don't fear him any longer, though I fear he destroys this village. I can't have him killing what I care about." as he said this he'd plant a kiss on Madelyn's cheek.* - Sat Oct 24 18:51:05 2015

Easing himself off of the bed a low screech was heard from the bed the moment his body shifted. He'd held his breath expecting Madelyn to get up, but she was sound asleep. "That..was close." he'd  mumbed while trying to creep towards the door, though the moment he'd taken three complete steps or advances forward Madelyn voice was heard."I'll..kill..you..ahaha..." this sent shivers down his spine, he'd turn around rather alarmed but it turned out that the female was sleep talking. "You..crazy woman..." the teen commented while heading towards the door.

Opening the door, he'd question "What is it?" the individual at the door wore a chuunin vest.//Sunagakure Chuunin"Sorry to bother you but..We have a mission for you sir..." he'd hand the Jounin the scroll containing vital infromation of his mission and who'd occupany him in completing his assignment.

//Tetsumi sighed, "I..I see. Thank you." Inside he wanted to curse at the messenger weren't there other Jounin that they could bother. Either way he couldn't fuss nore whine, there was an assigment to be handled. He'd gotten ready, dressed for duty his gourd worn on his back."I'll be back safe Madelyn." the teen blew his girlfriend an air kiss before leaving. He was headed towards the gate, while walking towards his destination he'd unroll the scroll reading from it."Tch..Why am I always stuck with the icky jobs?" the jounin questioned, at this time he arrived at the gate. His head picked up noticing Yan's figure at the gate, "Ahhh...you're back from vacation?" the teen questioned while advancing over to the blonde's position a smile brandished on his face.* - Sat Oct 24 23:44:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shook his head, he fastened the strap of his gourd, his headband dangled from his neck freely. "Yeah, I have things I need to do back at the village. Still haven't finished some of my paper work." it was a bit depressing remembering this, which would mean after this mission he'd have yet another mission report on his hands. Then he'd be in some more trouble if he didn't return in time, else he'd have to face Madelyn's wrath. Either way he was royally fucked. 

A smile formed on the teen's lips, he'd already accepted defeat. There wasn't much for the teen to do at this point, for he'd put Madelyn, and his paper work a like at the back of his mind. Both would hinder him mentally during his mission, couldn't allow this a failed mission meant he was a failure and that's something he wasn't.

"Yeah, let's go. From the mission report, he killed his brother. I don't hold any remorse for his type." with that the two shinobi ventured through the dessert to their destination where the criminal was said to be seen last.* - Sun Oct 25 00:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stop up from the bench where he and Madelyn sat, he'd yawn a little."I guess we'll see you guys later." with that he'd leave the area side to side with Madelyn. Though the yawning was only a hoax from the teen.* - Sun Oct 25 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) whispers: [ grab me - Sun Oct 25 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) headed towards their home, he'd look around his eyes scanning the are around him. His voice lowered down into a whisper, "We'll go look for her now." he hoped they found Mirai before Hassan found or or she was hurt in the wild. He for one knew her dangerous the wild were, there were bandits, crazed animals, you were more vernarable to the elements. "We'll find her." he tried to assure his girlfriend. 

The iron cork from his gourd slackened before it was removed from the gourd, as it was removed Iron sand seeped out of his gourd. The blackened sand flowed out of the gourd and towards their feet. A single platform that supported both of them and their weight formed. The platform slowly levitated from the ground, as it rose he'd head west he'd start from the west to the east in his search."I'll need your eyes now Madelyn." was heard from the teen, the platform cruised through the sky.* - Sun Oct 25 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) searched from above, he heard Madelyn's voice and complied with her orders."G'otcha." he'd slow down the platform of iron's speed by a lot. Hopefully it'd be easier for Madelyn to pin point Mirai's chakra signature since the speed they traversed the skies were decreased. "Mhmm...Anything yet?" the teen questioned while looking about himself.* - Sun Oct 25 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: Wait, maybe if I send her a bird message? - Sun Oct 25 02:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Maybe i'll be able to track the bird down. - Sun Oct 25 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was prepared to chase after the bird while Madelyn prepared the messenger bird. Maybe this'd help in locating Mirai a bit quicker. Time was something that the two didn't have, especially when tracking someone. Each second that ticked down, the trail and hopes of tracking that said person grew colder.* - Sun Oct 25 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) lost track of the messenger bird, "Damnit.." the teen cursed, his eyes couldn't track the bird, maybe Madelyn were able to track the bird despite the distance that his own eyes couldn't track. "Anything yet?" he probably annoyed his girlfriend with his repeated 'Anything yet?' but he was concerned, though not probably as concerned as Madelyn, she was her twin sister after all.* - Sun Oct 25 02:51:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shrugged his shoulders and turned around the platform of iron sand, both of the lovers soared through the skies traveling back to their village. Event hough it was Madelyn's call he couldn't help but feel uneasy.* - Sun Oct 25 02:54:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "You..what?.." the teen's voice was breaking, he couldn't believe the words that came out of Madelyn's mouth. Tears formed in the teen's eyes, it distorted his vision made it fuzzy even. She'd began slurring out different type of curses at the child, she'd lost her mind. It was obvious but to Tetsu he'd taken it harsh. Even thing they built, all of it, every building block..It all came crashing down before his eyes. "N-No..You can't leave me.." his voice cracked, she'd be carried away by medical shinobi to be transported back to the mental hospital of her youth.

He'd fallen to very sands below his feet. How could he live any longer? It made the beast's very words true. In his mind the tanuki's voice boomed."I told you, though I may have been wrong in the manor that she left you..BUT You're all alone again, sad. Don't you feel a sense of regret? Rage? Yes, I feel it growing in your chest. Just allow me to wipe everyone out, it'll compensate for your rage."

//Tetsumi snapped back, no he didn't speak in his mind like he'd usually do to converse with the beast. Instead he yelled back, villagers around him staring at him as if he were crazy."SHUT UP! I AIN'T NO ONES PUPPET!" he'd repeatedly punch the ground, but the moment he increased in the lethality of said punches iron sand materalized preventing the teen from hurting himself.
There was nothing left but hate in Tetsumi's being now, he didn't care any longer. He'd held out his hand focusing, channeling chakra to his palm. Reacting to this iron sand was crafted from his very own chakra, it shaped into a kunai. This iron kunai was held tight in Tetsumi's grasp. He'd attempt to plundge this kunai into his chest potentially ending his life. Though it didn't go as planned. This time iron sand from his gourd burst forward shielding himself from killing himself.

Tears flowed from the teen's eyes, "FUCK IT!!!!" he looked up at the heavens as he cursed. "WHY MUST I SUFFER?!" he continously punched the sand, each time iron sand blocked his punches. He'd risen his arms, infront of his eyes they shook. He didn't understand, yet a part of his mind finally snapped. A smile formed on the teen's lips, it wasn't his regular nore cocky grin. It was a phychotic look, the same old cheerful Tetsumi he tried to revenge..All of it..It was gone, hidden beneath his rage. Would it resurface? That was the mystery, maybe he just needed time, such as most heart breaks were.* - Sun Oct 25 04:52:41 2015
