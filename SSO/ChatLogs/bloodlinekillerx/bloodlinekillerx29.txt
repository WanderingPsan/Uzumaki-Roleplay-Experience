<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) honestly, he would've stopped it before but wanted to see how far the two would go. With Yan interfering, it made the situation worse since Mitsunara out of fear, reaction, what ever reason continued with her general attack."Shit!" his mind worked overtime, he only had to do one thing anyway. Since the threat was bound, he just needed to stop Mitsunara's attak.

His eyes opened wildly, the iron cork from his gourd was forced from the gourd, shot into the air. Followed by this, he'd a large amount of sand was released from his gourd, manipulated forward towards the two, attempting to stop Mitsunara's attack.. Though he may have failed, with the sand rushing forward it'd form into a dense durable shield of iron sand, simply attempting to make a wall infront of the monster.

With the wall erected, he'd change the shape of the shield. Causing the sand to push the two backwards, away from each other."I didn't expect.. this to get out of hand."* - Tue Nov 10 06:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Just take it easy... You're hurt, right?" while saying this, he'd step forward. The moment he stepped forward he gathred chakra. The gathered chakra converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. The iron cork from the teen's gourd slackened, a low 'Poping' sound was heard as the cork was removed. It fell towards the sand below, with it released blackened sand, iron sand seeped out. 

The flow of iron sand was constrolled, he'd manipulate the flow of sand forward over towards the workers. Shaping the iron sand into a large arm he'd assist by helping lifting heavy things they needed or needed to move that were too heavy. "First.. I'm sorry about yesterday." honestly, he didn't see it as his fault, but she'd gotten hurt. Secondly, you wanted to speak with me..

Somethin' about drinks or somethin' like that.. I forgot as well.. I have a lot of things going on in my mind." * - Tue Nov 10 21:10:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Great! Ahaha."  but his enjoyment came to a close, a loud scream was heard from the eastern homing complex. He was right there, helping out the contractors. He'd make a handgesture, the sand flowing back into his gourd. "What the?.." was heard from the teen, his head going from the left to right, trying to pin point the source of the scream. Was it in a house?* - Tue Nov 10 21:29:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) saw Kiyoko's body thrown out of the house like a rag doll from the distance, Mitsunara and himself approached after hearing the scream, they were near by after all. Though Marrisa entered the house first, from his point of view he wasn't sure what Marrisa was about to face. What could've possibly, done that to Kiyoko? Such strength.. 

If he'd been able to enter the house, he'd attempt to follow behind of Marrisa, for simple back up in restraining Aza.* - Tue Nov 10 22:02:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) watched as Mizora ran in, he was already running in as well in help of restraining the monsterous Aza. "He's transformed again?" the teen thought in his mind, Mizora on the other hand utilzing the oppourtunity to strike while the beast was bound already by Marrisa. "I won't allow her to attack him now, its already over." honestly, he felt like it was his duty since he understod how having no control of his own actions, as well as having that monstrous side of oneself.. He and Tetsumi were a like.

A large portion of Iron sand erupted out of the teen's gourd, it sped forward splitting into two sections, one section forming a durable wall infront of Aza from potential harm. While the other portion of sand wrapped around his body, consuming his monstrous figure until he was binded up to his neck. 

"Mizora.. Calm down.." maybe people would find him bias? Honestly he didn't care in the slightest.* - Tue Nov 10 22:30:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) had enough at this point, shinobi didn't listen for anything. His mind worked over time, in his mind everything slowed down. But in reality everything was moving at its normal pace probably even faster than his own pace. Hif first priority was in keeping the transformed Aza safe and alive. Things became difficult, as Marrisa approached he already had half a mind to stop her but she attempted to knock Aza out. In this moment Mizora would've tried to stop her, as well as attempting to strike Aza...

Anger welled up inside of the teen, "...YOU FUCKIN'!..." as his voice intensified, his sand reacted, aimed manipulate the iron sand in the room to forcefullly form into an arm, this large arm would both push Marrisa and Mizora backwards. Attempting to stop both attacks and advances to hurt Aza.

As the sand pushed the two backwards, he'd make another hand gesture, prompting the sand to restrain the two shinobi. Yes this time, if allowed thier entire body, from the buttom of their feet to the crown of their heads. Both threats would be dealt with.

//(Stratagem Perk) his mind was planning every action out, now he'd tend to Aza. His extended hand, his sand a massive amount, grain on grain pushed his hand backwards. Attempting to reel it back in to his side, as he did this it'd clumb back together, being covered with iron sand. Hell the sand would continue to travel up his body, from where it haulted at his neck to cover his entire being. With the sand coffin, two holes were visible for each of them, holes made for them to breath through their nostrils.

More sand raced forward, forming a dome of iron sand around the Aza. Why? Incase any of those two, meaning Marrisa, or Mizora broke free or escaped his sand's clutches and proceeded to attack.* - Tue Nov 10 23:12:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) made a hand gesture, the coffin of iron sand that binded both Mizora and Marrisa levitated out of Aza and Nari's house. The house most likely looked like a mess, sand scattered about, filling a large portion of their home. With Marrisa's and Mizora's coffin removed from the home, he'd made another hand gesture prompting the minature dome of iron sand around a restricted Aza to crumble away. Aza to, who was trapped in his sand as well leviatetd above ground.

Tetsumi slowly walked out of the home, his face seemed blank the moment he stepped out noticing the group of people gathred. Did.. Did they hear him? Aza's coffin of iron sand followed behind of him. He wouldn't say anything, he found this situation awakward.* - Tue Nov 10 23:47:37 2015

Though the sand around Aza remained intact. 

Another hand gesture prompted every grain of sand, except the sand that restricted Aza to flow back into his gourd, storing it away for later use. As he walked away with out another word, Aza's sand coffin followed behind of him as the teen attempted to leave the area.* - Tue Nov 10 23:55:18 2015
