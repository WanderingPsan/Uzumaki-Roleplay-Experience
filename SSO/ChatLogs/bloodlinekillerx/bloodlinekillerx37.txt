<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) yawned a bit, "Well~ its becoming late, I'm going to patrol the village once more. Then I'm going to bed... SEE YA~!" the armored individual's stepped backwards, attempting to leave. His eyes trained on Osuda's body, incase he tried anything. The armored guy seemed shaken up, as if afraid of confrontation, just from judging from his tone.* - Thu Dec 10 06:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored individual laughed before leaving, "An armored hero does his best work from the shadows!!!!" his voice was energetic, child like, but a bit deepened from the mouth piece that was connected to the helmet."I'll see you!" 

On stepping outside, the door closed behind of him while he waved. A concealed grin beneath his helmet. As the door shut, it was time for his escape. He'd brought his hands up to his mid-section, once there he'd form the required seals for one of his techniques. On execution of the technique, chakra was funneled into the earth below. The earth softened up, transforming into fine sand as the armored guy sank into the ground below, attempting to flee the scene in secret! "ESCAPE NO JUTSU!!!!" he'd thought as he made his escape.* - Thu Dec 10 06:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) brought both of his hands over his mouth piece, the part of his helmet that projected and distorted his voice."U-Umm.. Hokage ma'am..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) forced himself to stand up on the fence, this task alone seemed to be a lot on the armored individual, the armor weighed down his body. The moment he stod on the fence, his figure erupted in a plume of smoke, only to reappear at Rias's side. His left hand around her neck, holding on her for support, draw backs of the shunshin technique! "Y-You don't have to be so... hard on them.. Ughh..." his head was spinning, his head spun as well, in a minture circle until his world came back in to focus, a smile worn beneath his helmet.* - Fri Dec 11 00:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) "Hmm... Wonder if there is somethin' for me to do..." he'd look up at the sky for a brief moment before refocusing on the people within the area. Without another word, his body vanished, being erased by nothing but white smoke. * - Fri Dec 11 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Fri Dec 11 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Now what do you plan on doing? - Fri Dec 11 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) came to a hault, his feet skidding across the floor. He'd tilt a bit to the right, his right hand extended outward reaching out to the fence for support. His head spun a little. It probably was the cost of not paying much attention to the shunshin techique in his previous years.. Not that he tried to perfect the technique, he felt the faint dizzy spells now and again from usage of the technique.  

His vision cleared up, his sights set on the sky above. "Guess it won't hurt to try and get something to eat.." With this in mind, chakra flowed through his entire body, mainly his feet. Dashing forward, he'd left a plume of smoke in his wake. In his high speed movements, he'd finally come across the ramen shop."Maybe... I'd prefer fish but.. Its best I don't leave the village for hunting at this time.." once more, the armored guy stumbled over, this time leaning against the ramen shop's entrance for support. It seemed he'd have to stop here for food either way, even if it wasn't his plan at first.

As his head stopped spinning, he'd stumble back inside. On entering he'd notice two people, the girl Akechi from before, and the timid kid, Kai. He'd release a low sigh, this meant he'd have to play the fool once more while others were around.

* - Fri Dec 11 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Oh.. d-didn't expect people to be here... Garsh... - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: ..... - Fri Dec 11 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: He's crying again?... - Fri Dec 11 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) pushed away the curtails on entering the ramen shop, as he entered he'd notice Kai crying once again.. Behind of his helmet, his left eye twitched a little. Was that all that he did? But he couldn't complain nore get on his back, he wasn't any better in his youth.

His head turned towards Akeechi, noticing she tried to calm the boy down. Now, he was up to bat, it was his time to try and make Kai laugh, smile, or make him scared or mentally scarred.. "HELLLLOOOOO~!" his voice sounded chipper, something that Akechi nd Kai had seen of this persona.* - Fri Dec 11 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) blinked twice behind of his helmet the moment Kai slammed his hand against the table, in the outside the armored guy looked afraid even shivered a little. On the inside, he wasn't scared in the slightest. His eyes followed Kai, as the child attempted to leave, he wasn't having that. Moving in tandum with the child's movements, he'd stand in his way, his hands extended outward blocking his path.

In his same child like voice, playful even but a bit deepened thanks to the mouth piece of the helmet."You don't have to leave, if I did something to offend you... I'm sorry, I'm trying hard to make friends...Very.. Very... Very hard."  he'd keep his eyes trained on him, incase he was potentially attacked. His movements seemed to have been a bit sluggish, but still fast enough.* - Fri Dec 11 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Yare Yare daze.. - Fri Dec 11 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) hadn't moved not even an inch, though he shivered a bit on the outside seemingly afraid of Kai and his tone of voice. Though on the inside, his voice, how he stared at him.. It hit a nerve, something from the past, a past life that  he abandoned. If he hadn't known any better, or wasn't as nice.. He'd probably stangle the boy.

"I'm not moving, nore am I leaving!!!~ We're going to settle this as a village and family. Set down, talk it out." still, he wasn't moving.* - Fri Dec 11 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) didn't move not an inch, his eyes followed Kai's movements. His eyes widened the moment Kai's leg reached outward, it was aimed towards his left knee. Though because of the armor, and how tough his body naturally was, it probably wouldn't cause his knee to buckle. At this time, another assault was being launched, though at this close range he couldn't do much. As Kai's hand almost connected with his helmet, sand blackened sand materialized, just a little to defend against the punch. The sand after defending the armored guy, fell to the ground.

He'd release a sigh, still the armored guy stayed in his path, unmoving. He didn't want to hurt Kai at all. Just talk, nothing more nothing less.* - Fri Dec 11 03:40:35 2015

Executed, he'd transform into an ordinary civilian that walked past.

"SHOW TIME!!!!!" erupted through out his mind, the armored guy or now ordinary civilian!!! Was ready to snoop! And keep tabs on the Hokage, that was his job after all.* - Fri Dec 11 23:00:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) looked off into the distance, his feet swung back and forth while watching from a top of the Hokage's building. Time flew by so fast, he couldn't even believe how much time passed in what seemed like just a short time. His hair was growing out longer, he'd gained a foot or two, he even got his armor adjusted in height, which cost quite some money to do. "I can't allow myself to become lax, there is always someone that can beat me."

Within his mind, a voice boomed into existance teasing the teen."Everyone always could've beaten you, you're an sorry excuse for a human." the teen smiled behind of his helmet. He wouldn't take Shukaku's words to heart, the beast just went on and on most of the time. Though, he'd taken the tanuki's words as motivation to improve himself further.

With the beast's words in mind, he'd vanished from a top of the roof in a plume of smoke. Shortly after utilizing the body flicker technique to arrive where he wanted to be, it was a desserted area outside of the village. Not a single sul in sight, perfect for training. He'd removed the mouth piece of the helmet, allowing a freash source of air to filter through his lungs, and the cool breeze to kiss his fleash. It sure was a nice feeling, with the metal piece discarded his hands flowed to the mid-section of his body. He'd clasped his hands, channeling chakra through out his body, compressed wind was produced into a powerful gale that rushed through the area. He'd then throw four shurikens forward, each one enhanced with wind natured chakra from the wind, boosting his speed forward.

Followed by this, he'd formed another set of handseals. There was a dealy, he tried to keep up though, trying to keep as less delays and combinations as possible. He'd inhaled air, the air was shaped into bullets of wind within him. His lips parted, blowing outward he'd released a total of four bullets into the fray of wind natured attacks. This was simply for him to practice chaining techniques together.* - Sat Dec 12 01:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) watched as the wind died down, while it did he'd bent over slightly, hunched over a little his hands placed on the floor. He'd concentrated, chakra flowing through out his hands and feet. The chakra was converted into iron sand, his own chakra created the blackened sand. Though, it wasn't that much of the material since it took him time to creature the material out of his own chakra, as well as preparing a greater technique.

More chakra flowed through out the area, reacting to the mass of chakra sent through out the area, more iron sand was created, littering the green field of life around him. The sand whiped around, surging around the teen, touching him at some points, as if excited to see him again. The armored teen sent more chakra through out the area, eventually as more time passed he'd created enough iron sand for the plan in mind. 

His hands rose up, commanding every grain of iron sand in the area. It looked as if he was conducting music, such grace behind each hand gesture made. The sand pilled up, creating waves of sand, each positioning itself properly. The massive wave of iron sand eventually after molding and preperation, was formed into a Tsunami of death. Thrusting his both hands forward, the massive wave washed through the area that was filled of life or what was once filled of life. The sand flowed through the area, knocking over trees easily, burrying animals, whatever was the armored guy line of sight.  At least he practiced this technique, away from the village...

Following this, his hands motioned to the mid-section of his body forming a set of seals. On execution of these seals, he'd inhaled air filling his lungs until it was at the brink, until he couldn't take in any more air. His stomach grew a little, wind natured chakra mixed in. His lips parted slightly before blowing outward releasing a sudden gust of wind. The wind washed through the area, knocking down more trees the sand hadn't reached as yet. 

A slight smile was visible on the armored individual's lips, he'd formed another hand gesture. A total of ten shuriken were formed from the massive gathering of iron sand in the area, mainly from the tsunami. On its formation, he'd extend all ten fingers forward, propelling the shurikens forward into the wind, each of the ten shurikenwere enhanced with wind natured chakra. Its sharpness, ability to wound, and its speed in advancing forward to its target, which wasn't decided. Instead he'd leave each iron sand shuriken ride the wind, off into the distance to where ever they were destined to hit.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Civilian watched as the two went off somewhere else, he'd released a low sigh. He really disliked this job, plus he wasn't a fan of constantly chasing after the hokage trying to keep tabs on the woman. Instead of continuing to pursue the two on foot, he'd hold out his hand.  Closing his left eye he'd channeled chakra to the eye, iron sand materilized out of thin air. Just enough sand for what he had in mind, plus it would fit in with the area. 

The sand fomed into an ordinary bird, one that looked like any bird around Konoha. With that, the bird took flight. From a tree it'd watch the two, sadly he coudn't hear the conversation but it was meant to mainly monitor the woman. Sometimes villagers had crazy ideas, he had to protect the woman.* - Sat Dec 12 02:16:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored Individual allowing the air to continue to kiss the cheeks of his flesh would pair together another set of seals. In the time allowed the being would think of a combo and utilize it instantly at the moment his seal is completed! Cheeks now pressing against the force of the breeze due to the pressure bottling up within his mouth. Hed wait for the max build up and release a fury of wind bullets, and as luck would have it a large swarm of locust would be migrating toward him. These creatures would be in the MILLIONS! So, once the Agents attack is released it would impact the swarm of locust head on, but this would only be the start of his dual casting combo! 

As the Armored individual quickly pulls out finely crafted kunais from his back-pouch. He would chunk theM toward the swarm, and increase the rate of their speed by linking together hand seals causing the kunais to increase in speed. And the backside of the previous Air bullets to increase as well! (Giving the succession of this technique it should be noted that some of the kunais would imbed themselves within the air bullets. Causing damage simultaneously to the approaching swarm! He was doing the most as he hoped to perfect his dual casting abilities. 

Though these attacks were fluent and powerful in nature this wasnt a normal swarm of locust, nor were their numbers slim! As to the human eyes theyd appear to be a shroud of darkness moving forward to blot out the light. As the swarm pierces through the wind some of the bodies that make up the millions would fall in the hundred, but that would be very effective in stopping the swarms progression toward Armored individual Not sweating the situation the being would set forth another set of hand seals causing a wind tunnel to form, and this would blow back some of the locust at the same time blowing some back (those that took the frontal force). Noticing the position the being figured the swarm would like to form back, so he swiftly put together another set of seals. This would force his cheeks to blow up like a frog due to the air. And hed open the gates that is his lips allowing the bullets to flow forward.
 
With the execution of Wind Great Breakthrough came the Wind Bullet as the Gap closed, thus there was still gaping hole for a brief moment. And the Anbu Agent of Konoha would capitalize on this moment! By sending forth two explosive tagged kunais, and increasing their speed with a move formed by the clasps of the Agents hands! A great wind would come forward propelling he kunais in a tiny tunnel. As the swarm would be closing as the ninja performed his seals, but it would be for naught as the explosion would separate them without fail. This would not be the last of the agents effort however as the ninja utilizes his chakra flow technique through a giant shuriken. Which dices through part of the separated piece of the swarms as it forms back together. The swarm after this would do something different as they combine the group itself would veer hard left. To avoid the ninja altogether this was truly an odd phenomenon, but one that was over Or so he thought.

As the swarm veered heavy right a part would keep heading forward. It seemed as though the swarm was as a single being. Portraying what would appear to be a two headed snake truly a crazy experience for the Agent. As the as the swarm came in at a great speed toward the individual they would mimic a mouth and seek to swallow the shinobi whole. However, as they did this the individuals eyes would be hard boiled as it sought to live! In this moment as the illusion of the swarm made it inches from the Agents face. The agent would slam his hands together! This would call forth an immense amount of chakra to slam into the swarm, but that wouldnt be all on the success of this impact. The ninja saw the moment to go another step forward with the stride. Stringing together hand seals on the now dispersed swarm. As this happened the second head of the swarm of locust would swing around attempting to avenge its fallen head, but it would be to no avail. As by the time it turned around not only what the part that had dispersed been bulleted at the end of the seal, but so had the second head as it was rearing its head to attack. 

It was clear the swarm of locust was intent on striving forward toward the ninja and it was clear the Anbu Agent had chakra for days as he took on a swarm conglomerated with millions! Thinking to himself, (They just wont stop coming theres no end to these thing gaaah.) With the pressure on for both side the Agent removed two giant shuriken and allowed his chakra to flow through them. Utilizing two different currents around them, thus allowing them superb slicing ability! Hed toss these, but also add force to them and spinning speed by clasping his head together allowing a force of wind to apply itself to the shurikens. The shinobi was really showing off his combos as he sought to use this in real combat should it ever come down to it. But, there was one thing he wasnt considering the speed at which he was utilizing the moves. This wasnt quite the correct form of dual casting and thus his training needed to continue.
 
The swarm gathering itself even more quickly they would combine once more and themselves dense! Thus, there would need to be more force during the time of impact to even consider breaking them apart. Thus a ludicrous idea came to mind once it happened as there was no time to do differently. The agent utilized his hand seal, but he wouldnt release a jutsu just yet! As he would then clap his hands together after the success of the second jutsu causing not only Great wind breakthrough to occur, but Gale Palme as well! Being the first time though the agent wouldnt have dealt with them all together. Thus hed take blunt damage forcing him to be thrown onto the ground. The swarm would cycle around after this in an attempt to cage the being.
 
Anbu agent wouldnt take such treatment lightly however, putting forth the same hands seals as before the ninja is attempting to use the same combo once more. This time hed be channeling the chakra in heavier within his body. This was to cause a more devastating and full effect than the previous round he had with the locust swarm. Upon completion hed clasp his hand thus releasing the combo again and upon its release the attack would run to impact the beings before the agent caging him within their cycle. Rushing through the now open gate for better position the agent would turn while motioning his hands to do more hand heals. 

These hand seals would be no joke as he strings clasps his hand at the end of these set of seals as well, but it appears the swarm has learned and attempts to dodge. They did this by attempting to keep themselves split, however this wasnt the same combo on the release came powerful bullets being brushed up against by a power gale palm. There was no escape from this barrage by the swarm of locust. They could only accept the hand given to them by faith with open arms! A smirk would appear on the masked individual as he was amused by the attempt made by the swarm of locust.* - Sat Dec 12 05:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) clenched his fist in anger, prompting the cat to implode on its own. From the safety of the tree, made a simple hand gesture thus returning his sand to himself. "...Fucking.. Barrier." his true colors were showing while he was alone, his eyes scanning the building for any tags but couldn't see any.. He needed to get close, utilizing the shunshin technique he'd moved at higher speed, leaving nothing but a cloud of smoke where he previous was, and appearing infront of the house.

"Where... Ai you idiot." he'd taken a deeper breath, his anger getting the best of him where he needed to think and process everything right now. How could he do this? He'd channeled chakra to his feet, he'd leaped over towards the fence. Landing there he'd sway a little from the weight of the armor, but remained stable while looking over the building for any possible tags. He needed to by pass the tags, get in there, and protect Rias.* - Sat Dec 12 05:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) continued to search around the house, until pin pointing each of the tags utilized in the barrier technique. "This'll be the hard part... I may actually have t-" as he was coming up with a plan, the barrier went down on its own, the glow everything was gone."What? Why is the barrier down?.." the teen wasn't sure, either way he wasn't going to waltz into anything like an idiot. 

A slight grin formed on his lips beneath his helmet, "It seems, I'll have to abandone this armor to battle seriously." In the mean time, until he'd gotten ready. He'd held out his hand gathering chakra and sending it out through out the area. Reacting to the chakra outputed, iron sand was crafted. With the iron sand created, it quickly formed into a clone of his doffy counterpart that always worn the armor. This clone was sent inside, or towards the door at the moment. 

While the clone neared the door, he'd closed his left eye while channeling chakra to the eye. Iron sand appeared out of thin air, reacting to the chakra, forming an eye that was transpanted into the iron sand clone's eye. With this, he'd be able to see everything inside.

Since this was going on, he'd remove the latches on his armor, it crumbled away behind of a tree. His body covered by a mask this time was visible, he'd removed a scroll. Sending chakra through out the scroll, it unraveled a seal was visible on the scroll for a moment or two followed by smoke. 

As the smoke cleared, a gourd was visible. Which, he strapped back on and neared the house, but not to close incase something happened. In the mean time while he waited, he prepared more sand.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) watched from the eye lodged in his clone's eye socket, on entering the clone was washed away by a vertex of water, destroyed easily, leaving not a trace of it. Despite this, he'd noticed the cloak, as well as the face of whom the cloak belonged too. Ai was trying to defend Rias, his heart was hurting inside. With this alerting him, he was within a tree.  Possibly if he stayed where he was, he would've been swept up easily, he couldn't allow this.

"...Kana..." the masked guy thought, memories flashed through his head. The iron cork from his gourd shot upward, followed by an eruption of iron sand. The blackened sand formed below his feet, forming into a dense platform of iron sand. This platform raced into the air, avoiding the watery death.. 

He levitated above ground, "I-I... have to stop her." a single tear drop fled from his eyes, leaving a trail of tears from his mask. "I have no regrets.." he'd say to himself, while reaching out to Shukaku's power. "No regrers.." the tanuki smiled fro his prison, bombarded the child with his chakra, which he was able to hande since their contract or undertsanding over the years.

A large mass of chakra erupted from the masked individual, at the right side of his body, Iron sand materiliazed.. The right half was monstrous, reflectioning the tanuki, with a tal to match. He continued the transformation, until the left half was covered with the sand as well, at this point, his entire body resembled a minature form of Shukaku.

The tears ceased, his heart ached... A large amount of iron sand formed into a large fist, aimed to smash into Kana's body. Still, like the previous turn.. He was channeling chakra through out the area.* - Sat Dec 12 06:44:51 2015

His tail swayed from left to right, he'd watched Kana down like a hawk from above. A smiled formed on his lips the moment she'd avoided his sand arm, he wanted this. "You won't get away.." he'd spoken in a soft voice, even though soft the voice sounded out of place, demonic in nature. 

He'd willed the platform of iron sand through the skies at a fast pace, keeping up with Kana easily. Though, what caught his eye, was the next tail that sprouted.."She's losing control.." he'd thought, he knew full well of this.. It was like with Kastya, the more tails, the more they lost control.  As he glided through the sky, persuing Kana a wave of sand persued after her. He'd formed hands out of the sand, mainly to catch or trip the female up, as well as prevent potential seals.

Though if one noticed, more of the blackened sand was bursting to life, adding to the large amount gathered already.* - Sat Dec 12 07:54:49 2015

Though, he'd managed to miss Kana once more. "She's using he-" he'd watched as Kana's chakra cloak hand reached outward, grabbing a tree to avoid, then sling shot forward at him at alarming speeds. 

On its own, a large portion of his sand moved infront of Kana's body, it had to prevent the chakra arm, or even slow down Kana's approach.  The wall was formed, a little ways from the iron sand jinchuriki. Probably (five tiles?) the sand was alarmingly faster probably. Something that Kana didn't get to see while the two spent their time together. 

He' quickly formed the required seals for his technique. On execution of said technique, Kana probably would've broken through and continued her advance at this time. Inhaling he'd filled his lungs with oxygen from the area, as well as wind natured chakra. His lips parted, blowing outward he'd released a sudden gust of wind aimed at Kana, hopefully this would be enough to knock her back and away from his, back towards earth.

{Stratagem Perk} If she did get hit, and was advancing towards the ground. A large amount of iron sand formed into a hand, attempting to catch her like a baseball catch. If caught, it'd wrap around her binding her movemens.

Either way, if that hadn't worked.. More sand appeared on the ground, as more chakra was channeled through out the area.* - Sat Dec 12 08:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) looked up as Kana utilized the sand from his sand shield to leap over his head. He smiled, in his head this was a game of catching his lover? Or Ex lover now, time sure did pass. Either way, the platform beneath his feet spun around, just so he could've seen where Kana went. He'd turned just in time to notice Yuriko super soaked with a rouge jutsu... Was this a miss shot? He wasn't sure, but he remained focus on Kana and only the female. He wasn't worried about other threats, his sand would've alerted him of potential threats, as well as protect him.

On the hand, Kana was fleeing, racing towards the village's wall.. It wasn't going to allow this or faulter at all! He'd channeled more chakra into the area, more iron sand burst into life. At this point, he'd formed enough of the iron sand needed, but it took time to form the sand correctly. For now, waves of sand chased after Kana, trying to pull her in, trip her up, or prevent hand seals.* - Sat Dec 12 08:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) additional sand materialized infront of the boy, catching the water out infront though, the water easily had torn through. But this wasn't the only reason for shield, the masked man had a plan. A section of the sand raced up, his hands extended outward forming a shield of sand, hopefully this would've stopped Kana's assualt.

{Strategem Pek} (Since I didn't get to use it last itme.)

At this point, Tetsumi was pissed off. "...Love...." was the only thing that escaped his sandy lips, he'd closed off his sight of the world around him. His yellow pupils of the beast's shined brighter, both of his hands thrusted forward. Every grain of iron sand from the area, all of the sand he gathered from his time waiting bidding his time.. All of it formed into a massive wave of iron sand, a tsunami of the material. This tsunami of iron sand raced forward, demolishing burrying, drowning, killing, anything in its path while racing forward towards a fleeing Kana. The tsunami was high as well, there wans't anymore leaping over this, and if she did, he'd formed a hand to bring her right back down.* - Sat Dec 12 09:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) remained quiet as Kana seemingly escaped from his tsunami of iron sand.  As his sand aided in destroying the western wall of Konoha further, the sand continued onward, eventually meeting Kana's downed body. Unless she was further away from the village than he'd expected. If Kana was caught up in the sand, it'd smash into her body, as well as burrying her. 

Though, drowning the woman wasn't his plan, nore did he have the soul to do such a thing. Instead, he'd channeled chakra through out the sand pin pointing her body. If found, he'd form a massive hand around her body, the hand of sand soon consumed her body, up to her neck restricting movement. From there, he'd recall the sand with Kana's body in tow, he had business with the woman alive.* - Sat Dec 12 09:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Where... I can't let her down here... Not at all. - Sat Dec 12 10:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: If I put her here... The villagers will attack her, nope nope... Can't have that... I.. I still need to speak with her.. - Sat Dec 12 10:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) continued through the air with Kana in tow, he had an idea where he would've went.* - Sat Dec 12 10:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) on finding a private area, he'd manipulated the arm of iron sand downward, as did his own platform decline in height. As he did, he'd send the hand over towards a tree, placing the woman's body against the tree, back support, while the hand kept her binded, preventing movement as well as handseals of any kind. But, it stayed at her neck. Despite how the two ended last time, he still had respect for her and wasn't interested in seeing her nakid body...

For the time being while he waited, his arms were crossed. While Kana was unconsious, he'd blow out steam, the sand from his body falling away, his pupils returned to normal as well. His high reservers of chakra were there, but it wasn't at pongent as before. He stayed there, his arms folded, his mask worn on his face.* - Sat Dec 12 10:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) wasn't letting up on the sand bindings that kept Kana binded to the tree, it was pretty tight, barely any room to move. He'd rub underneath his chin before answering Kana's question."First off.. I want you to stop attacking konoha, or Rias. Why do you even desire to attack her? Isn't she weak enough?" his voice was much deeper than the last time Kana had seen and heard him.* - Sat Dec 12 10:25:00 2015
