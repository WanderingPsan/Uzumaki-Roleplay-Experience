<br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) thinks: Probably. . . - Fri Dec  4 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) "OKAY!" didn't have an issue with this in the slightest, he'd held out his right hand, turning it over where his palm would've been visible if it weren't for his armor.* - Fri Dec  4 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) didn't budge not an inch, behind of his helmet his eyes widened shocked equally of phrase per phrase of the fortune teller's fortune. Though he didn't believe his words, though he invisioned his old self strugling with various issus as Byrakuren said, yet he tried for it not to currupt him. Behind of his helmet he smiled before taking his hands away from Byakuren, and placing his hands at his side.

"NEXT?!" he sounded eager on the outside, but on the inside he wanted to move on, he didn't want to think much of the past.* - Fri Dec  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) folded his arms across his chest, he'd cock his head to the side for a moment, simply thinking if he was a resident or considered himself one. Honestly the armored guy didn't but he'd made a deal with the hokage."Ehh.. Not really. Maybe a protector of sorts?" he didn't want to get into that, that was another issue that hadn't need to be ventured into.* - Fri Dec  4 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) says: Oh, is that so? Sounds suiting. Do you enjoy protecting others? - Fri Dec  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Well... If I could! Ahaha! But. Don't tell anyone...I'm super weak! - Fri Dec  4 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: This armor scares people off, ahaha! - Fri Dec  4 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) says: Perhaps, but there is more than one way of protecting someone. You've found your own way and that's what matters. - Fri Dec  4 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) says: Besides, strength isn't measure by your physical prowess, but your heart. - Fri Dec  4 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) scratched the side of his helmet, "Greater good you say?.." the armored individual questioned."Probably not.. Its peaceful enough as is." he'd release a yawn thinking about working for the greater good and so on. That was something he'd have wanted in the past, but now all he wanted to do was vanish, live a normal life and thrive in peace.* - Fri Dec  4 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widened from behind of his helmet, Byakuren's words... It reminded him of someone from a past life."You remind me of someone, he had those same ordeals, but vanished on his village. But YOU'RE RIGHT! Darkness looms everywhere, in every heart. Darkness will always be around, but its up to people like us to notice such darkness and assist the person and guide them elsewhere."

he'd release yet another yawn, "But.. I'd rather make an impact from the shadows." he'd snicker a little about this thought, he'd turned completely around from the man. Attempting to walk away, "Maybe you could catch my attention some other time, or through another method." the chipperness of his voice seemed to have died, his voice was a bit more serious but the same.* - Fri Dec  4 06:58:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) scratched the side of his helmet, "Sorry if that came out.. wrong. I'm excited!!!! Hahaha." the armored individual's voice was distorted but there was joy present in his voice, and leaking out of his entire figure.* - Sat Dec  5 00:39:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) checked on the baby for a second once looking away from the two."She's a bit weird.. even for my standards.." he'd thought while remaining quiet.* - Tue Dec  8 08:58:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) released a sigh of relief once Hayate was sound asleep, standing up he'd wobble a bit from the weight of the armor. "I hate this thing at times." he'd mumble while wondering off into the back, where there were a number a shinobi, and a guarded room with care takers for the child. On top of that, the man was outside of the baby's room, on the floor seemingly meditating, one might've assumed he may have been asleep?* - Tue Dec  8 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: I'll catch you all later. - Tue Dec  8 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) vanished in smoke and what not, hiding his escape to the room.* - Tue Dec  8 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) opened his eyes, he'd raise his hands above his head while stretching a bit. So far, there weren't any threats entering or exiting his son's room.. So far he did a great job, though he wondered how the war went, were their any casualities? He was unsure, though he wanted answers. He'd look down at the child as he slept, then at the door."Should I take him for freash air?.."

Within his mind a voice boomed, making his presence known."You've become soft as a parent it seems, ahaha!" The armored guy released a sigh, he'd lowly say, "Shut Up. I have to speak with you later anyway, for now.. I'll see until then." after this, he'd focus on his son. With his hands extended outward, he'd wrap the baby within a sheet, after this was finished he'd form a secure hold around Hayate, holing his son tight against his chest or armor.

With this done, he'd leave the room. Which meant, he'd have to play a total idiot once again.* - Wed Dec  9 01:59:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: (Hmm... Well I'll try that.) - Wed Dec  9 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) entered the area, from a distance he watched as the child practiced alone. From behind of his helmet, he'd smile slightly. It was good to see that some people still had the determination to do things, to better themselves.. Maybe this'd inspire himself a little, but for now he had to stay from the shadows and watch everything unfold..

"WOAHHHH!!!!! YOU'RE STRONG AREN'T CHA?!" the armored guy called out at the training youth, his tone seemed over joyous, he seemed to be a little too happy.* - Wed Dec  9 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) says: Ahhh. .  - Wed Dec  9 02:40:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored individual blinked twice behind of his helmet, he'd take a step forward his child within his grasp while wrapped a little in his blanket for warmth.."Why Uhh.. Are you afraid of me?! I'M NOT SCARY! AM I SCARY? A-" he'd looked down at his startled son's face, "Uhh...." 

he'd bounce his son up and down, playing with the child a bit. From behind he'd hear another voice, his body tensed a little while turning slightly to the side, mainly so he could keep his sights on Kai, Byakuren, and the new face that appeared at his side. "Am I being attacked?" he'd ask in a frightened tone.* - Wed Dec  9 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) held a firmer grip of the child with his left hand, his right motioned up behind of his head, scraching behind of his helmet. He'd blink behind of his helmet for a couple of seconds, trying to see if he remembered Byakuren or not...Time passed... More time passed... More time passed... "OH! I remember you, AHAHA! How are you?" in honesty, he hadn't remembered the man, but chose to play the part, it wasn't something that was new to him...

"Hmm?.." he'd shift his gaze to the red head, examining her features as she approached. "Oh.. yeah.. Its nice to meet you as well." He'd slightly turn away from her, though still keeping a mental note of her presence, especially in thought.* - Wed Dec  9 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'd give you a baby, heh. - Wed Dec  9 03:07:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) stared down at the child for a few seconds, "At least he's happy.." he'd thought, from the child his sights were set on Byakuren."Err.. Soo.. Why did you come here again?" he was unsure, then he'd switch his sights back towards Kai. "Hey, don't be afraid." at this point, he felt mentally split between all of these people..* - Wed Dec  9 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Though.. She's cute.. so its worth it, heh. - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) remained quiet, he'd gave Akechi a thumbs up with his free hand, at least she got what he meant. Plus he couldn't help it, he was always a happy guy, he had to express it some how. He'd slowly approach Kai, hoping to not startle him much. His armor did make him seem a bit... frightning at times.  With his free hand, he'd extend it outward attempting to shake Kai's hand."I'm.... Well a friend. Don't be afraid of me, okay?"* - Wed Dec  9 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: (*taps that ass, flees*) - Wed Dec  9 03:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) "I have a sudden urge.. to kick him in his head..Hmm.." the armored guy thought within his mind, but he'd remain helpful wanting to assist him. He'd release a sigh once hearing Akechi's voice. Turning over towards Byrakuren, he'd simply reach into his pocket, dangling the charm he spoke about within his grasp."This thing, right?" he'd ask as it swayed (he made a necklace out of the thing.)* - Wed Dec  9 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'm going to kick him in his head next time. - Wed Dec  9 03:44:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: But anyway... - Wed Dec  9 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Back to you guy at the gate.. - Wed Dec  9 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) "Hmm? I still feel like this is peace?" he'd look down at the child, then around him.. Most of the troops were away for war, which meant more blood shed."No.. I don't feel like this is peace. What's your point?" he'd ask, his mind more open to Byakuren's idiolody this time or whatever he had to offer.* - Wed Dec  9 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) remained quiet through the entire speech, in his mind he'd say in boredom."God... he reminds me so much of Chiiyari...Peace, Peace, Peace, yada yada yada, peace... But he has a point." he held the baby tight, now with both hands  and his favorite blanket around him for warmth, it seemed he'd fallen asleep once again.

He'd look up at the sky, seemingly in deep thought. It was true, the world was pleagued. An endless cycle they couldn't have changed, he'd seen it all.. Would guardians that watched over this, and stepped in at times of need even be worth it? Would it change anything? He'd think back on Ride or Die.. though, it seemed like that chose to die, even the old fart Hassan decided to die. 

"Hmm... If you could beat me in a battle. I'd consider joining you."* - Wed Dec  9 04:32:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Hanging Shadow) says: A fight? Is that really what it comes down to? - Wed Dec  9 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Yes. - Wed Dec  9 04:34:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: You have to have power besides words. - Wed Dec  9 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Trust me. Ignore your 'good conscience for a second or two.' - Wed Dec  9 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: If you don't have power to back up your words, it'll be nothing.. Meaningless. - Wed Dec  9 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: You need more than words to make a change. - Wed Dec  9 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: You can't move or sway a mountain with only words. - Wed Dec  9 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: You need the strength as well... to do this. - Wed Dec  9 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: BUT!!!! That's words, i've heard from a relic of the past. - Wed Dec  9 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) "Great! You're begining to understand, make you're not much of an... Hmm... Well.. how can I say this?... Priest as I thought, even if it pains you. Somethings in this world, you just have to deal with, some things are required for peace, an equal of things."

saying this, he'd turn towards one of the ninja present in the area that remained."Could you call the child's mother? If she hasn't waken up as yet, wake her up." with that, he'd wait. Once the mother had turned up, he'd hand over the child and commence his spar against Byakuren.* - Wed Dec  9 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Plus.. I really need to know... how bad I've became. - Wed Dec  9 04:46:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Good.. that was fast enough. - Wed Dec  9 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) approached the hokage, handing over he sleeping child."Have fun..." he'd simply say, while focusing on Byakuren. He knew this'd be a drag.* - Wed Dec  9 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: . - Wed Dec  9 04:50:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Don't worry about it, ma'am. - Wed Dec  9 04:51:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) placed a hand or attempted to place an idle hand on Rias's shoulder. "It'll be okay. Just watch over him." he'd plainly say, while half facing away from the woman, his eyes focused on Byakuren."When ever you're ready."* - Wed Dec  9 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: ... - Wed Dec  9 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) brought his left hand up towards his face mask, it was a fuction that was connected to his face mask, the mouth piece of it. This helped to distort his voice a bit, but hindered him a little, like the armor itself. He'd throw the mouth piece backwards towards Rias, as he advanced a step forward. "You may have the first move."* - Wed Dec  9 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) watched quietly as Byakuren withdrew something from within his kimono. "What?.." he'd question within his mind, at this point two objects were visible in Byakuren's hands, though he couldn't make out what it could've been. After joining the two, the man threw it forward, his senses opened up.

The armored guy attempted to side step, moving to the side of said attack. Though his movements were a lot slugglish than normal, due to the armor that he wore. If he was able to avoid the kunai, he'd form the required seals for one of his techniques. Executed, a cool wind blew in, forming into several small tornadoes. The kunai that zoomed pass, one of the tornadoes formed around trapping it within it. The the other tornadoes of wind kicked up, dirt from the terrain swirling around clouding the wind tornado as it approached Byakuren. 

At this time, the tornado that held the kunai spat out the kunai directed at Byakuren's chest, it was imbued with wind natured chakra from the technique.* - Wed Dec  9 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) manipulated the tornadoes of wind towards the Kimono wearing man, dust kicked up, distorting his view on the man. "Got him? That was too easy." he'd thought, but just like that.. The man was gone, "Wahh?" he'd question, he couldn't have gone by air, so where? Did he turn invisible? Then it hit him, maybe he went underground? He was aquainted with that technique that allowed you do such.

"If he's underground, this may be an issue. But if he's invisible.. it won't be an issue..." he had his reason for this, for now, he'd jog around the area. Trying not to stay in one spot, maybe confuse him even. The weight of the armr weighed him down, leaving the clanking of armor with each step made. "Where might you be?.." he'd questioned, his eyes searching around the area.* - Wed Dec  9 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widened behind of the helmet, he was surrounded from all directions! A horde of the kimono wearing man trapped him. "Clones...HEH, I'M NOT AFRAID!" He'd jog up to one of the many clones, he'd throw a punch forward but his hands went straight through the clones, "Wha?.." he'd question, within his mind a voice boomed.

//-Voice- "You've become blind, its a genjutsu idiot...Humans.." 

Eyes widened, "I figured.. I should've known it was this technique.." he was just caught off guard, plus he should've known since he knew this technique himself. He'd stop in his tacks, the illusions crowded him.  "He's underground all right..." He'd run over to the gate, focusing his chakra towards the soles of his feet, he'd jump, the chakra boosting his step and jump bit.. Especial since the armor weighed him down.  Landing on the gate, he'd turn around slightly, his arms folded across his chest while waiting for the Kimono man's true self to emerge.* - Wed Dec  9 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) eyes went towards each clones, "Its just a genjutsu... I need to find the real one." his eyes went from clone to clone, each one withdrawing shuriken, brandishing it in their grasp."This'll become messy.." as they threw the barage of shuriken forward, his hands went up to his chest, incase he actually threw a real shuriken through. He wasn't sure, each one phazed through his body. 

From the cluster of shurikens, a strange one came into view, its sped on by. It had a greenish aura to it, obviously different from the rest."SHIT!" he'd exclaim while forming the required seals. Once the seals were executed, he drew in a large amount of air. The air drawn in fused with his wind based chakra, with the right amount drawn in his cheeks puffed up a bit. His lips parted as he blew outward, a powerful gust of wind was released, attempting to blow the shuriken off path, or hold it out in the air while he tried to avoid it.  Everything in his line of sight, was blown away, dust kicked up.. He'd make sure to put in more power, enough to overpower the wind infused shuriken.

"Need to move." he'd thought while attempting to do so."* - Wed Dec  9 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) watched from the fence as the dust blew over, he couldn't make things out at all. This, he'd try to exploit this. He'd jump downward, the moment he landed on the earth, he'd gathered chakra.. Sending earth natured chakra into the ground below, slackening it, making loose and moist. Followed by this, a river of mud was summoned forth, the mud rushed forward into the dust, the clones, and if the real Byakuren was within this mix.

Followed by this, he'd form another chain of handseals, forming the required seals for the Hiding like a Mole technique. With the handseals executed, the earth beneath him transformed into fine sand as he seeped into the ground, leaving no trace of him above ground. He'd sit down from below, thinking on possible strategies.* - Wed Dec  9 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: (It also materializes out of thin air, without me needing to actually have.. Iron sand.) - Wed Dec  9 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) "DOGS?!" the armored guy thought, at this moment Iron sand materialized around him, where ever they chose to attack from, the grains of blackend sand formed into a dense shield to keep each Dog at bay, defending the armored guy." which meant, he'd been able to to do both techniques in his previous turn.

From beneath the ground, he'd brought two fingers up towards his eye channeling chakra. Out of thin air, iron sand was conjured, forming into a bird that flew around, taking in everything around the area."..Hmm.. those dogs, they're going to be an issue. Better get rid of them quickly, then fish out the Monk." 

While the bird painted a vivid picture of everything around him, he'd make a few hand gestures. The blackened sand from the shield, plus newly conjured sand formed into tendrils, about as many to match as many dogs, their edge pointed and sharp. The the morphed tendrils moved fast, aiming to spear the dogs, attempting to frighten them into dispersing, leaving the fight. "Wonder if he's Chiiyari.. those muts.."* - Wed Dec  9 08:03:24 2015
