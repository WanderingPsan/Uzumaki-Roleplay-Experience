As he channeled chakra iron sand materlized reacting to the teen's chakra output, this conjured sand formed into an eye that quickly gained color to reflect Tetsumi's eye.

The iron cork on his gourd was removed allowing for the blackened sand to seep out of his gourd, this flow of sand gathered at his feet becoming dense enough to support his weight. A platform of iron sand was formed, this platform rose towards the sky racing towards the rampaing spider's route in where it was headed.* - Sun Oct 25 21:51:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) finally arrived at the area where the giant spider ravaged, he'd decend from the air a little ways from it cutting off its path."I can't allow you to keep destroying this place." he'd release a sigh, as he spoke a massive amount of iron sand erupted out of his gourd, all of it was manipulated fairly easily. The blackened sand raced forward for the giant spider's feed attempting to bind it, even if it was for a moment it'd be worth it.

(Stratagem Perk) It was time to put his plan into play once the giant's movement ceased. A another large amount of iron sand formed moldeing into a condensed shape. This shape was a large hammer, with a single swoop of his hand he'd attempt to bring it hard down upon the Spider's back hopefully wounding it greatly or killing it in the process.* - Sun Oct 25 22:06:56 2015

The rest of his sad gathered above the teen's head before funneling back into his gourd. Once every grain of blackened sand was stored back in its container a little bit of the material was exponged from his gourd.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) soared through the air above, he'd given a quick glance below noticing someone at the village's gate."Not my issue any longer." the teen thought while continuing his path somewhere within the village.* - Sun Oct 25 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) heard Kana's voice from below, he'd sigh a little. Though he kept reminding himself he'd quit or simply retired from being a shinobi despite his age. The platform that he traversed the skies on stopped moving, he'd turned it around and traveled back towards the gate. As he landed the guards at the gate cried out, "Sir, someone is at the gate." 

Hearing this the teen grumbled while saying, "Its not my issue, I'm retired idiots." though he couldn't help but to find out Kana's reason for coming to sunagakure."What is it?" the teen questioned, his arms were folded across his chest level as he spoke.* - Sun Oct 25 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) blinked twice seeing as Kana ignored his question, though she seemed intrested in his ability of flight granted by his sand."Mhmm..Yeah..its a handy ability. Anyway, what's your pourpose coming here?" his voice wasn't rude, just emotionless. He wasn't a heartless guy, he just was having a rouge time lately.* - Sun Oct 25 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Weird.." the teen thought while Kana analyzed him from the crown of his head to his very feet. A smile formed  on his lips for a second before it vanished, all trace of that lingering smile gone."Nice or not, i'd need an answer. Else you won't be able to enter. Ya'know its not my issue, I just chose to be nice for a moment and tend to the gate." his eyes were focused on Kana, though they were more focused on her head and mid-section of her body where potential handseals could be formed.* - Sun Oct 25 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sighed realizing Kana's attitude, mainly the rolling of her eyes. "I see...I guess i'll send someone for this 'Ortho' person." with that he'd whisper in one of the guard's ear his command. One of the chuunin guards, the one he whispered his order to ventured off back into the village in search of this 'Ortho' character.* - Sun Oct 25 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //chuunin arrived back on the scene, he'd lean in close whispering in Tetsumi's ear."We couldn't find this Ortho person." 

He'd shook his head understanding, the guard in question returned to his post at the gate. The ex jounin would relay the message to Kana, he wasn't lying at all nore relayed false information."They could't find this Ortho person, nore did anyone answer to the name." he'd sigh a little while mumbling."I always hated this job." though he was relieved that it wasn't his job any longer.* - Sun Oct 25 23:45:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) pushed out his lip a little while looking off to the west."And..Why would you do that?"* - Mon Oct 26 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Because I am alone too. - Mon Oct 26 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Though, I believe I can handle it better than you can. - Mon Oct 26 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) paused for a moment hearing she too was alone, either way he couldn't allow his heart to open up again. That was something he couldn't do, everytime he did this it was shattered and each time into smaller fragments."Maybe you can handle it more than I can. If you can, horay for you." the teen said with a hint of sarcasm.* - Mon Oct 26 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) saddness was visible in the teen's eyes, it surfaced the moment he heard Kana's words."The idea of being alone, its already settled in my mind." it were all lies though he was heartbroken. His eyes looked at the ground as he released a sigh, at this moment he noticed Kana advancing towards him."Why can't you leave me alone?" the teen questioned, his voice as well contained saddness.* - Mon Oct 26 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) blushed a little, it was just for a second but this too was suppressed his cheeks that gained a new hue returned to its normal color."The pain i've felt my entire life, no one would understand. And one person I did confide tthis information too..she.." his voice paused, maybe he'd said a little too much."It doen't matter." he'd turn away from Kana, his left hand motioned towards his chest. This hand was placed over his chest where his heart would be located. He'd tell himself, "Those words will only cause you pain if you allow yet another in." he tried to convince himself of this. * - Mon Oct 26 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) hand fell to his side, he'd turned around facing Kana once more. His voice softened as he spoke, "I'm sorry." he'd say this while walking towards Kana if she'd allow him to. The guards remained at the gate skeptical to what in the world their ex jounin was doing.* - Mon Oct 26 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I'm just hurt.. I'm sorry. Honestly.. I can't think straight at times. - Mon Oct 26 00:42:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: But.. I can't live with myself if I allowed someone to bear the same loneliness i've felt. - Mon Oct 26 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) focused on Kana, their eyes met each other the moment each of them alligned. Her hand reached out for his feet carressing it, his body twitched for a moment. He felt as if he should be on the defensive but his sand didn't protect him, neither did he feel threatened. For a moment he invisioned Madelyn but it vanished and Kana was there once more, his eyes shifted from her gaze once more before restablishing it."Maybe..Maybe I can help..Lonliness in itself, i'll nature it." the teen spoke while focusing on her.* - Mon Oct 26 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "She smiled? Even if it was a weak one..." the teen thought, he'd face to the side, his both hands folded at his chest he remained quiet for a moment."Mhmm.." pushing out his lip a little he'd say."Sure why not." though inside there was a small spark or ember that roared to life, maybe potential hope of the teen recovering from his depression?* - Mon Oct 26 01:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shot her a quick glance, "Oh? Was that the reason behind all of this? You wanted to enter?" the teen joked, he'd just reply with his name while walking into the village the guards parting the way for him."I'm Tetsumi." he'd whisper to one of the guards, "She's fine." before leaving unless Kana persued after him.* - Mon Oct 26 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) pointed off towards the square once Kana and himself got near enough to the square."That's where everyone else is." he'd say before departing from Kana, he'd decided he'd taken a different route than her one away from the villagers."Maybe you'll find that Ortho guy." he;d say before attempting to leave.* - Mon Oct 26 01:28:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Even though, this'd probably make it a little more difficult. - Mon Oct 26 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Maybe after you're done, you could find me. - Mon Oct 26 01:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 26 01:37:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) opened his eyes, the teen was meditating on top of a rock before Kana arrived.* - Mon Oct 26 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Why wouldn't I? - Mon Oct 26 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *shrug* Don't know, that you'd stod me up. I was wrong. - Mon Oct 26 02:20:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: What will you do until then? - Mon Oct 26 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Are you leaving to continue your search for him? - Mon Oct 26 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I'm staying with you. - Mon Oct 26 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Oh? Really now?.. - Mon Oct 26 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *smiles a little* - Mon Oct 26 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Is that a smile I see? - Mon Oct 26 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Cute. - Mon Oct 26 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Heh.. - Mon Oct 26 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I guess i'll take that as a compliment. - Mon Oct 26 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Funny thing about you. I saw a sneak peak of your smile, yet you're holding yourself back. - Mon Oct 26 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: No. - Mon Oct 26 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I don't smile. - Mon Oct 26 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: In your dreams. - Mon Oct 26 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) rose to his feet and leaped off of the rock where he meditated, his feet landed softly on the sand below. Once landed and having a firm grip on the sand below he'd sit down, his left hand tapped at an invisible spot next to him on the sand."Heh, maybe that'd be a nice dream. But unfortunately I don't sleep."* - Mon Oct 26 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: You gonna take a seat or not? - Mon Oct 26 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Heh. You're weird. - Mon Oct 26 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Why stare at me? - Mon Oct 26 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Is there somethin' intrestin' about me? - Mon Oct 26 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: No. - Mon Oct 26 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: You look like a frog. - Mon Oct 26 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) left eye twitched a little after hearing Kana's words, he'd repeat."A..Frog?.." his head dipped a little towards the sand below before restablishing eye sight with her again."Wonder if I should leave this place.." the teen thought while gazing up at the sky, his gaze was left there for a moment as if in a trance.* - Mon Oct 26 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Huh?" snapped back to reality after hearing Kana's voice, "No No. I was just distracted.." he'd allow himself to fall backwards on to the sand, his hands were fixed behind of his head.* - Mon Oct 26 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Trust me..You can't hurt him, i've been hurt far to much times for that to happen. - Mon Oct 26 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) in his mind he'd begin to count the passing clouds that passed his view, maybe he did this for a little too long since Kana seemed to have doozed off. He'd refocus on her, she seemed so at peace while leaning up against the rock where he once meditated."...So..So..Peaceful." was heard from the teen, from his view while sitting down he'd begin to take into account Kana's physical features while she wasn't aware nore paying attention to him for the time being. 

"..Mhmm.." was heard from the teen, he was fighting between the urge of messing with Kana while she was busy or focused on something else. He'd remove a pair of blackened dice with red dots lined through out them, he'd begin to shake them in his grasp before releasing the dice on the sand next to him. With the number revealed he'd grumble, it seemed that he wouldn't mess with Kana. If he did roll a specific number he'd have harassed her or done something to make things a lot more intresting, but peace was good for now.* - Mon Oct 26 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "She's really sleeping, gesh... What even possessed her to sleep around me of all people?.." the teen complained below his breath. For the time being he'd keep watch of Kana while staring at her ass. His face changing color once more, "No..this is wrong." despite everything that Tetsu lost, he still had his dignity in tack. He'd cease his gaze on Kana's ass and focused towards the sky thinking about happy thoughts.* - Mon Oct 26 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to stare above at the clouds, he couldn't help but to think of the future where his life was headed. He saw it a lot differently since Madelyn left him and everything else didn't go as planned. Maybe he'd stay this way, loney locked in constant arguements with the tanuki until the day he'd finally died."Mhmm..That'd suck." the teen commented while in deep thought, ever so often he'd peek at Kana. No not at her butt or features this time more as observing her to see if she was all right or if anyone desired to disturb her sleep.

"Wonder how long she hasn't slept, because she has to be a fool if she'd fallen asleep next to a guy she'd recently met." he pondered about Kana, she surely was a strange one.* - Mon Oct 26 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) jumped up after hearing Kana's voice, "Wha? But I-" the teen then realized Kana still may have been sleeping and in turn sleep talking. He could've felt it, her loneliness, even in her dreams it seemed to be taking a toll on her. He'd remain silent, his head rested back on the sand, his hands placed behind of his head.* - Mon Oct 26 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I promise.. I won't allow you to be alone any longer..*hopefully she didn't awaken and hear him* - Mon Oct 26 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Cute. - Mon Oct 26 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) face turned a bright color after hearing Kana's voice, "WHA?!" was heard from the teen, his eyes twitched a little as he focused on Kana's figure."...Were you even asleep..tch..." he'd get up quickly, and turned around his arms folded across his chest his face slowly regaining its normal color.* - Mon Oct 26 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Am I that gulible? Damnit... - Mon Oct 26 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: No-- you're actually so cute. - Mon Oct 26 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Come here, give me a hug. - Mon Oct 26 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) body froze up on him, he was obviously tense. His face retained its pink hue, its added color still hadn't retreated from his face as yet. Though he was't sure how Kana would take this, maybe she'd think he didn't like her for her position looking at him?* - Mon Oct 26 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked over his shoulder to peek at Kana, "You're faking again.." the teen thought, he'd slowly advance from behind of Kana. If she'd heard him most likely she'd have stopped what the teen had in mind. If he was allowed to allign directly behind of Kana his arms would've opened before they'd wrap around her, just a simple hug from behind.* - Mon Oct 26 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "This..maybe it wasn't bad after all." he'd thought while snuggling with Kana while she slept. The added weight of her leaning on him he didn't mind nore cared as much. His heart rate sped up a little, was he actually liking this? His arms stayed at Kana's stomach never once venturing elsewhere.

//Shukaku's voice boomed through out his mind, "Don't you ever listen? You humans don't ever learn will ya?" though he tuned the Tanuki at just for this moment, for a time even though it may have been brief he felt relaxed at peace in a sense? Nah not at peace as yet, just relaxed.* - Mon Oct 26 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Guess he's sleepin'. - Mon Oct 26 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm? - Mon Oct 26 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I looked -everywhere- for you. - Mon Oct 26 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Oh?...Really? - Mon Oct 26 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *scratches the side of his head* My bad. - Mon Oct 26 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Wasn't you ever told not to keep a lady waiting? - Mon Oct 26 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm? Not really, never had one to keep waitin' ya'know. - Mon Oct 26 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Its a bit new to me, sorry. - Mon Oct 26 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: At least its obvious she's intrested...Or is she really? Mhmm.. - Mon Oct 26 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Tch.. - Mon Oct 26 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Aww c'mon Kana I'm sorry.." the teen pleaded while walking over to Kana. If allowed to he'd give her a tight hug while she looked away, she was obviously agitated or seeking attention, though Tetsumi was more on the agitated side of in his belief.* - Mon Oct 26 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stopped the moment Kana raised a finger, his eyes followed the said finger as she tilted it from left to right. A blank expression was seen on the teen's face for a moment, he'd laugh a little. "My bad, My bad." he'd look elsewhere for a moment, the village truely was empty or the shinobi were busy. "Mhmm..I hear ya." he was fine with not touching Kana, though just thinking about the last time he did, it gave him a weird feeling inside, he couldn't describe it.* - Mon Oct 26 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Understandable. - Mon Oct 26 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Is this all you do? - Mon Oct 26 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Stand around and think about life? - Mon Oct 26 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Or train? - Mon Oct 26 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm? I train while you people sleep. - Mon Oct 26 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Do you even sleep? - Mon Oct 26 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Though, I do think about life freguently. Its become an awf-..Mhmm...No I don't. - Mon Oct 26 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Even if you're Insomniac, you must have slept atleast once . . Right? - Mon Oct 26 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm...Nope. - Mon Oct 26 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Well...Probably on occastions away from the village.. - Mon Oct 26 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Weirdo. - Mon Oct 26 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Don't you feel tired? - Mon Oct 26 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Heh..I guess that's true i'm a bit weird.  - Mon Oct 26 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: But yes, I'm tired but i've gotten used to the feeling. - Mon Oct 26 22:12:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Sleep on my lap. - Mon Oct 26 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) blushed a little, "I-I'll pass..Its not you but..I'd rather not sleep." he seemed a little depressed especially with giving up a chance like this.* - Mon Oct 26 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *sigh* - Mon Oct 26 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Why not? Sleep is good for you. - Mon Oct 26 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked down towards the sand below, his feet moved side to side a bit uneasy."Sleep may be good, I'd attest to that..Its probably one of the best feelings i've ever felt..in the past that is, now sleep is nothing but a nightmare for me." he looked directly at Kana as he spoke but the teen seemed distant as if reflecting on what'd happen if he slept.* - Mon Oct 26 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: . . . . - Mon Oct 26 22:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *nod* Nothing but endless nightmares, so I can't sleep. - Mon Oct 26 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I'd love to sleep but i'd rather stay awake to avoid those nightmares. - Mon Oct 26 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: What are in your nightmares? - Mon Oct 26 22:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Brutal. - Mon Oct 26 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shrugged his shoulders"Ehh.. Its life, but i'll deal with it. I've dealt with it for a while now." he'd avert his attention from Kana noticing a newcommer on the scene.* - Mon Oct 26 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) hands slid into his pockets, his attention was now focused on the individual that introduced himself as Toudou. He'd look dead at him, an act of showing respect while he spoke."Mhmm.. I'm Tetsumi, Tetsu for short." he didn't answer Toudou's question but maybe it was that obious he was or may have been a sand manipulator. He did carry around a rather large gourd on his back containing an unknown cargo unless someone had seen him in action. Even then it was a strange material that most ordinary sand manipulators didn't manipulate.* - Mon Oct 26 22:48:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sighed, a little. On the inside he was impressed with both Kana's ability and Toudou's ability as well."Kana..Please calm down, its my battle...remember?" from Kana he'd refocus on Toudou, "Your fight is with me" he'd simply clasped his hands gathering chakra. The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces enabling his magnetic field. "Its your move." he stayed in his same position, he kneens bent slightly with his hands clasped waiting for Toudou's move.* - Mon Oct 26 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Mhmm.. Is this how I began liking her? Anyway...Need to focus. - Mon Oct 26 23:17:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: It will be my battlefield. - Mon Oct 26 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm.." was heard from the teen the moment Toudou's metallic rings touched the sand, flames raced from the metalic weapon spreading along the sand in a circular formation tapping both him and Toudou. "Mhmm.." was heard from the teen, he remained calm as he deducted a plan. He could've gone with this two ways, which he'd decided he'd go with plan two since he wanted to analyze Toudou's ability.

Once understanding what path he'd taken the iron cork on his gourd shot into the air, with its release an eruption of blackened sand..Iron sand was seen, it was a large amount of the material. The material washed over the battlefield mainly around the manipulator from the sand where the flames incirciled him to the very air around the teen. A steady flow of the material continued to flow outward spreading the range of the sand. 

Though he wasn't content to leave Toudou idle, or give him the chance to either weave seals or use those weapons he possesed. Out of the iron sand sand lingering in the air it molded, forming into ten iron shuriken, all ten were doubled in size than their normal size. Each shuriken attempting to bombard Toudou, keeping him busy from weaving his precious seals or usage of his wheels of heaven.* - Mon Oct 26 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widened noticing the hundreds of chakram summoned, "Its time I take for the skies." the teen thought, reacting quickly a portion of iron sand gathered beneath his feet forming a platform of iron sand. This platform became dense to support his weight before raising the teen into the air, the chakarms that would attempt to strike Tetsumi and even probably injuring him.. The sand that was scattered about the battlefield, something he'd done in the previous turn rose up becoming rather dense. It formed into various shields or walls of blackened sand protecting the teen from potential harm, it wasn't even his doing the sand had a will of  its complete own.

From his platform he'd continue the large amount of iron sand's path below, it raced towards Toudou's position at its highest speed. What would Toudou do? It was a mystery, a mystery that Tetsumi would learn.* - Mon Oct 26 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Nah. . .They trying to kill him! - Mon Oct 26 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sight was hindered, he wasn't able to pin point Toudou's true location since the pillar of flame hindered his sight. From the side of him, a chalk arm flew aiming to potential strike him, his sand on the other hand wasn't having that. It'd race forward cutting off the chakarms path, if it broke through that section of the shield yet another potion of sand would brace the chakarm rendering it useless. 

His sight for a moment was focused on the chakarm aimed at that direction, the next chakarm that was the issue he hadn't taken into account. Despite this his sand cut off the chalkarm once more attempting to stop it from potentially hurting Tetsumi, if it did break through he'd either manipulate his platform of iron sand to the side avoiding the chakarm since he was aware of them or he'd attempt to doge them if the sand didn't move quick enough and it was up to his hightened reflexes.

He couldn't pin point Toudou as yet giving that the pillar was a hindrance, but this is where his plan came into action. Another large amount of iron sand erupted out of his gourd it gathered above spreading out across the sky. It looked as if a storm was brewing or it suddenly became night because of the darkness over head.* - Tue Oct 27 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Let's see how this plays out. - Tue Oct 27 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was actually having fun, if Tadou focused on Tetsumi or had to the sight required to pay attention to his features he'd notice a grin on his face. Grinning the teen formed the large gathering of iron sand into droplets, like fallen droplets of blackened rain. It'd cover a large amount of the battlefield as well as potentially falling on to Toudou's body.

(Strategem Perk) As the rain of iron sand fell, it was time to put his plan into action. The same sand, that Toudou deflected from before utilizing the pillars of flames that section of sand raced forward via the sands below. It would've seen as if Tadou had to issues to attend to.

As the rain of iron sand fell, it'd began to clump on to Toudou's hands first, preventing him from utilizing his charkarms or the usage of any ninjutsu. After this more sand from the rain would've continued to clump along Tadou's body until it incased him in Iron sand from the crown of his head to the bottom of his feet. If that wasn't successful, the iron sand that raced forward would do the same, it was checkmate.* - Tue Oct 27 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Its fi-" the teen stopped through his sand he could've felt the differance right away, to him it was an extension of himself at this point. Though he couldn't pinpoint the actual Toudou as yet, until..It was yet another chakarm thrown, it ripped through the air aiming to strike him once again. More of the blackened sand raced forward defending the teen once more from potential harm.

"He's good." he'd thought while pin pointing him, since a large amount of the battlefield was covered in iron sand, he'd focus on him. His hand formed a hand gesture as if clutching on to something, the sand beneath Toudou's feet formed into rather large hands restricting his movement. Though he'd still be able to weave signs, another portion of the sand especially what would've contained Toudou in his iron sand coffin spread out along the sand, a portion was heading towards Toudou's location, though he expect him to counter.* - Tue Oct 27 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm..the last of the sand in my gourd." the teen thought while taking into account of the situation below. Utilizing the last of large portion of iron sand he posessed on him, that was stored in his gourd it'd burst out of its container. It raced downward in a downward arc attempting to blind side Toudou from above while the sand raced towards him from below. Though he'd probably take into account the iron sand coming for him from above since the shadow of it was looming closer for him.

With either the sand from below or the sand from above he'd attempt once more to contain Toudou in the material. From the soles of his feet, to his neck. He wouldn't need to consume or cover him entierly in his sand, it was a spar after all.* - Tue Oct 27 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) smiled from above, his platform of iron sand decended from above until he landed."You're good." he'd give Toudou that, especially since he forced him to resort into flying. "Oh... And next time.." his voice became serious from the friendly tone he previously spoke with."Next time time you insult her, you're losing an arm." once said, he'd slowly approach Toudou whispering something in his air.

A smile was seen on his face, only for Toudou and himself to see unless Kana could some how see his face. The sand would crumble away from Toudou's body, after this every grain of his blackened sand funneled back into his gourd, it was stored away for later use once again.* - Tue Oct 27 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: I know she's rude but..she's really soft on the inside. - Tue Oct 27 00:37:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) after every grain of the sand was restored in his gourd, a cork formed out of the blackened sand into an iron cork, this cork was placed at the top of his gourd preventing sand from seeping out. He'd turn around waving at Toudou before walking over to Kana's side.* - Tue Oct 27 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm...  - Tue Oct 27 00:46:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) blinked as Kana stepped away from him."Oh..Did I do something wrong?" the teen questioned below his breath. He'd place his hands behind of his head , his eyes shifted over towards Kana until he'd locked on to her."Soo..What do you want to do?" he'd asked trying to break the silence between the two.* - Tue Oct 27 01:00:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sighed, this time he'd stay in his lane. His hands motioned into his pockets, he'd lean back on the wall behind of him, his head focused towards the sky.* - Tue Oct 27 01:08:16 2015
