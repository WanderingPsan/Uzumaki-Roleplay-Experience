<br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) laughed a little, something he hadn't done in some time..His right hand motioned towards his face, wiping away the tears. "I can still protect them." the teen thought, hoping the beast heard this.* - Mon Sep 07 03:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sayaka, Amu(RainbowForce) whispers: (sheena.fujibayashi1) - Mon Sep 07 04:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Wonder how well are the troops doing.." with that, he brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body clasping them gathering chakra. The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. A single hand gesture was made, it caused the iron cork from his gourd to undo itself. On it being removed it'd converted back into iron sand, melding in with the iron sand released. With the amount released from his gourd, it was shaped beneath his feet, as well as its density altered so it could support his weight. 

The platform slowly rose upward, taking Tetsumi high in the air from there he'd patrol konoha while monitoring the troops behaviors.* - Mon Sep 07 23:10:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) had enough of the battle below, it was just like the battle waged in sunagakure some time back. "ENOUGH!" the teen's voice roared from above, anger obvious in his tone, he was sick of the meaningless fighting from his perspective. At this time, a large amount of Iron sand erupted from his gourd over his head and manipulated in a downward arc hopefully being able to protect the Mizukage from potential harm from the attack. Still, more sand seeped out from the gourd but nothing was done with it as yet, it was mainly dependant on the shinobi's actions below.* - Tue Sep 08 01:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) felt disrespected, "I...Said...ENOUGHHHH!" his voice roared, in reality he didn't expect them to listen to him or even stop, he had a remedy to this. As if reacting on the command of his voice, more iron sand erupted from his gourd the sand formed above..From above he registered all of the shinobi whom were attacking, at this moment the large mass of iron rained down on everyone as if it was raining. The drops of iron sand's main pourpose, to stop everyone from attacking. The moment it washed over them and made its way to the ground below, he'd make a clutching gesture, as if grabbing on to something hoping to bind everyone's feet.

(Strategem Pek) The rest of the sand that rained down was manipulated, aimed, and focused at the shinobi's hands hoping to bind their hands where they were hoping to stop potential weaving of seals and attacks, like from the hyuuga or taijutsu use in general.* - Tue Sep 08 02:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Ahahaha! Look at the shrimp finally grown some balls! So, you finally goin' to do something about life huh? Finally going to become a 'man'. You're weak. You'll lose your will and your way. Just like you lost all your friends." words of the beast, those stung him deep everything he dwelled on those words. "Just watch closely." the teen thought, iron sand raced forward attempting to form a dome of iron sand around the Mizukage, the sand that bound him even was removed from binding his movements to form the shield..Could he save him? He had to, he was going to prove One'O's words wrong!
* - Tue Sep 08 03:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes caught Nigen's sudden movement, why did he dash in the direction of both down shinobi? Either way, he couldn't allow the him to get near or cause harm to neither of them. With a flick of his wrists, his hands moved manipulating the sand that raced after Nigen. Another hand gesture was made, prompting the iron sand he manipulated to wrap around Nigen's feet first, then the sand would continued to wrap around his body until it incased his whole being. He wouldn't even leave room for Nigen to breath if the sand's capturing and binding attempt worked.* - Tue Sep 08 05:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes closed, his head lowered for a moment. Though, he kept the technique in tact he wasn't going to allow room for Nigen to flee. Yes, he did give information to sunagakure about the possible threat that now loomed over his home. That was greatly appreciated, because of this he wouldn't kill plus his heart wasn't in that direction..He wanted to make a difference, save people, and preserve peace..How could he possibly do this? Especially with a sham like Nigen?"

He'd lift his head focusing on the Kirigakure shinobi and Dravae."Don't hurt her, leave her escape with her village's blades and shinobi. If this'll stop the conflict, so be it. He hoped this didn't continue, his patience was being tested greatly.* - Tue Sep 08 05:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to keep the technique intact, but he'd make a hole for Nigen's nostrils to breath from...He had to prevent him from being suffocated from lack of oxygen within the coffin of iron."I don't know the entire truth to this, but what i've seen is constant conflict from these two..If it'll stop over a bothersome blade, i'll take the risk. Peace is all I want, with all of us fighting each other, we'll never kill zetsumo and attain peace..Neither will we ever attain peace between us all, i've been a shinobi for some time despite my age..I've suffered so much, and I rather the younger generations be brought up in an area of peace." If his words got through to Nigen or not, it didn't matter most didn't care for his words especially the beast that he tried to reason with.

Though he was determined to keep the technique going until the shinobi of kirigakure were able to flee. To imagine he'd be helping out Kirigakure, the same nation that killed Jak. But he never forgot, but their actions of late showed they were here to help, rather than being a problem.* - Tue Sep 08 05:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) and with that, the teen wasn't planning to stick around. This was beyond his ability, he'd form a platform of three making sure he saved the unconcious Ushinawa, Nigen, and himself. He had to make sure those two escaped, then he'd return for Dravae who insisted to fuck this situation up even further.* - Tue Sep 08 06:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) paused for a moment hearing Ushinawa's words..he really and truely didn't know whom to trust. "Fuck it.." Nigen's voice, he ignored it but hopefully Dravae heard this and could wrestle back the sword and they'd make a retreat.* - Tue Sep 08 06:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued onward through the skies on the platform of iron, scouting out a safeplace in the village he'd lower the two down towards the ground."Be safe, ehh...the anbu guy most likely will find you guys." he knew he would, he was a sensor after all. And with that, Tetsu went off in search of Amu so he could watch over her while she slept, since he obviously didn't sleep.* - Tue Sep 08 06:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) paused for a moment, he levitated above on the platform of iron."I'm unsure if my beliefs will lead to peace, though I truely hope so." with that he'd leave. (FUCKING TIRED)* - Tue Sep 08 06:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Haven't seen Dravae ever since..." paused in his thoughts and reflected on that day after the events at konoha's kage mansion, kirigakure, their kage, and that other individual whom seemed bent on their sword."I told him to retreat..Ughh.." the teen cursed in his mind, "I'll find him." Tetsu spoke from his actual location, he brought his left hand over both of his eyes gathering chakra in his palm that remained pressed against his eyes. Iron sand seeped out of one of the pouches around his waist that he stored additional iron sand, the conjured sand molded into a small native bird of konohagakure it had to blend in after all. The sockets of the bird were blank for a moment before filling with artifical eyes to match, what the bird saw Tetsumi saw for himself. With a wisk of his wrist, the bird departed flying about scanning the village for information and Dravae.* - Sun Sep 13 00:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //small native bird of konohagakure flies about above, its eyes peered at Serge's figure for a moment, taking every detail into consideration."Mhmm..Not him." the teen thought, with that the bird departed to another location around the village.* - Sun Sep 13 00:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) small bird of konogakure scanned from above, its eyes picking up Nigen's form"Him..I can find him, but I can't find Dravae..." the teen thought while releasing a deep sigh from his true location, the bird instead continued to fly about the village..Still, there weren't any signs of his Anbu friend... He didn't like this, if he didn't get answers soon he'd even turn over what remained of konohagakure if he had to.* - Sun Sep 13 00:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) after Amu was safe and resting in a safe location, he wandered around the now concurred village of konoha. It was no longer under Zetsumo's rule, but how long would it possibly last? These were things that bothered him, would he return for Amu? Would be strong enough to face him alone? Plus he couldn't locate Dravae whom went missing. All he saw in his mind were the bodies of countless shinobi slain, things like the speech Orakuru gave before the madness. It was war, there had to be casulties deaths for a pourpose and to him they'd failed. He continued wandering around the village, the troops that remained did their various jobs patrolling the village and kept a kean eye for the God of War's return.

At this time in his wandering he came across a body of water, a bridge contructed of wood extended out giving a better look of the scene. He'd take the journey across the bridge, looking down at his reflection in the water, it was like a mirror. He was sad, despite finally reclaiming Amu it all slowly came to him..something had to give. Tetsu closed his eyes briefly, feeling the emotions that ran through his heart, it too knew this was true. Slowly he'd make his way downward, siting on the edge of the bridge, his feet almost touching the water below, they rocked back and fourth. 

It was a peaceful scene, life was like chess he realized. Both of his hands motioned up to his chest, both were held up momentarily before hugging himself..He had to remind himself that their was still hope for the future generations, even though if he mightn't be able to do much before...but that doubt was defeated on the spot, he wasn't going to allow it to break free, he had to keep his will and belief in contact. His hands were redirected elsewhere, from hugging him to being clasped tightly, his eyes slowly closed as he went into a meditative state. He'd attempt to reach out to the beast, if it worked...The beast's world would have come into focus, the same place..The beast remained behind its bars composed of weird wording, letters and meaning he couldn't decipher. The triangular shaped blades around the beast remained, still glowing due to its golden color, as well as the floor beneath his feet. * - Sun Sep 13 01:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm...Tch..its difficult isn't it." the teen thought as he failed to get into contact with the beast, though with his failure came a bird that decended from the sky above, a scroll was released from its grasp. The scroll fell on his lap, while the bird landed right next to him enjoying the view from where the teen sat."Mhmm?" Tetsu questioned before opening the scroll and reading from it.."I see, but I can't leave as yet. I can't find him." Though maybe he could relay his concern with Fuji, maybe even cut him off before he arrived at Kirigakure.

"I hate this.." the said with distaste, though before leaving he'd leave Amu with a scroll and a messenger bird. If she was well enough to make the journey he'd travel alonside the inventor to Kiri. Tetsu staggered to his feet for a moment, his hands were clapsed at the mid-section of his body as he gathered chakra. The staggering was caused by his feet falling asleep on him. The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. With a simple hand gesture, the iron cork from his gourd removed itself as iron sand seeped out of his gourd, the iron gathered under his feet, becoming dense in the process to endure his weight before drifting skyward away from the fire country. 

While drifting away above, he'd write something on the scroll that  Fuji sent to him. Finished he'd attach it to the bird and sent it bout its business to seek out Fujitora.* - Sun Sep 13 01:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to soar high above the clouds above on the platform of iron, he'd look before trying to register the area.. All the teen saw was trees, trees, and more trees nothing impressive. Coming into focus a flock of birds were flying in unison, heading off somewhere."It sure seems nice..to have all of that." Tetsu commented, his words aimed at the birds. The meaning maybe only Tetsumi would understand, he'd give a weak smile noticing the sun setting."Mhmm.."* - Sun Sep 13 01:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued traversing the skies, below he noticed caravans traveling along the road, though he wasn't sure if their origins soon enough the caravans were lost to him, he traveled at his own pace. "Maybe I should land, i'll take a little break." with that the iron platform declined in height, decending until landing at a safe place that had plenty of covering incase he was noticed, attacked by rouges, rabid animals, or something else on that list that Tetsu managed to run into in his lone adventures, though all were  killed in their attempts. 

The sun went down, he laid against a tree arms folded as he gazed at the moon in the sky. He made sure to hydrate himself and snack on a rice ball. Time eclipsed, "I've spent enough time here." he felt his energy as if his energy returned and he didn't like staying in one location for a long duration of time while traveling. Tetsu made a hand gesture, prompting the platform of iron below his feet to once again rise into the sky, in this case the night sky.* - Sun Sep 13 02:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Never noticed that before." the teen observed from above, his right hand over his eyes blocking the rising sun from blinding him from viewing the buildings below..In all of his time traveling to Kirigakure he'd never noticed those structures below, then again this would be his second time traveling to the mist village. It was amazing how you wouldn't notice something the first time, but notice it the second or third time. Then again, the height in which he traveled probably contributed to this.* - Sun Sep 13 02:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued onward on his platform of iron, the buildings that were once below were now completely lost to him. Though something new came into focus, more trees, but they were more far apart in comparison to Konoha's forest. Tetsu eyes were now able to witness the wild life better than before, he'd notice a deer skimpering about."Mhmm..Wonder how good my aim is.." the teen snickered thinking of testing his aim out against the deer. Maybe he'd do this as training while traveling, yes it was decided.

It was part of his training after all, he continued to flow of chakra and control it'd require to keep the platform of iron together. Another hand gesture was made, iron sand spewed from his gourd. Though only enough to form one shuriken out of the matterial. If he missed, he'd camp there for a moment.  The teen stuck out a finger, propelling the shuriken downward at the deer. Once it was on its level, he'd attempt to blind side it but it didn't play out as he expected. Chirpping erupted from below, birds of numbers crying out. This alerted the deer and it bucked forward avoiding the manipulated shuriken, the teen laughed and continued pursuing the deer. He felt the platform of iron decending, his focus was to strained on the deer and shuriken.

"Humph!" he'd reapply the same amount of chakra and concentration from before stablizing himself from a dip in altitude. The shuriken in question, which wasn't manipulated further collided with a tree below. Well, it was decided..He'd camp at that location.* - Sun Sep 13 02:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) landed where the iron shuriken was lodged in the tree, "Humph, you won this time deer!" the teen waved his fist in the air like an elderly man waving his fist at a troublemaking youth. "For now.." he'd turn his focus on the shuriken, on eye contact he'd open his palm. Causing the shuriken to converted back into iron sand, the sand was manipulated back into his gourd. He'd lean against the tree where his shuriken struck for a while, using this time to take a drink of his orange juice and scuff down a rice ball in the process. 

An hour passed before he decided to leave, the village was near and he wasn't about to forget his task in mind. Another and gesture was made, as the platform below his feet levitated from the forest floor, rising, rising until reaching a comfortable height. "Tch, this has to be my slowest time arriving to this place." the teen commented below his breath.* - Sun Sep 13 02:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) arriving at the village he decended from above, the moment he landed the platform of iron was transported back into his gourd. Out of the little bit of iron sand left behind, an iron cork was formed and placed at the top preventing potential spills.* - Sun Sep 13 02:50:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stared at Tethys's figure for a moment he didn't really trust his response..Did he know? Was he aware of what he did if he lost control? He wasn't taking any chances, especially around people of kirigakure..They'd treat him like a freak, just as sunagakure treated him, throwing eggs at him, killing his grandmother, robbing him, and killing the other sand manipulators of suna..He didn't want a repeat of this."Uhh..Huh..I have somewhere to be, maybe some other time." with that, he'd make a hand gesture causing the iron cork on his gourd to slacken. 

Once removed from his gourd, iron sand spewed out manipulated the sand formed an iron platform of the matterial below his feet. It became rather dense, enough to support his weight. And with that, up, up, and away the sunagkure teen was gone. Maybe he'd relax somewhere in peace until Fuji returned or someone else..But what could Fujitora do? Hell it'd probably be worse for him if Kenshin persued him..* - Sun Sep 13 05:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes shot open for a moment, that meant Tethys really knew about it."...." his facial experession sunk"How would I know you speak the truth? Sunagakure tormented me for five years. And it...I-.." there wasn't much for him to say, his step mother was like him neither of them could quite grasp its powers. But Tetsu was determined he'd tame that hot mouted tanuki, maybe on his own? He wasn't sure but he had to find a way, and quickly before it broke free. The teen was airborn, he drifted up a little bit. His saddened glance focusing on Tethys for a moment before attempting to flee the area. How safe was the teen if Tethys knew of it? Did the elders of this village know about -it- as well?* - Sun Sep 13 06:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Wonder what they're talking about...oh well, not my business. - Sun Sep 13 06:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) thinks: I refuse to allow these shinobi to feel alone; I know that feeling all too well. I'll start with Jiki then progress further. - Sun Sep 13 06:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) gulped, the platform below his feet contiued to drift away.."Should I trust him?.." he'd doubt this thought, though the jounin never held any ill will against him. He found himself at a stand still, he wasn't sure what to do or trust. His heart was aching. On top of that, spar with the man alone? He'd heard that before, that usually ended up in a death match from his experience. "I'm unsure if to trust you one hundred percent..Maybe fifty, but not one hundred. I-.." he couldn't decide, instead the platform drifted off elsewhere. Though as soon as it acended above, it soon landed somewhere near. If Tethys desired to persue him, it was piece of cake.* - Sun Sep 13 06:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Though, fifty is pushing it..I expected a new start here. Maybe it won't happen. - Sun Sep 13 06:21:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *sigh* - Sun Sep 13 06:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) landed below, the moment he landed the platform of iron broke back down and funneled back into the gourd. What caught his attention? His reflection in the water, it shocked him..The teen observed a saddened teen gazing into the water, as if in search of something that wasn't there."I won't give in.." he spoke to himself but his facial experession seemed dead for a moment. He'd think on exactly what he told the beast, he just had to stop bitching about his unfortunate life, lick his wounds and keep on slugging.* - Sun Sep 13 06:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) jumped a little startled by Tethys's voice, his senses truely had dulled maybe he became to reliant on his sand that protected him at every sign of danger? No that wasn't it, his mood funked up his abilities. The teen remained quiet, despite Tethys being well, who he was as a Kirigakure shinobi. There were truths to his words, the teen spoke up his eyes still focused on his reflection on the water's surface."The last person I trusted, disclosed these things, now she's gone."

Tetsu released a heavy sigh, in his mind he slapped himself. What did he tell the beast? At this point it was meaningless words, words to fill the hole he had in his heart. Were his friends really his strength and inspiration to continue on? Yes, this had to be true...Maybe..Just maybe he could open up, jus piece by piece for Tethys though how would he treat him? He had to open his heart, mend the enternal wounds he felt. "How much are you willing to open yourself up to?"* - Sun Sep 13 06:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) noticed Tethys's advances just from the corner of his eye but it didn't seem threatning, hell if the Jounin wanted he probably could've utilized shunshin, get in close and finish the job if that's what he truely desired. He listened in silence, hearing word for word of the man's testimony. It pained him reminiscing about that day, the day Kronos was back into a corner. Tetsu saw it all, he fell from the sky helpless as he watched his classmate and friend's demise..It drove him crazy on that day, after even witnessing this he couldn't exactly remember the events that lead up to him alone in the dessert with Kronos's corpse in his arms.

Tetsumi spoke up, "I was so angry..I lost control, that part of that I tried to contain..I couldn't hold it back, another one of my friends perished infront of me. I lost everything in my early years..My parents died in the early wars between Kumogakure and Suna. I felt as if I lost a major part of me at ten. My grandparents took me in, my grandfather Gintoki..I pranked him everyday, bothered him but he to left me alone...Jak told me he went away for vacation but the truth was he died..How..I don't know. Then..Heh..Jak was kind to me, like a father. I tried everything to impress him, showed off in the war. To imagine after graduating i'd be thrown to the front like that, I thought i'd die..Then he came, saving me and the others. Soon enough, he too died, along with his wife who protected us from being slaughtered..I became..much darker, I hated everyone. Yet again, I was alone. Then...Kastya, she treated me kindly..I wasn't even aware, that she was like me. She just..treated me as a son. She filled in my pain, I felt..Loved again. Though, I can't remember exactly what happened..But Sunagakure got attacked, I woke up in the dessert..I couldn't remember what happened, I came back to my village heavily dammaged, corpses of many on that bloodied sand. The villagers blammed sand manipulators for what happened, they eventually blamed me. Threw eggs at me, killed sand manipulators, then they did it.."

The teen facial experession darkened, pausing for dramatic effect."They killed my grandmother and raided my house and set it a blaze. I-I soon came to realize..maybe I-I destroyed the village but I couldn't phantom it. My freinds around the village ignored me, they even turned on me and threw eggs, just like the adults..But Kastya treated me different than them, with absolute love. So I endured, she herself couldn't control herself. I learned this..Its...I only remember chuncks of the incident but me and Kastya, my mother fought. It wasn't in my control or hers, I remembered glimpses of hurting her, her hurting me..I woke up in a dome, shinobi stationed by..That's when it clicked. But it didn't matter anymore, Kastya was around. But..she to died, left me alone it seemed. But that isn't the case, despite being dead. I-I know she's watching over me and the village." there was more, but he didn't feel safe talking about a damn giant ass tanuki that planned to break free and use his body for its own bidding..How could he explain such a thing? Some things had to be worked out in sequals.* - Sun Sep 13 07:26:04 2015
