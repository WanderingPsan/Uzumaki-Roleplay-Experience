<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked away frm the raccooon and Kilm, despite that he was able to get most of his anger out on the rouge criminal, he was still upset.

Hell he had an idea why, but it'd only result in worsening his situation with Kana, he knew the female too well. He brought both of his fingers to his mouth, parting his lips slightly he'd blwo out. An audible whistling sound was heard, it pieced through the area. Soon a black bird flew through the skies, it'd land on his shoulder. * - Sun Nov  1 17:57:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) pushed himself off the bench, he'd mutter."I figured as much." before leaving Kilm's side, he'd be heading elsewhere within the village.* - Sun Nov  1 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) brought his thumb up to his mouth, once inside of his mouth he'd bite down. Instinctively iron sand materialized in his mouth protecting him from self inflicted injury. He'd allow more flow of saliva to flow into his mouth, plus increasing his biting power to by pass the shield until his teeth touched skin. He'd bite down drawing the needed blood for the technique, his finger removed from his mouth as he spat out a mixture of saliva, sand, and a little blood. 

He'd formed the needed seals for the summoning technique, on execution of said seals he'd place his hand against the sand below. As he did this, summoning markings drew itself out on the sand around his palm, a plume of white smoke was produced as a raccoon was summoned forth from its dimension. 

//Raccoon emerging from the smoke, his sight was cleared. His eyes focused on whomever summoned it, noticing a teen with darkened rings around his eyes. He didn't say much, just stare at the teen.

//Tetsumi greeted the raccoon "I'm Tetsumi, nice to meet you." he tried sound welcoming and none threatning, this was an art he'd perfect. Though he knew it wouldn't be easy. 

//Raccoon silently nod its head, it'd run up the teen's pant leg. Darting up until he placed himself on the teen's shoulder, here he'd decided he'd take a nap.

//Tetsumi "I..I guess we'll train more after your nap." he'd sigh a little before walking off elsewhere around the village.* - Sun Nov  1 18:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyed down the small raccoon as it slept on his shoulder, he even began to wonder if the thing even spoke. Though he had no way in asking the raccoon since it chose to sleep. "Maybe I could summon another one.." he'd tap the raccoon until it woke up.

//Raccoon growled a little, the constant jabbing at his side was annoying. He'd open his eyes staring down the teen, wondering why it disturbed his nap.

//Tetsumi sighed a little, "You could go back.. I have other things I need to be done." he'd try to tell the raccoon this, hopefully it'd return.

//The raccoon on the other hand didn't have an issue with this at all, like that he'd erupt in a small plume of smoke. As the smoke cleared, the raccoon was gone, no traces of the thing.

//Tetsumi "Now.. I'll summon another one.. maybe this one will be helpful.." he said wishfully, he'd place his same thumb from before in his mouth. Biting down, his sand shield activated protecting him from self inflicted injury. The counter this and allow himself to break skin.. He'd allow more saliva 'spit' into his mouth weakining the chakra infused sand to a degree. Just enough so he could place a tooth on his fleash and draw some blood. Witht he blood drawn he'd spit out a mixture of saliva, blood, and iron sand from his mouth. He'd begin to form the required handseals for the summoning jutsu, once performed he'd place his hand on the sand below. 

In doing this, summoning markings drew itself on the sand around his palm. A plume of smoke was produced, as it cleared the same raccon was before was resummoned. It looked highly pissed, the teen's face was blank for a moment, his left eye twitched a little."..WHY IS IT YOU?!!!!...*sigh* You can sleep on my shoulder, i'll allow it." this time he meant it since it didn't seem he'd shake this particular raccoon.

//Raccoon gave the teen a death glare before dashing up his pants legs, up his clothing and placing himself on the teen's shoulder. There he'd settle down, curl up and doze off once more "Zzzzz."* - Sun Nov  1 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: This.. raccoon... is somethin' else. - Sun Nov  1 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) turned towards the voice, a new arrival into the area."Mhmm? Hello..." the teen focused on Yuudai, taking a closer look at Yuudai he realized he was probably about his age.. The same age to be exact, he was a bit skeptical why he refered to him as 'sir" either way, he'd pet the raccoon on his shoulder as it slept, "Sup." was heard from the teen on awknowleading Yuudai. Though he wasn't aware of what was deep within himself as yet, or had the slightest idea at that.* - Sun Nov  1 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm.." was heard from the teen, he'd notice Yuudai's stare going from either the sleeping raccoon and to him."There isn't much to do, that's why.." he'd use one of his free hands to point at the sleeping raccon, "That's why he's here.. All it does is sleep. Tch." both of his hands motioned towards his pocket, he wasn't good at conversation with people he'd just met so he wouldn't say anythin' else. It was a bit awkward for the teen.* - Sun Nov  1 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) picked up his head, it cocked slightly to the side as he spoke. He'd rocked the raccon a little causing it to jump to life, it'd start crying out curses in raccoon speech, he didn't understand it at all, though he could sense that the raccoon was pissed."Hey, Hey, Hey... Cool out. *sigh*"  he'd return his gaze to Yuudai as the raccoon settled down, its tail curled around Tetsumi's neck. Once more it'd return to its slumber.

"What are you gettin' at?" he figured at first that Yuudai was one of the villagers that were trying to rub it in or provoke him."Everyone looks at me weird, I just ignore em'." that was half true, he did ignore them at times, but at other times it'd got to him but now he knew he wasn't completely alone. He had Shukaku to annoy when boredom struck.* - Sun Nov  1 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) felt a little sympathy for Yuudai, it almost felt similar to his own hatred the villagers had towards him. Though, he doubt Yuudai destroyed the village more than once, what could the teen have possibly done? Especially to merit so much hatred as implied from his story."A monster? Why?" the teen questioned, Yuudai had peeked his instrance a little. 

//Raccoon continued to sleep, its tail slackened a little on Tetsumi's neck. Its grip on him was slowly weakening.* - Sun Nov  1 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I'm.. sorry to hear that." he felt Yuudai's pain, he felt himself in his shoes more than any other human around. Lonliness, it was there. After he'd went on a rampage, his very first one. He couldn't remember what'd happen, though the result of this was hate.. He'd lost his friends, manipulators like himself were slaughtered by the villagers. In fear because of the tanuki's rampage, they believed it were there doing, just thinking about it sent a chill down his spine. 

Anger was visible on the teen's face for a moment before it faded. He'd bein to form assumptions on the matter, though he wasn't even fifty percent sure. 

//Raccoon lost its grip on Tetsumi's neck, he'd begin to slip off falling towards the sand "Zzzzz"

//Tetsumi reacted quickly, displaying his level of reflexes to catch the raccoon from potentially falling. "What.. am I going to do with you?.." the teen questioned, he'd place the raccoon on his neck once more.

//Raccoon rewrapped its tail around Tetsumi's neck gentle, finding a nice spot he'd go back to sleep. Hopefully this time nothing disturbed his nap.* - Sun Nov  1 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) gave the raccoon a side glance as it slept, from the raccoon he'd focus on Yuudai's being. "Mhmm.. If that's the case.. I'll be an acquaintance of yours." it wasn't Yuudai's fault, he just hadn't gifted anoyone with the title of 'friend' in some years. If Yuudai truely desired to be a friend, he'd have to put in the work as well to win Tetsumi's trust and friendship as well.

"It was nice meetin' you. I'm Tetsu by the way." he'd say this while walking away, would he follow him? Who knew.* - Sun Nov  1 19:43:08 2015

He knew how cruel the world was, and it was obvious it was finally effecting Izanami. He'd brought his right hand up towards Izanami's head, he'd ruffle her hair playfully."Ya'know, you could smile sometimes.. It isn't as bad as you think." he only forced this, this emotion on the surface for Izanami's sake. He just couldn't allow her to have fallen to low, so deep into a march of darkness that he had trouble freeing himself from. 

"You'd better smile or else i'll nuggie you!" the teen said playfully, his hand tell on top of Izanami's head. Maybe this would change her mood? Who knew.* - Sun Nov  1 20:11:18 2015

The beast's voice was heard in his mind.* - Sun Nov  1 21:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) watched as Kana approached him, his body became tense. Honestly he expected to be wacked as usual, something that regarded pain, but that wasn't the issue. As Kana extended her hand outward, he'd blink shocked especially at her aparent embarrassment. His hand on its own slowly extended outward, attempting to grasp Kana's hand.

//Shukaku"She's only tricking you Tetsumi, why listen to her?" he tried hard to get into Tetsumi's head, trying to throw him off. Maybe if his will dampered a little, this could be his moment of escape.

//Tetsumi's hand paused as he heard the tanuki's voice. He looked into her eyes, sadness was there it wasn't hidden anymore. Ignoring the beast for now, he'd grab a hold of Kana's hand and be lead elsewhere away from the area.* - Sun Nov  1 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was ushered away from everyone, being pulled along by Kana they'd arrive at the large rock. He'd notice it, her voice.. It too on a softer tone than usual, his eyes widned as she spoke.

"...Our...Promise." he'd remember their promise. The promise he'd made to Kana the day he'd met her at the gate. He didn't want to forger their promise but, he'd gotten the wrong idea lately. Especially with Kilm messing up his date with the spiked water, that really stung.

"I won't forget out promise." he'd slowly near Kana, she was faced the other way facing the rock. He'd position himself behind of her, his hands wrapping around her for a simple hug, an embrace.Though he'd probably release this hug right away since Kana probably would've pummeled him for this.* - Sun Nov  1 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Huh?" questioned as Kana held on to his arms the moment he'd tried to pull away from her. He didn't expect this at all, he didn't see her fast not as yet but, with his arms around her he felt warmth."I-.." he'd stop talking, his arms wrapped tighter around kana, his body pressed against hers from behind. His head rested on her shoulder, for a change like the last he didn't feel lost or loney.

"I'll make it last." he'd say replying to Kana's words, even if it was for a little while he'd make the best of it. With his head on her shoulder, he'd take a look at her face noticing her bright red cheeks."Y-You actually.." he'd leave that there before reuining the moment.

"I don't want to break our promise. I.. I just.. my mind was a little clouded lately, I'm sorry. I.. I just felt bad for yesterday. I am attracted to you, I can't lie about that. But, w-what happened to my body.." his face burned a brighter hue, he felt embarassed about what happened.* - Sun Nov  1 22:23:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was pushed away from Kana, he'd stagger backwards a little."I understand..." he didn't blame her, at this time he'd notice Fuji and Zenaki arrive on the scene. Couldn't he be alone for a second or two? "An.. Why should I go to a sushi bar with you? Just take Iza, i'm busy." he'd say while focusing on Kana. Then again, she'd probably get rid of him now.* - Sun Nov  1 22:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) turned towards Kana, "Well.. If you'd like to come. I doubt its a big deal.." there were more to these words, but he wouldn't give any hint to the true pourpose of them.* - Sun Nov  1 22:50:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: What did you want to talk about?...*looks towards Fuji* - Sun Nov  1 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) heard his step father's words, he'd remain quiet. His face blank, he focused on the man but it looked as if he was watching right through him. He didn't dear comment on the 'marrige portion' hell, he wasn't even sure Kana was serious about the whole 'Father-in-Law' thing or just trying to ruffle Fuji's feathers or something. Female were a mystery he hadn't yet to understand nore a thing he probably would never fully understand.

"You're... You're an idiot." that was the nicest thing he could say at the moment, the other words in his mind weren't dinner friendly. "I don't care if you aren't the nicest parent, or couldn't express your way of love correctly. But.." he'd narrow his eyes at Zenaki's stomach, while pointing at it."And if that's another boy? What will you do? If you don't show em' love, attention, force em' to feel lonely. Honestly, I would've been able to deal with just that. But its more to it in my case, which makes it more dificult"

From Zenaki he'd focus on Fuji, his eyes cold but it warmed up a little."It took you..four years.. four years... Do.. you even begin to understand my pain?" he'd pause remember that Kana and Zenaki was present, he'd blow out steam."I forgive you." he'd only done it for Zenaki's sake, and the impending child. Making this would give the woman a sense of peace, and have faith that the idiot would make things better, do things a little differently. Though in truth, he'd already closed off his heart towards Fuji, but who knew maybe the key could be unlocked.* - Sun Nov  1 23:17:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) approached Sanoke, once at his side he'd take a seat on the sand next to him.* - Mon Nov  2 06:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wow. So that meditating didn't help at all? - Mon Nov  2 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) as he sat down next to Sanoke, he'd look up towards the sky. "Since you were able to detect the change in my chakra, you have a slight idea... somethin' was up." he'd sigh a little. He'd brought his thumb up to his mouth, placing it into his mouth he'd attempt to bite down. Doing so caused iron sand to materialize in his mouth, protecting said potential inflicted area. He'd allow salivia to flow into his mouth, giving him an opening to extract the needed blood for the technique. 

With this opening he'd bite down, drawing blood. Removing his thuumb, he'd spit out a mixture of saliva, spit, and blood to the side of him, the side away from Sanoke. He'd form the required handseals for the summoning technique, once done he'd place his palm along the sand at his side. A cloud of smoke was visible for a moment, as it blew over a raccoon, a small one by the way gazed at Tetsumi it'd slur some curses he couldn't make out since it was Raccoon speech.

//Tetsumi called for the raccoon, "Cmere, we aren't finished training." he'd say while glaring at the pissed off raccoon. The raccon only was pissed because Tetsumi kept summoning it disturbing his nap.

//Raccoon ran up Tetsumi's sleeve, he'd place himself on his right shoulder, its tail wrapping around his shoulder to support him. Though this time he didn't quickly go to sleep, he'd just watch Sanoke with some intrest.

//Tetsumi spoke up once the raccoon had settled down, "No.. It did help, but not to that degree. Heck, it still helps. But, I still have to prove myself." he'd say while looking up towards the sky.* - Mon Nov  2 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) face seemed blank as if focusing on something else, "In a way, yes... there are two me's.." he couldn't really explain it, hell he didn't even know how Shukaku got binded into him in the first place, though he remembered the day it happened. "Mhmm.. Yes, i'm able to use some of his power. Though to an extent." he trusted Sanoke, he helped him come to terms to a degree with shukaku after all. Though he wasn't sure if to tell him the whole and complete truth as of yet. 

//Raccoon on the other hand stared at Sanoke, an uneasy cartoonish smile formed on his lips. His teeth became slightly visible as he did this. It was obvious that he disrespected the raccoons, he desired to be dealt with! The raccoon slackened its grip of its tail on Tetsumi's neck, suddenly it'd attempt to jump off of his shoulder towards Sanoke.

//Tetsumi reacted quickly, he'd grab a hold of the raccoon's tail preventing it from attacking Sanoke."Hey.. Calm down." a drop of sweat trickled from the side of his face as he did this, he felt embarassed a little.

//Raccoon was stopped, he'd by his tail like a little play thing. He hung upside down, clawing at the air while sluring curses in raccoon speech "YOU WANT TO MAKE FUN OF ME?! I'LL TEAR OFF YOUR FACE!" that's what would be understod if one understand the langauge of the raccoon since he couldn't speak in human's native tongue.

//Tetsumi sighed while apologizing to Sanoke, "I'm sorry..."

//Raccoon continued to claw at the air, eventually he'd stop seeing he couldn't have won, cursed again and he erupted into smoke. As the smoke blew away, the raccoon was gone, he'd returned to his world.* - Mon Nov  2 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes twitched a little as Sanoke continued to mock the raccoon. In a way he felt bad for him, after the raccoon left he didn't have an issue with doing what he had in mind."Oh... you want to make fun of the raccoon eh..." the teen thought, he'd brought his thumb back up to his mouth. Placing it in his mouth he'd bite down, doing so trigered his automatic defense, iron sand materialized in his mouth attempting to protect the teen. In times like these, the shield was a nuisence. His apply saliva, spit into his mouth weaking the sand enough for his tooth to allign with his skin. Bitting down since his tooth touch skin, he'd break skin causing the needed blood to secreet from the wound.

Pulling out his thumb, at the same time he'd spit out a mixture of iron sand, salivia, and blood from his mouth to the side opposite of Sanoke. As he did this he'd form the required seals for the summoning technique, once executed he'd place his hand on the sand. Summoning markings formed around the teen's palm before a puff of white smoke was visible he'd mutter towards the cloud of smoke."You can kick his ass." he'd remove his hand as the smoke cleared.

//Raccoon had returned, with Jiki's order it smiled. "I'll show you about summoning trash!" it'd say in raccoon speech, which sounded like a bunch of rodent chatter. He'd rush forward attempting to chase Sanoke, he wasn't strong but he wanted to give Sanoke a piece of his mind for mocking him.

//Tetsumi let the raccoon to it, hell maybe it'd get som exercise from chasing Sanoke. "I'm working on master the dark chakra...Though its not as easy as it may look." as he said this he'd pause before addressing Sanoke's other words."Yes.. Kilm is able to summon them as well. He's..Well.. his raccoon recommended that I sign the contract." saying this explained how he'd even come in contract with summoning raccoons in the first place."And so I did." he'd focus on the raccoon as he said this, he wondered if he'd actually catch Sanoke slipping but highly doubted that.* - Mon Nov  2 07:19:28 2015

The type you'd probably find in your near by dumpster after you barged in on their territory.

//Tetsumi on the other hand laughed a little, he'd position his feet into his meditative pose, his hands remained on his lab as he spoke."Yeah.. he's somethin' else. Though I'm grateful, he usually sleeps. I guess you ignited a flame within him." he'd laugh a little, it was intresting seeing the raccoon in action even though he hadn't made any progress in catching Sanoke.

"Mhmm.. Honestly I haven't been the Raccoon land, or whatever its called ahaha." he'd laugh a little. "Maybe Kilm has?" though he he'd heard long before summonings had their own plains or world where they dwelled.

"Though, if I could. I'd take you eheheh. Once you take me to your turtle's world as well. I want to see how slow they due battle, probably take us a year until they're finished." he'd laugh a little making slight jokes of the turtle hermit's choice of summoning. He'd pause once again, he did wonder at times if he'd master Shukaku's power and establish a bette relationship with the giant tanuki. Though who knew, maybe he'd be successful or it'd be a failure. 

"I'll get it under control soon." he said with wishful thinking, it was best to be positive, something that he'd notice with the years that passed while a jinchuriki. Having a strong will and drive was thier strongest weapon.* - Mon Nov  2 07:46:46 2015

"Mhmm.. Oh? Are you really that much important in your summoning's world? I guess we share somethin' similar. The raccoons had so much faith in the teen, he didn't understand why. Why would they intrust so much faith into him? He didn't understand as yet.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I doubt it." his voice sounded cocky, this cockiness was easily wiped away the moment Sanoke displayed his speed. He couldn't keep up with the speed, he'd give Sanoke that. On the inside it made him a little pissed, it reminded him of the criminal himself and Hassan dealt with. Such raw speed, it'd be able to by pass his own sand and his automatic defense with ease. Though, he wouldn't let Sanoke notice this, despite if the turtle hermit could win out of sheer speed.

"I really should improve my sand's speed... Everyone has been able to come close or match its speed lately." he'd thought while sheilding his eyes from the sand that kicked up around him while Sanoke ran laps fairly quickly around him.

//Raccoon watched in awe, he couldn't belive that ninja turtle wannabe moved so fast. The shell that he carried really mislead him, "Shinobi.. I should've known, deception is their speciality." he'd calmed down by now but he remained stuck in the earth, his head above the sand. Though he'd close his eyes the moment sand particles were launched in his direction. 

//Tetsumi eyed Sanoke down the moment he'd stoped running, the sand slowly subsided."You.. could say that. Mhmm..." he couldn't believe Sanoke analyzed him to this extent. It made things a lot difficult for him, especially since he hadn't known much about Sanoke himself. Despite the apparent disadvantage he'd have, Tetsumi remained excited though his mind began forming plans, ideas to counteract Sanoke's speed. "This'll be, somethin' else." he'd thought while smiling.* - Mon Nov  2 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm... I can wait, I'm in no rush." honestly that meant he'd have time as well to improve on his skills, buffer himself a little. Hopefully he'd be able to contend with Sanoke's raw speed? He'd unfold his legs, standing up he'd stretch a little. He could've felt the differance already, he was seated for far to long. 

He'd shot a glance over towards the raccoon."You could go back, i'll continue my training later. //The raccon nod its head before dispersing into smoke, he'd returned to his home. "Why am I assigned to him?" the raccoon complained back in his world.

"I'll be waitin' for that 'bad ass' technique." the teen laughed a little, though he didn't know what to expect from Sanoke.* - Mon Nov  2 10:01:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) reached into his pouch, he'd look through his pouch for the scroll he'd have in mind. The cloth binding technique, a technique that he'd learned way back. It was the oldest scroll in his arcinal. Acuring the scroll, he'd toss it over towards Sanoke, "Have fun, remember. Return it when you're finished." Yup, it was the exact scroll he'd recieved from Jak ages ago.* - Mon Nov  2 11:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I'll continue my training now." the teen thought while his thumb motioned towards his mouth. With his thumb in his mouth, he'd bite down only to find himself bitting down on sand. Added saliva into the mix, it'd weaken the sand a little, enough for his tooth to allign with his skin. Once alligned he'd bite down drawing the needed blood for the technique. Pulling out his thumb, at the same time as he did this he'd spit out a mixture of sand, saliva, and blood from his mouth.

Forming the required seals for the technique, he'd place his hand on the sand below. Summoning markings drew itself out on the sand around his palm, a plume of smoke followed this action. As the smoke cleared, a raccoon was visible stretching out a bit. "Sorry to disturb you, but I'm continuing my training now." he'd try to aplogize to the raccoon, once done hopefully the summoning would be ready as well.

//Raccoon stared at the teen for a moment, he'd dash forward at him, run up his pant legs, his shirt, until he'd place himself on the teen's shoulder. This time he hadn't curled up and gone straight to sleep.

//Tetsumi smiled, "Good, we'll begin."* - Mon Nov  2 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I'm glad you're serious for a change, let's get down to buisness." these words were focused towards the raccoon on his right shoulder, the raccoon simply nod its head. He'd brought his right thumb up to his mouth, placing it in his mouth he'd bite down. In doing such an action caused iron sand to materalize over the potential wound, this sand blocked the teen from drawing blood. Adding salivia into the mix the sand weakened to a degree, he'd continue with his bite. Drawing blood he'd taken out his thumb from his mouth, as welll as expelling a mixture of sand, spit, and blood from his mouth to the side of him. 

Forming the required seals for the summoning technique, he'd place his palm along the sand below. Summoning markings appeared around the teen's palm, followed by smoke. Once the smoke cleared, five raccoons were visible summone forth from their world.

All five summoned raccoons looked up at the teen, wonder why so many of them were summoned into his world. From him, they'd focus on the other raccoon present on his shoulder.

The teen spoke up trying to break the aparent confusion on their faces, "I've summoned you all for training. I want to better myself in the art of summoning. Won't you all help? Please." he pleaded with the raccoons, he'd look dead at them.

The five raccoons simply nod their head, despite the training they'd have to endure this were their chance to explore Tetsumi's world for a change.* - Mon Nov  2 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "All right.. I want you all to survey the village." as he said this he'd turn towards the raccoon stationed on his shoulder. "Yes, even you." he'd have to make this clear, especially with him. 

//Raccoon reacting towards Jiki's words, it leap off of his shoulder joining the pact of raccoons. All of the raccons stod side to side along himself, waiting for the teen's cue.

//Tetsumi cleared his throat before giving the command, "All right... GO!" he'd fold his arms across his chest as the group of six raccoons dashed group of threes to survey the village. "Let's see how good they really are." the teen thought while watching the group depart.* - Mon Nov  2 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //Raccoon squad one dashed off in their section of the village they'd decide to survey at. Raccoon squad two dashed off in the opposite direction, both intended to survey the area in their established areas. They'd run pass shinobi, villagers, children a like. At key point they'd stop just to stare in awe of the sandy village. But, they'd quickly grew bored. To them, the village didn't fit to their needs, plus it was too hot. It made their fur moist from sweat. 

Eventually, both squad one and two finished their rounds. Each each returning to Tetsumi out of breath and down in a sweat. Tetsumi on the other hand felt bad, "I'm sorry... You all could return, get some rest." with that, all six of the raccoons returned to their world, for rest, a cooler climate, and water.

"Still.. its progress." the teen smiled while walking towards the square, maybe it had something to do. * - Tue Nov  3 00:10:40 2015
