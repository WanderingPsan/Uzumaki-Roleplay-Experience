"You asked for it!" as he spoke the gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. "I hope you're able to dodge." was heard from the teen, with these final words a loud 'Pop' was heard from the teen's gourd as the iron cork spewed into the air. 

Blackened sand, iron sand flowed out of his gourd, it didn't waste any time it one portion of the sand raced forward for Nina's mid-section, it'd form into a rather large hand, it was large enough to grab around Nina's waist completely, its grasp opened. If it were sucessful in grabing a hold of Nina it'd toss her off to the side lie a rag doll throwing her across the sandy arena.

Iron sand continued to flow out of his gourd, this sand was focused towards the arena's flow spreading the blackened sand along it, inhabiting it.* - Thu Oct 29 01:35:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) remained in his exact position, his eyes focusing on the seals that Nina formed. Analyzing said seals, he knew exactly what they were, since his younger sister and step father utilized the same technique."Mhmm..You've gotten serious, good." was heard from the teen as the seals were executed, she'd produced a rather large fire ball, despite its speed it was obviously hurtling towards him. 

He didn't seem fazed at all, he remained calm, his facial expression blank. His sand raced forward on its own, sand gathered, a large quantity of it forming a durable wall of iron sand to keep the technique at bay until it lost its kick. "*Yawn* You'll have to do better than that." was heard from the ex jounin, more sand erupted from the teen's gourd, this portion of sand formed into five shuriken that soared through the air aiming for Nina in an attempt to either cut off her path as well as impale her if she didn't react fast.* - Thu Oct 29 01:55:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm.." was heard from the teen as Nina utilized a wind styled technique to increase the leathility of the flames, as well as pushing his manipulated shuriken back at him.  The iron sand reacted, it raced for forming a larger wall to protect Tetsumi from potential harm of the boosted fire ball, as well from the shuriken. All were blocked easily by his shield of sand, it didn't even seem to have caused a dent in his defences.

"You'll have to do better than that." the teen teased, at this time his shield should've absorbed the blast from the technique. Utilizing his sand on the battlefield, as well as more iron sand that spewed out of his gourd, he'd shape the sand into a minature wave aiming to tower over Nina, as well as washing her away, mainly toward the wall behind of her. If the sand caught her as this was the result, it'd stop the moment her body collided into the wall.* - Thu Oct 29 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stopped his sand as it collided into Nina's body, she wasn't ready."Mhmm.." was heard from the teen as every grain of sand funneled back into his gourd.

If allowed to, he'd move around Ai and through the crowd that blocked his path, he just needed some time alone.

Out of no where he'd felt is body knocked to the side, though as quickly as the impact came was the feeling of warmth. His eyes focused on the arms around him, he knew the clothing and hand tecture, it was Ai. His head turned a little to glimpse at Ai's face, his own face was blank, tears flowed from his eyes.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Oh?" arrived at the training grounds, first thing he noticed well heard were the cries of the female infront of her. Though those cries turned out to be battle cries, she was training. His eyes went from her to the blade she possessed, "I see.." the teen thought while observing the kenjutsu based Genin polish her skills. It was the first time he'd met her, then again he was a lot free since he retired from his position as a jounin despite his age.

He'd decided he'd observe her growth, mainly out of boredom since there wasn't much for him to do. Walking over towards the western wall, he'd lean back on it. His massive gourd resting on it, his hands fixed over his chest. "Mhmmm."* - Thu Oct 29 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "She's training hard..Wonder what drives her." he'd thought while observing her weilding that heavy blade of hers. From the pure might of the weapon, as well as it weilded by the kunochi he heard the wind rippling through each slash. This is when he decided to speak up for a change, though he wasn't sure if she'd pay him much mind since she was focused training."Why are you training so hard?" the teen questioned, he tried to establish some type of conversation.

His eyes focused on her blade while he spoke, if she did focus on him he'd look directly at her giving her the respect needed despite knowing her.* - Thu Oct 29 18:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) scratches the back of his head as she'd given him her answer, "G'otcha I understand." his hands remained folded across his chest, he'd release a yawn from his being before motioning downward towards the sand below. As he sat down, his feet motioned into a meditative stance, his hands followed this routine. Both of his hands rose up to the mid-section of his body, there all movement stopped before his hands were clasped. His eyes remained on Chikyu as she trained, "And you're?" the teen asked while seated, he seemed calmed if she dared to focus on him, though his eyes seemed distant.* - Thu Oct 29 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) picked up his head, a weak smile was visible on the teen's face."I'm Tetsumi, Tetsu for short." he'd pause noticing she probably was getting ready to leave?"You don't have to leave ya'know," he'd paused while pushing himself off of the ground, his hands brushed off any sand or dirt, what ever may have attached to his clothing."I'd just go if I desturbed your training." his hands motioned into his pockets, if he did truely interupt her training he'd leave. He knew how it felt, so he'd respect that and leave if need be.* - Thu Oct 29 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) laughed a little, "I can tell, I can smell you from here." the teen joked, though he wasn't sure if Chikyu was the type to joke. Hell he didn't even know her like that, he'd only just met her after all. He'd stop in his tracks seeing as Chikyu may have been leaving after all since she needed a break in the shade. His head looked up towards the sky, "It is hot.." he'd mumble while refocusing on Chikyu, "Guess i'll wait here for whomever comes here.." he'd thought while leaning back against the wall, it sure was boring being retired.. Maybe he needed to travel the world again, though the thought of this sent shivers down his spine. His time traveling wasn't the best well spent time, hell he even lost Amu over that period of time of self enlightenment.* - Thu Oct 29 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I WAS JOKING!!!!" he'd cry out leaving her with these words, by that time she'd be leaving. The massive blade she carried blocked a large portion of her behind, making the blade's craftmanship a lot easier for him to make out. Now he was alone again, maybe he'd bother the beast or something to suffice the boredom he felt.* - Thu Oct 29 19:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Shadow clones.." the teen thought while observing the 'T' sign that Trill performed. Two physical clones were produced at his side, from there he threw a smoke bomb towards the ground distorting his sight on the three Trills."*sigh* A tactic like this again? All right, let's see how far this gets you." as he spoke he gathered chakra. The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. An audible 'Pop' was heard as the iron cork flew off of the top of his gourd. 

As quickly as the cork was ejected iron sand slithered out of his gourd. At this time his vision on Trill became visible or cleared once more revealing Trill's figure to himself again.. Though it were only one Trilliam left.."Below...But from where?" the teen thought, he knew they either went below or it was just a ruse..Though he wasn't sure Trill was -that- dimwitted. A large amount of sand flowed along the ground, inhabiting the fire terrain changing it. So far the area around Tetsumi was convered in iron sand, the sand itself continued along the arena. His eyes went from left to right, mainly focused towards the ground for the potential clone's point of entry.* - Thu Oct 29 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) mind worked over time, it seemed as if he may have been surrounded with various techniques that Trilliam posessed. A river of mud rushed forward for him where Trilliam was positioned, out of the mud river a dragon's head formed. It'd open its mouth revealing its jagged teeth, opening its mouth it released a rappid fire of mud balls at the teen. The iron sand that he scattered about in the previous turn came to life, it rose up forming a dense wall of blackened sand to protect the teen. That was a plus, it'd keep that rappid fire of mud balls there until the shield potentially gave way. 

Now he had to deal with the other threat, the second clone resurfaced. It slammed its hand towards the ground, summoning? A giant red and white falcon emerged, this falcon grabed what to be expected as the real Trilliam into the air. He had to move quickly, the quicker he cut off trilliam's potential escape, the quicker he could've knocked the boy back to the ground in his domain. 

He'd move to the side, avoiding the mud balls fired at the shield, it was incase the river of mud, plus the rappid fired mud balls didn't get him by chance. As he darted to the side, a large amount of iron sand was released from his gourd, it would be large enough to cover half of the giant falcon's body. It raced upward, swirling as it raced at its top speed. The sand split apart into two sections, one section raced upward to cut off the falcon's path of gaining higher ground, while the other section of sand was aimed towards his mid section potentially wrapping around its wings preventing its ability to fly. Meaning, Trilliam would be decending from the sky itself along with his oddly colored bird. Once the sand latched on to the falcon, it'd continue to spread until it covered the bird incasing it fairly easily in sand.* - Thu Oct 29 21:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "What the?..." the teen questioned as the earth beneath him rose up, it soon joined together forming an earthen dome containing him inside.."This technique again.." he hated this technique, since the last time he fought Katsune. Well before that he'd been stopped during a rampage with this exact technique. He couldn't stay inside long, his air supply was deminishing as is. There was nothing but complete darkness, he couldn't even make out his surroundings.

"All right, he probably has clones waiting for me outside..So..If I attack from above, I can escape that way and end this match.." he'd shook his head agreeing with this plan. A large portion of sand formed into a giant hand, it had spiked knuckles, it propelled upward destroying the top of the earthern dome. But.. On doing so, explosions rang out through out the entire dome, sending rocks as well as the child's explosive chakra about. All of that aimed for him, "Damnit!" was heard from the teen but the explosion drowned it out. His sand formed an iron dome to protect him, though this too was useless from the bombardment of these elements, he was in serious danger.

"Shukaku, i'll need some chakra." the teen thought while calling out for the beast, as he spoke in his mind, he reached out for the tanuki's chakra. Reacting to such a surge of power, iron sand materialized out of thin air, inhabiting half of his body, his left eye resembled the beast's own eye. A feeling of dread, blood lust swepted through the air, probably sending chills down Trill as well as Kilm's spine. A durable dome was constructed from the added sand, it shielded him within, on the outside he seemed as if Tetsumi had been caught by trills attack since he hadn't emerged and the debree from the rock dome covered where the ex jounin was last seen.

"Tch...Time to get serious...." he'd spoke from within the dome that protected him. Channeling outward, large spikes were shot out from the dome, sending the debree from the rocks scattered about, probably colliding with Trilliam's clone on the outside and probably the real one as well. The chakra source that he tapped into from the beast, it came to an end, the sand fell off of his body returning him to his normal look.

As the debree were removed and his shield of sand crumbled. A large portion of sand rose into the air, as it rose over the batlefield, senbons triple the normal side rain down from above across the battlefield protentially destroying the various clones and even wounding Trill if he didn't think fast.

(Stratagem Perk) "Trill..iam..." called out from the teen, a creepy smile etched along his face. As  he spoke, multiple giant hands of iron sand raced for at all the trilliam's that may have survived even the trilliam in the air. There would be two aiming for the trilliam that was airborne.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) hand of iron sand raced forward reguardless of Trilliam's plead. Its grasp opened up and grabbed a hold of the explosive user. Once getting a hold of him, the sand retracted back down towards the earth where he dwelled."Soo... You were the one that blew up my hospital bed a while back ehhh..." he'd manipulated the hand to the point that it bent Trill to an angle that the crown of his head was visible to Tetsumi. The manipulator brought his right hand up to Trill's noggin, his head as he nugged'd him. Just simply rubbing his knuckle against the child's head playfully.

"You got me with that prank idiot..Though... Well done." he'd make another hand gesture causing Trilliam to fall towards the ground on his feet or buttom. The air was covered in iron sand, he'd slowly walk away from the air leaving with out funneling his blackened sand back into his gourd. The strong magnetic feel the sand gave off died out, "Mhmm.. I'll make more sand." the teen thought while walking away, though he'd take a mental note of Chikyu. "Thank God I used that in the dome... I don't want a bad impression..." it was a weird thought, but it meant a lot to him.* - Thu Oct 29 23:13:29 2015

He'd look over to where Chikyu once was but she had vanished, "Wah?" the teen questioned until he heard her voice to the side of him."W-Wah...It.." as he tried to speak his face changed a slightly reddened color. But it'd fade away, he hadn't no chance at all.. Sad but he defeated himself at even trying to follow his mind, the intentions he had within. 

"I-Its...Its nothin', just got a lot of my mind." he'd say, the moment Trilliam tried to lace his gourd with his explosive chakra, iron sand materialized out of thin air over his hand preventing it from touching his gourd."What..are you trying to do?.." his timid voice turned to a fierce one, he'd give Trilliam a glare, a glare that meant death.* - Thu Oct 29 23:53:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm..." he wanted to say something else but it didn't come out. He'd leave her to her training this time instead of observing as he'd done previously, it was plain out creepy. He paused for a moment taking mental notes and comparing old ones of Chikyu's growth so far."You're getting better." he'd leave her with these words before departing.* - Fri Oct 30 00:07:15 2015
