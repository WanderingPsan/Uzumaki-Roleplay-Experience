"I'll.." he'd pause before finishing his sentence, he thought about how the villagers that knew about the side of him thought about him.."I'll do it. I'll make a better name for you guys, if it means signin' some contract... I'll do that."* - Sat Oct 31 12:37:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) brought his thumb up to his mouth, he'd slowly attempt to bite dow on his fleash in an attempt to draw blood.. Sand materialized where the potential threat was, sand materialized preventing the teen from drawing blood. He'd spit out blackened sand from his mouth, "Uck....damnit..." He'd pout for a moment, though he'd try once more. This time a little quicker, he'd place his thumb in his mouth once more. Not thinking about the potential pain if he did get through, he just did it. Bit down swiftly and hard, but this protected the teen from potential harm again, though this time he managed to bite down a little too hard causing a tooth to bleed a little secreating blood. 

He'd rub the tomb in the blood, soaking up as much as he could. Pulling out his tumb, it was coated in blood. As he approached the contact, he'd spit to the left away from Kilm and the raccoon. A smile worn on his face, the excess blood he'd swallow, his salavia working immediatly to mend the blood. Though it wasn't serious the blood would probably clot in a bit. With his blood, he'd sign as intructed by the raccoon even signing his name and all. * - Sat Oct 31 12:51:24 2015

He'd look over to Sanoke and nodding his head silently thanking him. 

"How will this go?.. Mhmm..." he'd thought while attempting to grab a hold of Kana's hand and ushering her over towards the restaurant he'd have in mind. If his hand was slapped away or anything of that nature, he'd still try to lead her to the restaurant with her following behind of him or to the side of him.* - Sat Oct 31 20:27:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sighed, he'd whisper below his breath."I won't.." while looking to the side. After Kana's routine threats to whomever he'd proceed to show her towards the restaurant. "Mhm.. Does she even like BBQ?..." he'd thought while venturing off to the BBQ joint!* - Sat Oct 31 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Texas Road House son... - Sat Oct 31 20:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) once arriving at the BBQ joint, he'd silently shook his head before entering. Once entering the people inside presently stopped what ever they were doing to stare at Tetsumi, these were cold glares. "Damnit..."he'd mumble below his breath, one of the waiters attending to the teen while stuttering."W-Where would you.. Like to be.. S-Seated." he'd release a sigh while telling the man."A table for two please." thus the two were escourted to a table for two, nothing fancy about it nore romantic.

Before Kana sat, he'd pull out her chair for her. Once she'd sat down, he'd push in her chair for her. After this he'd proceed over to his seat where he'd pick up a menu. The menu listed various meats you'd see in a BBQ join, ribs, chicken, por chops, anything of the sort. For drinks, alcohol, water, juice, and so on. It even had salad as a side."

The waiter approached the two, "What you you two like to on this fine day?" 

//Tetsumi on the other hand had an idea, though he wasn't sure what Kana would be getting."I'll have... some ribs, and a side of salad.. For the drink a tall glass of water.."

//The waiter wrote down the teen's order, before averting his attention over to Kana, "And you?" he'd have pen and paper in hand waiting for her order so he could've turned it in to the chiefs. 

While Kana odered Tetsumi stared at the tea bag that chopper gave him, he'd wondered why the raccoon even gifted him with this.* - Sat Oct 31 20:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: This must have been caused by Sanoke. But no, Could she be doing this out of her free will? Is she forcing herself to do this? Perhaps she wants to prove Sanoke something? Hm, Perhaps she's actually interested in him. I might be making this scientific theory thought though it does not bother me in the slightest. Will they find out what is in the tea? Will they find out how it works? The answer is the tea itself. It shall answer everything. I must be patient. This is so intense and so is the atmosphere around me but I know that I can keep spying without failing. - Sat Oct 31 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Will they find out what is in the tea? Since the answer is the tea itself. I shall be patient when it coems to this. I mustn't get affected by the atmosphere nor by them. I shall be patient. I will not fuck up. I am a spy. I am a detective. I have solved cases before. - Sat Oct 31 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: This is going to be a most particularly interesting case as of yet. - Sat Oct 31 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) once seated he'd reply to Kana's words, "It doesn't make a differance what you do think of me or not.. Can't be worse than these guys." he was refering to the waiters and villagers in one, he'd only did the gentleman thing cause he wanted to nothing else, no strings attached at all. 

He'd grin a little as the waiter scrambled off fleeing from Kana, "She is.. a bit scary." the teen thought while the waiter fled the scene to report their orders to the cooks. To compensate for the time it'd take to prepare the food, he guessed he'd try to break the tension and have a simple coversation that didn't require him having to die or attempted punches, or choking... Nothing of that nature, just a normal talk if it could be helped."Soo... Why'd you even ask me? If you didn't want to come, you didn't have to.. Despite if you didn't and I were to be emabrassed infront of everyone it'd be all right, I'm used to it." 

He'd stare at the tea bag as Kana told him to 'chuck that thing', though he didn't want to offend chopper.. He didn't want this in the slightest, "Mhmm... Wonder if its good tea." he'd thought while staring at the tea bag in his grasp.* - Sat Oct 31 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm..." he'd reach out for his cup as well nervously, he'd drink a good bit of the water nervously. At this exact time, the waiter returned with their ribs, and side of salad each. "Thank You." he'd reply to the waiter before the man left. He'd turn his attention towards Kana, as he did so he'd felt a sensation sweeping over him, it crepted in..."W-Wah.. this.. doesn't feel right?" unknowingly, it was the cause of the water that invoked.. whomever that drank it to become quite horney..

The teen looked away from Kana, and towards his food. With fork and knife in hand he'd begin to cut away at the meat of the ribs. He'd cut it down in any cuts before eating.* - Sat Oct 31 21:49:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) watched the water oddly, he hadn't finished his glass but the more he'd drank of it the worse..the worse his situation became. His cheeks burned bright red in color, he'd hear Kana's words but he felt so hot inside.. Just looking at the female drove him crazy, blood rushed to his penis, increasing its size in his pants, the result of the herbs inside of the water."N-Not as tasty a-" he'd caught himself, "What the hell is going on?..." he'd questioned in his mind, his body twitched as he tried his best to resist the urge. Though unlike Kana, he wasn't trained nore disaplained as her, he was losing an internal battle.

"I-I just want to..." just the thought of what ever the teen was thinking caused the buldge in his pants to grow in size, though thanks to the table this wasn't detected as yet. He'd continue to eat from the cut up, ribs while keeping Kana out of his sight."The ribs.. they're good.." his voice seemed saddened, he knew if this urge or sensation he'd felt corrupted his mind, he wouldn't have a shot at asking Kana out, nope not at all. Instead he'd probably be in a morgue when Kana was finished with him.

His right hand motioned towards his lap, resting over his penis to cover it as well as message it gently..."W-What in the hell?...This isn't me..." he'd say in his mind, it sucked being virgin that wasn't aware of these things.* - Sat Oct 31 22:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was being torn inside and out internally, he couldn't think straight with Kana around. He'd look up the moment water gushed out of her mouth and washing over a by stander? Just watching Kana, he'd stripped the female with his eyes invisioning how she'd look nakid. He'd try to shake this feeling off, his hand that gentle rubbed against his penis stopped. Taking a closer look at whom Kana struck he'd recognize the raccoon chopper first.."Why a-..are they here.." his words were forced, he'd stand up erect ready to jump into action. 

Though, something else seemed to have been ready to jump into action as well. At his zipper, a massive buldge was visible, it looked as if the teen had a minature sword drawn ready for combat.. He'd feel the differance, his eyes flowed down to zipper noticing the change. There was silence, his face lost color for a moment he was embarassed.. If Kana even looked at him, she'd see it.. He was attracted to her but, this was different, a little too intense than before.

His eyes twitched for a moment, "What...did...you...guys do?...." his voice wasn't steady, it was difficult for him not to speak in a lustful tone.* - Sat Oct 31 23:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) reacted as quickly as his mind could, an impending attack was coming for Kana. By the time he reacted though it would've overpowered her own water technique and probably pushing her back a little? Using this time he'd jogg behind of her, opening his arms he attempted to catch her and somewhat brace the recoil from said technique. He'd be positioned right behind of her, this..made things worse on his part since the lust overcame him. His penis stod up jabbing against her ass. Though he didn't let go of her as yet, "W-What...What am I?..." he couldn't think straight, his eyes were filled with lust as he stared at Kana. 

Tetsumi wasn't himself at all, and he'd probably suffer a hella lot of pain thanks to the herbs that spiked his drink... Kana would kick his ass, it was destiny.. His ass was destined to be kicked.* - Sat Oct 31 23:37:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was pushed down towards the floor, he didn't expect it. He'd grunt a little, the pain made him think straight a little. He'd look up once more, his eyes picking up Kana's figure once more. His body was heated, he wanted to feel every fiber of Kana but there was a smidge of dignity left inside him. "I-I can't.." he'd stutter as he watched Kana dead in her eyes. At this time chopper rushed in with two new pairs of antidotes attempting to suppress the lustful urges that the herbs within the spiked drinks had given off. 

He'd be forced fed the antidote, though if it'd begin right away was a mystery.* - Sun Nov  1 00:05:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) remained on the ground, even then after the atidote was flushing out the herbs ability his sensation of lust was replaced with sadness.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) watched as Kana left, the moment she left a silent tear shed from his left eye.. After that, no more tears fell or even formed.

After about ten minutes after Kana left, he'd get up and leave himself.* - Sun Nov  1 00:34:33 2015

At this point he didn't care himself, he'd make a hand gesture prompting the iron sand to form into a massive fist that raced forward at the wall behind of him completely destroying it leaving an exit for him to go through. The blackened sand funneled back into his gourd as he attempted to leave the restaurant through this make shift exit he'd made.* - Sun Nov  1 00:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "All right.. Let me explain my plan." the ex jounin spoke while heading towards the criminal, Hassan at his side. "He's a taijutsu specialist, and he has that same eye Koji, Mirai and the other possess. So he'll see us coming. But, i'll start off the attack with simple clones. He'll take them as bait, when he does. I'll utilize a genjutsu that will make endless clones the moment he continues fighting. The sand from the destoyed clones, i'll use it to make ninja tools to make it seem.. a little more realistic. Hopefully this'll occupy him while you guys come in.. But.. its probably a stupid plan...." he figured this'd work after analyzing the man's fighting style while he fought everyone in the previous scuffle.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "All right, the fun begins!" he'd thought as Hassan intiated the first attack. A powerful blast of wind, this blast of wind would be his opening for a combo strike. Though he didn't expect much from it, or for it to be this easy. A thin smile formed along his blank expressionless face, his hands moved swiftly to the mid-section of his body. As his hands moved to the pont of his body, chakra gathered. Forcefully he'd brought his hands together clapping his hands forcefully, this caused the chakra to convert into magnetic forces enabling his magnetic field.

With said field activated, an audible 'POP' was heard from the teen's gourd as the iron cork flew into the air. An eruption of blackened sand, iron sand was visible ejected from the teen's gourd. It was a large amount of the material, trying to compensate for Hassan's wind styled technique, he'd begin to mold the sand changing its shape. It raced forward behind, above, where ever Tribus desired to go. This was meant to block off his path, hindering an escape route as well as if he was caught in the technique an added dammage radious from the desired shape he was froming the sand into. 

The large amount of sand formed into a large hand, there were large spikes visible worn like brass knuckles, this hand attempted to impale the hyuuga criminal inflicting blunt and piercing dammage.* - Sun Nov  1 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) blinked as the man vanished from his sight, "W-" before he could've even finished his train of thought, his sand tried to move on its own though it wouldn't be able to keep up with the Hyuuga's speed. He had to rely on his last defence, iron sand itself formed over his skin enhancing his ability to have taken a heavier blow than usual. With the iron sand armor in place, it braced the kick but the teen was still sent flying upward like a rag doll. His hands seemed limp, he'd squaint as he glanced at the man again. "I'm not.. weak..." he'd thought while airborn.

In the air, he groaned he felt the loss of chakra from the kick it was obvious.. In his mind he'd heart a booming voice, "You're fool if you're going to let him toss you around like that!!!!! BAKA!!!" the tanuki seemed pissed in his tone. No.. he couldn't lose. As the man attempted or prepared the follow through he'd yell from above"DON'T TAKE ME LIGHTLY!" a large amount of chakra washed over the teen, it sent a feeling of dread and blood lust into the air. Iron sand materialized along his left side of his body, it continued to spread gifting him with a tail to match the tanuki's own. The blackened sand continued to spread along his body until he resembled a minature version of the beast.

Addition sand was summoned fourth, more of the sand spewed out of his gourd and the sand from the previous attack was recalled. Out of a portion of the sand, twenty shuriken doubled in size raced forward for the man, at this time he'd wait for him. He expect him and he'd counter effectively.* - Sun Nov  1 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes of the beast focused on the criminal, he neared him with potential attacks. This was his down fall, he underestimated him, this would lead to the man's own demise. The cloak of shukaku became spiky, through out the entire sand even to the tail itself, simple manipulation was the cause of this. If the man proceeded to attack, he'd sustain injuries from just punching the teen. With this obstacle taken care of, he'd swing his left hand outward attempting to bind the man with his over new arm.. An arm that resembled the beast, and because it was made entierly of iron and, it extended outward an an alarming speed from the man attempting to bind him in place. Once done, the sand would've continued to spread along his body.

If any attempts of him escaping or trying to break free, he'd set it off sending a surge of chakra through out the sand attempting to intiate iron sand burial to crush what ever his hand that resembled the beast had covered. More sand raced through out the air, preparing for something else.* - Sun Nov  1 09:06:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) seeing as Hassan reacted quickly, most likely intercepting the criminal's initial plan he'd move into action while hassan attempted to use the two fingered wind charged technique. The large gathering of sand that he summoned from all of his time preparing it, gathered clustered around the area around, himself, hassan, and the criminal. Out of the sand, large spikes rose up behind of the man, it was controlled so tha it wouldn't pierce Hassan by accident. These spikes sprouted behind of Tribus's back attempting to impale, run him straight through.

{Stratagem Turn} "I WANT TO SEE YOU SUFFER!!!" the teen announced, his actions were controlled but he felt thrilled from the surge of power from the beast. More sand raced forward for Tribus's mouth while a his hand extended outward to wrap around his neck squeezing tight preventing oxygen into his lungs and causing him to gasp for air. If this was possible, his sand would funnel, force its way into the shinobi's body a good amount of it. Settling in his body, it'd take shape into spikes causing internal dammage. He may have been a tank on the outside, but how about on the inside?!* - Sun Nov  1 09:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: He's dead? - Sun Nov  1 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Oh hell now. - Sun Nov  1 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) never once left the man's gaze, his eyes that resembled shukaku himself stayed trained on him like a hawk. With the slightest movement from the aparently dead man, he'd holler out in delight"YOU'RE STILL ALIVE?!" as his hand extended outward for his neck, sand moved on its own attempting to work as a safeguard to protect Tetsumi from such an attack. Manipulating the iron sand tha he force fed him before, he'd increase the spikes within the scum. This caused numerous spikes to pierce through him from the inside out, hell even impaling his very heart, the spikes in itself would stop the moment it broke three inches through his skin if possible.

The hand that he extended outward, he'd change the shape of his monstrous arm, into a large rotating saw. He'd attempt to bring this rotating saw towards the man extended hand in an attempt to cut it clean off, blood would platter as he did this, a phychotic smile stretching across his monstrous face as he did just this. He had full control yes, but he was enjoying this.* - Sun Nov  1 10:05:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked over towards Sanoke as he commented due to his transformed state, though he hadn't said anything reguarding such a thing. Everyone saw him for what he truely was now, he felt like an alien to an extent. 

In his mind he'd comment, "Tch, how was that?" A voice boomed back replying to the teen's question, //Shukaku"You held back. I wanted a swing at him."

He'd laugh a little to himself, which probably made him seem even crazier even. The iron sand cloak of sand crumbled away, he'd stopped tapping into the tanuki's power. The sand from his very body fell off, his pupils returned to normal. Once again, his outward appearance resembled the same old Tetsumi, his gourd was visible on his back, though it seemed smaller than usual. 

"Mhmm.." he'd look towards the floor as every grain of iron sand returned to the teen's figure, the sand funneled back into the gourd, as well as increasing the size of the gourd that contained his sand. His gourd was back to its normal size, and his iron sand stored away. More sand materialized, though only a small amount of the sand to form an iron cork. This cork was placed on top og his gourd sealing off the hole at the very mouth of the gourd.* - Sun Nov  1 10:44:41 2015
