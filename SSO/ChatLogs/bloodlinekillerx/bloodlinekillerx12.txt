<br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) twidled his fingers nervously while next seated next to Madelyn, his eyes were focused towards his feet while Bryson called the bartender. The moment the bartended arrived he'd picked up his head as well. At the same exact moment the bartender glared at him, that was the exact moment both of their eyes laid on to each other. "That..glare." the teen grinded his teeth against each other, he knew that glare, the glare that the other villagers gave him from time to time..Though he hoped it'd have died down by now, especially since Sunagakure was under a new rule, he really did hope a new rule would bring a new change in more than one way.

"W-" before he could've even spoke his mind, Bryson defended him. He couldn't respect the man at this point, his eyes drifted away from him. A faint smile worn on his face, a smile that meant one thing to him. It meant he wouldn't have simple things such as this dampen his will, he'd progressed passed the rampages and deaths he'd caused, he'd taken full responsibility for it.

"I'll..I'll just take some water." his tone seemed to have died down a little from his previous upbeat self. His eyes were drawn at his hands that clutched tightly to his pants.* - Sun Oct 18 05:15:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: You know what I just realized?  - Sun Oct 18 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hm? - Sun Oct 18 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I can expell achohal from your sustem maybe? - Sun Oct 18 05:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) picked up his head after the bartender returned, in honesty he expected the man to return with the same manerism as before. But it seemed everything about him changed, did Bryson and Ai really scare him that badly? It made the teen smile a little, their drinks arrived in his case his tall glass of water. 

He hadn't even touched his water as yet, as the man left he'd picked up the bottle of water and brought it up to his nose. From there he'd begin to smell it for any strange scents, "*sniff sniff* It seems all right." to him it did check out. Though water didn't carry any different scents especially if someone spiked it, he wouldn't have known anyway. 

Tetsu raised his glass while saying, "Cheers?" a half wmile was seen on his face before downing some of the water, just half. The rest of it he'd place on the table."Alcohol? Ehh..Maybe a little sip.." he'd say while turning towards Ai, maybe just a sip wasn't -that- bad, thogh he was still skeptical about drinking the subtace."Well..If this is what friends do together." he hadn't actual friends in a while.

From Ai he'd turn to Madelyn, "Soo..How's the milk?" the teen questioned, though he agreed silently that she shouldn't have -any- of that liquid..It was best, especially since she'd have calmed down and her mental state seemed to be held in check for now.* - Sun Oct 18 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes shifted over to the Ai's cup that she pushed across the table infront of him."Mhmm." he'd stare at the glass for a second or two before reaching out for it. Once it was in his grasp he'd eye down the subtance, he didn't need to smell the drink he could smell the liquor from his position. "Better than never..right.." the teen thought as she sipped from the glass, though he'd drink a little bit than bargained. Not enough to get him drunk, maybe losen him up a bit, but not drunk he still retained his senses..Passing out from drinking to much wasn't an option, he knew how people got when they couldn't handle their liquor.

"Ack! Bitter." the teen realized after processing the taste of it, he'd slid the glass back down to Ai. The taste..the bitter taste lingered on his tongue, he had to wash it down. Instinctively he'd grapped the remainder of his glass of water, he'd brought it up to his lips drinking the entire thing. Hopefully this'll also dilute it from his system, something he'd learned from Kisara's many hangover episodes in the kazekage mansion in the past, god bless her soul.* - Sun Oct 18 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shook his head as he waved at the man before he left."Guess its me and your for now Ai." though judging from the taint of red that her cheeks had taken on. "Mhmm. Guess we should get moving soon?" the teen questioned, he'd get up from his seat. A wonderful surpise and sensation swepted over him, his body felt..wavy, light in a way. Though he had control of his body, he just felt..at ease, comfortable."Is this how they feel?" the teen thought, he'd look off into the distance.* - Sun Oct 18 07:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) noticed his sister take a seat next to him, he'd extend a hand outward and ruffled her hair playfully. Once done, he'd close his eyes meditating.* - Sun Oct 18 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's going to be a difficult thing to achieve, but I believe it's possible. - Sun Oct 18 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There are alot of evil people....The world is based around fighting and killing. I mean, as much as I want peace, I've killed and even vowed to kill certain men. Is it evil to kill?---In your opinion? - Sun Oct 18 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't believe in murder. All lives are valuable. I understand that people feel the need that they must kill, but my journey is to change the way people think. Too many people view themselves as tools, which is a reason why we fight for our lives. - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is murdering and killing the same thing? - Sun Oct 18 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So to answer your question, I don't believe it to be 'evil' as evil is a relative word. There's no good or evil, just those with an open mind and those who refuse to think in a new way. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Taking the life of an individual is all the same. I've yet to take a life, and I hope that I don't have to. I've been told that such a day will happen, but I really wish one won't arise. - Sun Oct 18 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can't agree with you there. We both are looking for peace in the world though...I don't see it happening without certain people dying. - Sun Oct 18 07:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am willing to die in order to achieve peace..But I'm not here to die  without a fight. You will find a man one day that cannot be changed, and is destined to be killed or continue killing. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You will realize at that point, this world can't be so innocent....It will never be so innocent. - Sun Oct 18 07:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, we take two paths towards the same goal. Maybe we will achieve it together, through different means. There are many ways to take down a beast. - Sun Oct 18 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps.. - Sun Oct 18 07:42:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: When good men do not die needlessly... - Sun Oct 18 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess mine is from personal experiences. But my brother was murdered in cold blood and so was my closest friend. - Sun Oct 18 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And those men who killed him are the men I have vowed to kill. They are everyting that is wrong with the ninja world. We have a few like that in the village and I wish to change them for the better...From my experience, it's more probable that I'll have to kill them. - Sun Oct 18 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. So your 'peace' is one where your loved ones don't die through the actions of other men? - Sun Oct 18 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I guess if you want to put it that way. I don't like to see people suffer and I do not like antagonism. When I see it, I want to kill it. If you let it grow, it becomes harder to kill...Kind of sick but it's true. - Sun Oct 18 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ah, a path of revenge..Revenge is akin to a flame. It burns anything and everything around you. However, lif used and directed properly, the flame can have pupose. - Sun Oct 18 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And I do have purpose. - Sun Oct 18 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm sure you do, but it's the flame of revenge that should be directed to a positive outlook.  - Sun Oct 18 07:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: This is the only outlook I see. It's what I've lived. - Sun Oct 18 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You'll see others eventually.  My only advice to you about revenge is, don't let it swallow you up. - Sun Oct 18 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, it almost did.... - Sun Oct 18 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But I work towards the betterment of my village now. If I ever get to take my revenge upon those men, I will..But I have a job here and I can't throw it away to fight battles. - Sun Oct 18 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. I suppose if I was brought up with a different point of view, I may have been the same.  To me, my ideal sense of peace is unity.  A world where everyone has reached a geniuine understanding of one and another, and are able to solve things through words and words a lone.  If I can even get an individual to see the world through such lens, it would make me happy. - Sun Oct 18 07:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) body became tense a little after hearing Madelyn's voice, his cheeks became a little pink in a color, at least no one would be able to see it. Though this wouldn't be true as Ai appeared infront of him utilizing the body flicker technique."AHHH!" was heard from the teen noticing Ai, "Mhmm? I probably can't stay, Hassan summoned me elsewhere." it was a drag, but his jounin duties came first sadly.* - Sun Oct 18 21:52:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) after leaving the three, he'd enter the building where he'd been summoned to.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) remained quiet, his eyes went from either Hassan or Asteroth as they spoke. To him the deal seemed fair, if he had his way he wouldn't help Asteroth gain more money. It wasn't her, it was Amegakure. He held a bitter grudge against the village, the village that also caused him pain in the past and held Amu captive for some time. But maybe..maybe if they agreed to something on equal terms, then that's when all the great villagers, and people within the world of shinobi could truely attain peace. "..Mhmm.. Still..It doesn't seem right, what she's asking." the teen thought, while drumming his leg against the floor board of the office.

"Even if she speaks..peace. People usually discard that peace to better themselves." at least, he wasn't in charge. It probably might've went a lot..wayward. All of these words were thoughts he discussed with himself in his mind.* - Sun Oct 18 23:02:49 2015

Refocusing from Madelyn back to Hideki he'd speak, his tone changing from its previous tone of concern to a darker much causious tone."Your action just now..Why..In the hell, would I trust you, you tried to hit with me a rock?" that action might'nt have been the wisest thing to do at the teen. Some of the villagers still hated his guts for his past, he wouldn't have a choice but the believe Hideki shared this view and either wanted to lead the Jounin into a trap or his death.* - Mon Oct 19 01:02:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was lost in the swirl of the tomoe's of the reddish eyes Hideki possessed. His will was at Hideki's fingertips, his mind wondered elsewhere, his body wasn't at his control any longer, "Dinner..Maybe it isn't that bad..He just wants to.." he'd begin to walk towards Hideki, his intent to follow behind of him.

//Shukaku voice boomed through out Tetsumi's mind, such a harsh anoying voice, "KID, GET THE FUCK UP! BEFORE I TAKE OVER!" the fear of that alone, thus the chakra the beast supplied him with, it rejuvenated the teen, clearing his senses. His vision cleared up, Hideki was infront of him once again."What?.." the teen thought, he'd back away from him trying to revert his own eyes from Hideki to his chest level."Was..that genjutsu?" the teen questioned in his mind, his anger welled up inside of the teen, his body shook a little.

The sand swirled around the teen violently, more of the sand poured out from his gourd. He could've attacked, but..How much did everyone in the general area knew what was going on..He'd heard Sanoke's voice from the left of him, he tried to assure him. Instead of attacking or following behind of Hideki to speak in private he'd attempt to turn around and walk away.

One portion of sand formed into ten shuriken aiming to implae the snakes hopefully killing or rendering their grasp on him.

(Extra Turn) Once this was done, another portion of the sand formed into a giant hand formed from the blackened sand, this hand raced towards Hideki's chest aiming to slam into him either in hopes of pushing him away from him."That's Seto's technique, damn snakes."* - Mon Oct 19 02:06:17 2015

It supported him allowing him to levitate in the sky above, the platform began to acend higher trying to get away from Hideki. He truely didn't want to start a fight here, he honestly wanted for Hideki to move prompting him to release his snakes and divert his attention elsewhere for his potential escape.

If this was successful, all of the iron sand utilized in the fist, the shuriken, and the previous platform reverted back into iron sand. Once reverted back into blackend grain, it'd flow back into his gourd, unless something hindred this. If it did, he'd leave reguardless, he could've restocked on the sand at a later date.* - Mon Oct 19 02:21:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Though...I'd probably go to my default location within the village. - Mon Oct 19 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: That's my boy.~ - Mon Oct 19 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Better not fuck up. - Mon Oct 19 20:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) body was tense he'd taken a deep breath exhaling a bit. He'd open his closed hand, this worked as a trigger to slacken the iron cork on his gourd, as well as removing it. Once removed it fell to the sand below, reverting back into iron sand. More of the blackened sand flowed out of his gourd, a steady flow of the material gathered below his as well as Madelyn's feet forming a single platform for the two.

On the outside he didn't show as much emotion, but on the inside he was smiling he felt happy, excited for a change. The platform levitated from the sands below before embarking towards the sky above, its direction headed towards the west of the village.* - Mon Oct 19 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Jiki, I know you can read my mind, fuck up and I'll stick my foot up that booty. - Mon Oct 19 20:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) single platform of iron sand landed a top of a house, the house seemed to be inhabited by someone else enterily different, indicating it most likely wasn't his house. Once they landed the platform of iron deconstructed turning back into iron sand and flowing right back into his gourd, it was only him and Madelyn at this height."Well.." he'd rub his hand behind of his head nervously, "This is one of..One of my meditation spots, its a precious memory." his voice was nervous at first, but balanced itself out after he'd built some confidence deepw within.

"First..you uhh." he couldn't continue as yet, he looked at the sky reflecting on the turtle hermit Sanoke's teaching he bestowed on him, though it became a bit foggy in his mind standing next to Madelyn.* - Mon Oct 19 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) diverted his attention from the sky above, he refocused his attention back on to Madelyn mainly because she playfully nudged him with her elbow. The teen laughed while saying playfully, "Stop it!" he'd returned the playfull elbow nudges. It was strange, he didn't feel threatened..his sand didn't even appear to protect him..."What..What is this feeling?" the teen questioned himself in his mind, he did see Madelyn in a completely different light than everyone else. Her personality, it just made him want to reach out to help..that personality reminded him of himself to much, well while the lack of sleep, hate from the villagers, and attacks by them triggered that side of him.

"No..Not really. Though, this place is special. I guess that's why I brought you here." he'd paused while looking at the house below his feet."Its where I lived, before my family were killed. It holds precious memories, memories that I sometimes try to escape from, but it doesn't bother me as much..while I'm with you." he'd brought his hand up to his mouth, as if trying to stop himself from continue speaking, he said too much..His heart was pouring out, it longed for someone, someone that he could disclose his suffering, his emotions with.* - Mon Oct 19 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: H-Have to calm myself down..M-Mediation will clear my mind. - Mon Oct 19 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) cheeks burned a hotter, turning from the pink hue they'd taken on to a fiery red as Madelyn got closer to him. His heart was racing, he couldn't react he heard her words, he'd heard them before. No human, nore someone like himself should go through that much pain, should burden it all alone. It wasn't fair for her to be alone, hurting like this. Before he could've said anything else, she'd wrap him up in her arms, he'd gotten this close. He felt her heart beat, it was as intense as his own, they beats beated together in unison. His body moved on its own at this point, he'd gotten closer whispering something in her air before proceeding from there."I don't think you're crazy, if so...I've fallen for a crazy girl like you."

his words were left there for Madelyn to register this, he'd motion towards her forehead pressing his lips against it kissing it. He'd hold her close, staring into her eyes, a smile forming on his lips as he held Madelyn in his arms.* - Mon Oct 19 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widned noticing Madelyn leaning in for a kiss, as like Madelyn it was his first kiss as well. He lacked skill in this department, though he hoped he made it special for her. Both of their lips touched, his eyes shut as well. For him there were sparks, not visible ones but sparks fireing about through out his being, he rewarped his arms around Madelyn, it was tight, probably even tighter than Madelyn's previous grip on him.

In that moment, he forgot about everything, he only cared for Madelyn's presence. The village, the demon within, none of it was important, not as long as he stayed like this, with Madelyn.* - Mon Oct 19 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) held Madelyn close, while returning the whisper while kissing the side of her neck."I won't." his words were sencere, though he wanted to say something else. It was emotions that flowed back into him the moment the kissing ceased, "W-Would she really fall for a monster like me? Especially if she knew the truth?" he didn't know, though he wouldn't tell her as yet, maybe later in the future. 

He'd speak up again, his tone soft "I won't leave you, you're my girl now afterall, right?" the teen said playfully, never once escaping the embrace of Madelyn or ceasing eye contact with her.* - Mon Oct 19 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: Yes, haha. I am your girl! And you are my, boyfriend. Mhm.~ - Mon Oct 19 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: Tetsumi, can I ask you something? - Mon Oct 19 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm? Sure...What is it? - Mon Oct 19 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) whispers: Why are... most people afraid of me? - Mon Oct 19 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) whispers: Because, I tend to walk around... and mostly point at me and call me crazy girl. - Mon Oct 19 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: Well..People tend to do things like that either out of fear, or misunderstanding the situation. - Mon Oct 19 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: Its human nature after all. - Mon Oct 19 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: Mmm.... I ...just want to fit in. I don't want to be known as crazy girl. - Mon Oct 19 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Better than monster. - Mon Oct 19 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Just prove em' wrong. One of my friends once told me."Only you can decide your own path" Even today, I cherish those words. - Mon Oct 19 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: It helped me with a lot of challenges, especially when I too...lost my mind. - Mon Oct 19 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: So..basically, just change it for yourself. Change what they think of you. - Mon Oct 19 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Even if it doesn't, or all think bad of you. I'm here for you. And it'll never change. - Mon Oct 19 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: Alright, heh.  - Mon Oct 19 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: I'm glad you are by my side. - Mon Oct 19 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) allowed his hand to be grabed, his finger to interwinned with Madelyn's fingers. He'd look into her eyes, a bright smile worn on his face. From her he'd look at the sky once more, "No matter what, what ever people say. I'll always love you ya'know." * - Mon Oct 19 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Ehehe." his signature laughed escaped him, he'd turn towards Madelyn."S-Should I?.." he was fighting between the urge to tell her or not. The urge of tellign her about it.."No..She'll probably hate me, it'd suck if I killed some of her family when I lost control in the past. Mhmm.." the teen thought, though his face seemed lost for a moment before the same old goofy smile returned.* - Mon Oct 19 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: But Jiki...what about us?... - Mon Oct 19 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: -omit- - Mon Oct 19 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: You said...You love------*walks away* You'll never see your son! *leaves to Ame* - Mon Oct 19 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: -omit- - Mon Oct 19 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) decided he'd sit, just for everything to soak in. His eyes looked saddened, he was worried for Madelyn."I see..I don't look at you differently for your actions, i've een what you really are beyond all of this. If you have the tendency..the urge coming on to hurt someone else, divert this feeling for me. I'll take the pain, though..I hope my love for your subtitutes itself for the pain you'd have to inflict on yourself to calm down."

There was a pause in his speech, "I too..in the past, I killed many people..They hated me, so I thought it'd be right. Right to show them the same pain I felt, through death. But.. People I met along the way changed me, i-in truth..I'm someone most people with be weary around, they away from." he'd squeeze tighter while holding Madelyn's as he spoke.* - Mon Oct 19 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) leaned in to kiss Madelyn once more, his lips conforting the female, he'd pull away. His whole demeanor changed a bit, "I-..In a way yes. But..If I showed you something, would you be afraid or not?" the teen questioned Madelyn, he wanted to see her experession on this, "If..you saw something completely different about me..Something.." he wouldn't continue his sentence, his eyes looked deeply into Madelyn as if he was close to tears even.* - Mon Oct 19 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: I promise, I won't be afraid. What do you want to show me? - Mon Oct 19 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: --- - Mon Oct 19 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: Is it a spider? - Mon Oct 19 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "A spider? No-No.." Just..Just promise it won't change your view on me." with that said, iron sand flowed out of his gourd forming a single platform of iron sand below both of their feet. The sand became dense to support their weight before it soared once mor whisking the couple away, this time out of the village."I can't show this..this side of me within the village. The villagers have a bitter grudge against me." in truth, they had a bitter grudge against the beast within, but this hate was transfered to him as well.

The platform soared through the sky, it wasn't as fast but fast enough to traverse towards the ideal location. A location came into view, it was a rocky terrain in the dessert, a large mountain towered in the distance."There. That's my other meditating spot, its the ideal spot." this location not even Sanoke knew about it, or anyone else at that. The platform landed once the two arrived a top of the mountain, though it didn't flow back into his gourd or deconstruct back into sand it remained the same retaining its shape and density.

"Mhmm..Here I go." was heard from the teen, he'd clasped his hands focusing. If one looked closer at the mountain, it was a peaceful location, if one looked beyond this they'd see sand for days but it was a peaceful location, small critters of the dessert frolicked about if one dared to take yet again a closer look. Though this was all disrupted, he'd borrow a portion of the beast's chakra. 

A cold sensation filled the air, it was raw power, chakra and a bit of suppressed killing intent emitting from the teen's body. Iron sand materialized out of thin air, it layed itself a top of the teen's body covering half of his body. That half looked monstrous, he continued the process, more of the iron sand layered itself a top of his body. It spread across it like a rash, a tail that was a replica of the beast's tail formed, the sand continued giving him a right monstrous arm to match the left. His entire body was coated in massive demonic chakra, he'd open his eyes, his pupils as well changed to mimic the beat's own. In all, he looked like a miniature version of the giant tanuki that rabaged Sunagkure in the past, as well as destroyed Konoha as of late. "This..is the true me." the teen spoke, his voice too changed, it seemed rouge. His tail swayed from left to right, his peered into Madelyn's eyes, though he expected the love they shared to come to an end after this action.* - Mon Oct 19 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was shocked by this, taken by surprise even. Through all this, despite him showing a portion of what's inside of him..Her convictions stayed firm and true, her love for him didn't even weaver."Y-You..." his voice was a bit rougue brough on byt he transformation, he'd hold the teen tigher both of his massive monstrous arms holding her ever so closely, his tail swayed from side to side. He truely felt happy, the iron sand from his body fell off, it simply fell to the ground, inhabiting the mountain's earth, his eyes returned to normal, his physical appearance returned to how it was as well.

He'd lean in closer, attempting to steal a kiss once more. After the kiss, he'd pull away while whispering."No..well..At first, but you proved me wrong. Thank You, for being here for me Madelyn." she was different, she really embraced him for whom he really was, and to think he might've killed her and left her out here to rot if she babbled about this occurance.* - Mon Oct 19 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Though, please..Don't tell anyone else. - Mon Oct 19 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: The villagers hates me. - Mon Oct 19 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: If more people knew..knew of me, I'd probably be targeted and killed. - Mon Oct 19 23:31:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) he'd lead Madelyn back on to the platform, once both of them were a board it it'd rise into the air headed back towards the village.* - Mon Oct 19 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: I love you too, hehe.~ - Mon Oct 19 23:33:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) platform of iron sand landed from above, right infront of the benches that stod behind of the two. The iron sand, flowed right back into his gourd, a cork formed out of the material it was placed at the top of his gourd sealing it off from potential spills.* - Mon Oct 19 23:38:14 2015
