<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) slowly turned on his heels attempted to leave the area, at this time he'd heard Susumu's voice pipe of from somewhere behind him, probably in the arena somewhere."Ehh..Maybe another time, I have.. a different type of training I must do alone in peace, ya'know." with that, he'd attempt to leave the area for good unless he'd been stopped again or something.* - Fri Oct 16 03:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stopped once more in his attempt to leave, something yet again prevented him from truely escaping. His eyes focused on where the caughing was emitting from, "Mhmm? How are you?" the teen asked Mokutsu, it was obvious he was probably in a rush leaving the general area.* - Fri Oct 16 03:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) followed behind of him, not once did his guard drop nore ease up for a second. It wasn't that he didn't trust me, its just past experiences similar to this were failed attempts to claim his life. Hopefully it was just a cruious Mokutsu about whatever question plagued his mind. He'd try to take more notes of his figure, trying to see if the reminder he left Mokutsu with were still visible. Key things to see if this was really Mokutsu or a transformation.* - Fri Oct 16 03:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) once arriving at his place of meditation side to side with Mokutsu he'd channel chakra to his feet. This quick burst of chakra helped in conjuction with his next chain of movement he'd have jumped..Jumped right on to the boulder before the two. Once on top of it, he'd sit down motioning into a meditative stance, though both of his hands were placed in his laps, both of his eyes trained on Mokutsu's figure."Now, descripe..this voice or figure again. Though, in a hushed tone, don't want anyone ease dropping and think you're crazy."* - Fri Oct 16 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) whispers: Ever since I can remember, I've had this voice in my head. It only used to speak up once a year MAYBE. Now...It's everyday. It's giving my advice, or telling me about some earlier memory I had...I don't know. It calls it's self Son Goku. Which is strange. I had never heard that name...So how did I suddenly imagine it?

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: You may make the first move. I'll cover you. - Fri Oct 16 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I've got your back..." the teen thought, while Saeza darted forward at hassan different outcomes of this tactic success or failures to this played out in his mind. He probbaly had a seventy percent chance of success, but who knew maybe his lousy luck would play out in his favour.

"I'm Tetsu." as he spoke the iron cork from his gourd was forced away forcibly knocking it into the air. A blackened sand, iron sand erupted from his gourd. The sand plit off into two sections, one half focused on protecting Saeza if need be, while the other hald of sand continued to spread along the battlefield. It continued to flow from the teen's gourd, maybe if he did this it'd be a lot..easier on them, unless Ziare started flying. Then it'd become hectic.* - Fri Oct 16 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: It may be the best move to take me out first. Mhmm. What will you decide, gramps. - Fri Oct 16 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm.." the teen observed the female's movement. A large amount of sand continued to flow from his gourd, it broke off into two sections once more. One section of his sand was focused on changing the terrain by making his sand inhabit the natural sand from below. This way he'd be able to assist Saeza better, as well as force Hassan into flying or be captured in the process.

A portion of the sand before remained on stand by, hoping to protect Saeza if she was attacked again. Especially since she was so close to Hassan, he knew from past experienes how agile the man truely was. The shield of iron sand would counteract if the need be. If it came to that, a dense sheild would form, protecting her from infront, if the attack was more wide ranged, he'd probably be forced to protect her from all sides.* - Fri Oct 16 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "B-Bats..?" the teen stammered in his mind, from his position it looked as if she'd try to get a hold of him while he was mid-air, that would work out for him. It just would take a little longer. Another large portion, though more focused continued to spread across the arena's battlefield finally covering the battlefield with his own type of sand. 

Though, he wouldn't double team hassan this turn. He needed his sand to inhabit the sand below incase Saeza's attack was a success. Though, if she was caught mid-air in a trap by the geezer, it probably would've ended sour for his teamate.* - Fri Oct 16 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We're done. - Fri Oct 16 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Damnit...I failed. No. I can still take on Hassan, while I protect her..She's in my grasp now after all." even though his teamate might've been out of commission, he prodicted this to an extent. "Old man, prepare yourself!" as he spoke he brought both hands up to the mid-section of his body. 

He'd clapped his hands, this worked as a trigger for a large mass of iron sand to be expelled from his gourd. It raced skyward, it broke off into several sections, not one focused attack. It was spread off yes, making it a bit smaller than before, but it'd work to block off Hassan path from above working in a way that the only way out of this was to soar higher, or bum rush through his sand. Or he coud've used one of his strong wind typed jutsu, these were all plausable outcomes. 

(Strategem Perk.) While a portion of the sand blocked off his path, he'd have been churning chakra. Another large mass of blackened grain was forced out from his gourd, this expelled amount of it molded forming into a large hand that raced forward attempting to grab Hassan by his feet or chest region. Though his wind armor was the real threat here, since it'd probably ate away at his sand arm if it landed in the first place at all.* - Fri Oct 16 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I may have to increase my supply of sand soon..mhmm..How troublesome. - Fri Oct 16 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Nice..He made himself faster than my sand. Mhmm..Maybe this'll work, if I can't catch him with my sand. If I take flight, chase after Hassan..I'll be more vulnerable above..Great. He's so fast, I'll have to resort to that method." thought while manipulating the large amount of sand above, all of it was shaped differently. Shaped into droplets, it was small, but mixed in with the cluster of iron sand above maybe a good amount of it would make contact with Hassan's body.

The droplets of iron sand fell from the sky like blackened droplets of rain, raining down on the area around Tetsumi. With this method, hopefully some of the droplets would touch him -if- he attempted to go right for him. Maybe...Just maybe he could slow down his movements hopefully.* - Fri Oct 16 22:29:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked up above anyway, he had to since he tried to track Hassan's movement through his speed and the rain of iron sand that rained from above inhabiting the area around his person.* - Fri Oct 16 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked up above anyway, he had to since he tried to track Hassan's movement through his speed and the rain of iron sand that rained from above inhabiting the area around his person. The rain would come to an end, he'd look take a clearer look at Hassan's robotic red eye, "Heh, sacrifice huh." a smile was etched on his face, though he wondered how Hassan even recieved such a scar.

"Mhmm.." he'd stop for now, further examining his position in the fight and different ways how he'd even catch up with Hassan and his immense speed. He was stumped for the time being.* - Fri Oct 16 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "M-My body..why is it so heavy.." didn't understand this, even if he tried to manipulate sand in Hassan's direction it'd be blown away, what would he do? At least he knew Hassan was focused on one area, and that was for a frontal assault on him, well from his position it'd be to his side.. On its own, iron sand materialized out of thin air. It a dense shield of iron sand was formed where Hassan hoped to attack. 

While this happened the teen tried to form hands out of iron sand, hoping to clutch on to Hassan's feet either stopping, which mostlikely wasn't possibly. Or slowing down his approach.* - Fri Oct 16 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) hadn't the choice, since his defenses were compromised he'd resort to his last defense. More iron sand materialized, utilzing this conjured sand it lattered itself along Tetsumi's entire body hoping to soften the blow. He had to just hold on, though this would be difficult with Hassan as his opponent.* - Fri Oct 16 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Damnit!" was struck by Hassan's attack, his eyes flew open as his armor of sand was penetrated, his fleash was vulnerable, hassan's attack continued eventually piercing his fleash and dealing the desired amount of dammage..He couldn't do much about, he even by passed his sand shield's speed. The sand even tried and tried to defend but, it was blown away and pierced through just like the last time. A crimson liquid leeked from the wound or wounds he'd sustained, the teen dropped on to one knee due to the heavyness Hassan's genjutsu induced on him.* - Fri Oct 16 23:17:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) laid back while the medics worked on him, he heard Hassan's words but they were distant to him. The wounds were just fleash wounds after all, but he was elsewhere."I could've beaten him..only if I.." another voice boom in his mind, it made its presence known to only Tetsumi.  Back in reality Tetsu remained quiet, staring at the ceiling or sky (depending on where he was taking to be healed up) a blank look on his face.

Shukaku's world came into focus, below his feet was a golden floor he could've even seen his own reflection in its gleam it gave off. His eyes were focused on the beast as it spoke, //Shukaku"Only if you used my power right?" the beast chuckled, "You could've, though it'd be yet again another opening for me. Heh, is that why you didn't use it? Because you're afraid or this, or is it because i'd hurt that geezer? It wouldn't matter anyway, the old coot has one foot in the grave as it is. I'd be helping him."

//Tetsumi stared faultered, it moved from the Tanuki's body on to his reflection that was reflected in the glass. The beast remained behind its ancient lettering that kept it from escaping for the time being. He'd reestablish eye contact with the beast, their was fear deep in his heart but it was dwindling greatly from his training, in exchange of his fear confidence formed.

//Tetsumi, "You know, i'm not afraid of you Shukaku. Though, I do fear what's left of that old man's life. He's done a lot for me, it wouldn't be fair to repay him in that way."//Shukaku"Wha?..You're getting way softer kid, geez. You're even more of a baby than before. *mimiced his voice* "He's done a lot for me, it wouldn't be right to repay him that way. And what exactly has he done for you? You humans are sure strange, idiots even, all of you vermin."

//Tetsumi laughed, "And..When were you concerned about me being weak or not Shukaku?" a bright smile was worn on his face, feeling a bit victorious this round.//Shukaku shook his head."I'm not concerned about you, i'm concerned about your body. It won't be fair possessing a weak vessel. Tch, either way. If I must, It'll have to make due. I'm Shukaku! I Have no limits!"

Tetsumi smiled hearing the tanuki's confidence, maybe he should take a page or two from the beast's on pride from him. "Mhmm. I see. Its sad for you though, this weakened vessel will triumph in the end." the teen stuck out his tongue playfully at the tanuki.

//Shukaku, blinked twice. Its voice exceeding its normal booming tone once more, sending shivers down Tetsumi's spine and wind based chakra about. //Tetsumi this truely startled him when shukaku got like this, but he kept that smile worn on his face. It was a sign of him winning or taunting him. Before his very eyes, the world of the beast broke deconstructed, the world was devoured in darkness prompting the teen to retake in the scene of his world again. The nurses continued to heal his wounds, patching him up or probably at this point leaving. Though he wasn't good with time while within shukaku's plain, time seemed to flow differently to him.* - Fri Oct 16 23:46:20 2015

His direction if he kept going at the speed that he traversed the skies, out of the village.* - Sat Oct 17 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) landed off into the distance, a little ways from his meditation location away from the village. The platform of sand once he landed broke apart, converting back into iron sand before it flowed back into his gourd. An iron cork was crafted afterwards, this sealed off the top of the gourd preventing sand from flowing in or out of it. 

He'd begin to advance towards his training boulder, a strong sandstorm kicked up, strong winds mixed in with sand pushed him back while the sand traveling at such speeds stung him a little. "Heh, this'll be piece of cake." this was apart of his training afterwall. Though it'd be much harder in his current state, his body ached, each step felt as if his soul was being pierced. His body quivered a little, he was pushed back but he wouldn't faulter. The pain would compensate for the aftermath of utilzing shukaku's chakra, he always was in pain afterwards for some reason.

The teen dug firm, his footing sinked into the sand as he kepted propeling hmself forward. He'd made it to the boulder, he'd lean up against it with his arms wide open. It looked as if he was hugging the rock, but he had to catch his breath, as well as register what he was trying to do in his mind. He'd channel chakra to his hands and feet.

Just looking at the distance between him and the top made his stomach some what unsettling."I can do this." after this word of confidense he'd begin to crawl using all fours to scale the rock. Each movement from each limb caused him pain, his body ached. At certain points he wanted to give in, have the pain he felt have its own way."C-Can't." he'd push forward, braching the wind that knocked his body from side to side. He'd arrived at the top, as he did his body flopped to the ground. Well the top of the massive boulder.

He laid there for a bit, rolling over he'd look up at the sky above. Everything else seemed hectic from below, but from here he saw more than the mayhem of nature. He also saw a kinder side to it, he reflected about life from this view. Life was much like the view he'd taken in, this was also the lesson. "I understand." it clicked into his mind, something he hadn't realized before.

"Mhmm..I'm wasting time either way, i've been away from the village a little too long." he head to remind himself about this, especially since he kind of overstayed his welcome while training. He'd fix himself into the improved meditative stance Sanoke showed him, his feet were crossed, his hands were clasped at the mid-section of his body, while his eyes were shut. He felt intuned with nature to an extent, from the wind, to the grain of sand that shifted below and that was carried by the wind. He heard and felt it all, his heart rate decreased from its added state of adrenaline, he wa calming himself down.

"Shukaku." the teen spoke in his mind while calling the tanuki's name, it was a change. Though it might've been better if he adressed the tanuki by its actual name verus One'O or Tanuki. If the beast felt anything about that, he understod to an extent, though he didn't know the beast's past before his time with him. While he called out his true name he tried to connect to his chakra.

//Shukaku questioned in a loud tone, it was as if his tone of voice was at one setting, loud. As he spoke his voice set off everything, his world itself came into focus, materializing before Tetsumi. The cursed ancient letters kept him binded, preventing escape. The floor remained golden, his hands were folded as he stared into the squirts eyes."What? Did you come to come to grant me permission of your body now? If not scram, you're annoying. You've been here far too long lately."

//Tetsumi beamed up at the bijuu, his insults didn't get to him as much anymore. Despite his words and nature itself, his pressence was much needed at times. He had to get familiar with that term 'Become friends with the monsters inside of your head'. then again, he looked at Shukaku as a rival."No...I'm not considering that Shukaku, wouldn't that be too easy? Wouldn't you want to break my will instead? That'd seem more fun for you. Anyway, are you sure we can't negociate something about me using your power?"

//Shukaku "Mhmm. No. Not with a human, especially you." //Tetsumi "C'mon Shukaku, you're afriad that i'll manage it eh? Is that why you can't simply come to some type of terms with me using your power?" //Shukaku"Do..you really think you can sway me with your words child?"//Tetsumi"No..Not really, to be honest. I'm just keeping you company."

//Shukaku"I don't need your company. I never even asked for it, you're a pest. A leech that keeps beggin' for power. Even if I did gave you power, you wouldn't be able to handle it. It really won't have anything in it for me, well besides some laughs."//Tetsumi"Ehh..How about this, if you're right. You can have my body? Wouldn't be easier for you? Ya'know if I lost control again?" seemed to be dealing with the situation open hearted, though was he pluffing or completely sencere.

//Shukaku a loud screech of happiness was heard from the beast."Oh? Would you really risk that child? Over a stupid gamble, words won't get you out of my grasp."//Tetsumi closed his eyes for a brief moment, he'd think about kastya and what she probably went through even trying to control her body."Yes, i'm willing. Though not right now. I have other things to attend to. I shall part for now Shukaku. The next time I return, that's when we'll face off. Your power shall no longer corrupt me."//Shukaku laughed, "Oh, aren't we confident. Though, I'd rather seize my prize of your mind, body, and soul right now!" he tried to extend his hand outward but the letter of his prison prevented this.."Fuckin..Arugghh..You win this time..soon..soon..i'll take control of your body, the same way how I prevent you from sleep."

The teen sighed, the beast's eyes closed. The world around him faded away, the yellow gleam of the beast's eyes piercing through him. It was etched in his mind, he'd already dug himself this far in his own mess. It was best he followed through with it, especially if it'd be his end."Heh, the worse that could happen, he'll just have control of my body.." he spoke as if that wasn't all nore a major thing, it made him wish he was doing his training around or near to konoha so he wouldn't feel any sympathy for the lives Shukaku would take."I'll need Sanoke's help..his help before the next step." the teen realized after begining his decent from the boulder and his adventure back to the village.
* - Sat Oct 17 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) couldn't find the turtle hermit Sanoke for miles around."Did he neglect me training?" the teen questioned, every attempt to locate him ended in failure. Why had it been so hard to find one turtle shell wearing shinobi? It couldn't be helped, he had to continue with his training reguardless. "I guess it was meant for me alone at this point." with this thought he'd leave the village once more.

As he ventured out, this time he wouldn't go towards his normal training location nore even around sunagakure. He had to prepare for the worst, he'd be some ways away where there weren't any signs of civilization. "This..will be far enough." he'd taken in the scene that painted a vivid picture before his eyes. It was just..sand for miles, though there was a water source near by. Maybe this is where sunagakure got their water from in the past.

He'd sit before the water source, his reflection staring back at him. The reflection itself didn't look confident nore sure in himself, was he really like this at the moment of truth? He'd release a sigh from within, "Can give up, I promised Shukaku. I won't give in, while my will is intact..He won't be able to win!" these were words to motivate him, give him some hope and confidence, though all he had were butterflies in his stomach.

He'd fix his feet into a meditative stance, the same exact stance Sanoke took while teaching him his improved stance. His hands motioned towards the mid-section of his body, he'd brought both of them together. His eyes closed off, shutting out the world around him, the reflection in the water slowly dimenishing away from his sight. "Peace..I shall accomplish this with your help." these were the lost thoughts he had on his mind before his mind went blank for a moment. 

He'd connect to the beast's chakra, this time he invited himself into the beast's world. The world materialized appearing and showing itself off before Tetsumi's vey eyes. The world looked the same, but it felt different..a chill was felt in the air, to his very breath was chilled. It was pure terror, killing intent giving off by the tanuki. In its cage of ancient letter Shukaku waited, a confident look on its face. 

//Tetsumi looked up at the giant, his words calm as he spoke"I'm ready Shukaku.//Shukaku"Oh?! Giving up already? GREAT, YOU'VE CAME TO YOUR SENSES!" //Tetsumi shook his head from side to side, his hands slowly extended outward."No. I'm ready to take on your power!" a confident grin was worn on his face, his heart was into it this time despite staring up at the beast.

//Shukaku's voice boomed through out his prison, "OH?! Heh, I hope you are, human!"as the beast spoke, the air itself felt thick..As if if it was hard to breath, its words becoming fierce with each sylable. Its chakra seeped through its prison, no. Not a little quantity as in the past, but a larger condensed amount of it.

//Tetsumi backed up a little, his once extended open arms slowly moving to his side. He'd done it this time, this'd probably be his end..Controlled by a god damn giant tanuki, how awful was that as an ending to his shinobi journey. Its chakra wrapped tight against his body, it felt as if it was squeezing, crushing him in the process and preventing the ability to take in oxygen.

//Tetsumi couldn't breath, the world around him spun. This situation..it reminded him of that day...the day everything flipped uptside down for him. It was the day he unknowningly came in contact with shukaku. The world around him was being consumed with darkness, it was just like this..Just like this when he and Shukaku met, maybe through the sand, his own sand that tried to kill..was when the beast was binded to him, trapped. 

//Shukaku's voice boomed, "WORTHLESS!" //Tetsumi, a voice other than shukaku ran through his mind. It was faint, but he knew who it was. The voice was his own voice, but it was once the hatred in his heart."You can't be giving up so easily, you managed to convince me of your path. Push on, rise above this, change this stupid tanuki's thoughts about you..The same way you changed me." the voice faded away, it probably tried to tell him something else but it was faint, words he couldn't comprehend.

//Shukaku wrapped the chakra around Tetsumi, it would force its way into his body morphing with the child's chakra. His had to break his potential vessel and unlock the pathway to his freedom!"He's almost mine, I'll be free. Heh, i'll destroy that village of his as thanks for his services." the beast thought, excitement ran through his entire sandy being.

//Tetsumi was force fed the chakra. The raw amount of chakra the tanuki forced on him had him in a comatose state, he wasn't aware of the things around him. Was..his life coming to an end? Was he actually going to lose against the beast? The world around him regained color. A bright light blinded him, a girl probably around fifteen years old, gray hair smiled at him."You're here. M-Mother.." the child stammered, he couldn't belive his very eyes. Was it really her? Was she here to take him away from this maddness? The maddness of life and the cruel people within it!

//Tetsumi ran up to her hugging the woman, it felt real..It didn't feel like a dream. //Kastya replied to him while embracing her adoptive son, son neither the less."You aren't ready to come here as yet. You aren't finished with what ever you're supposed to do. Though, we'll all be waiting for you hun." as she spoke other spirits appeared, numerous shinobi including his real parents, his grandfather, grandmother, friends..He wanted to stay and forget about this silly goal of him trying to tame shukaku's power.

Outside of where Tetsumi's mind was, his physical body began taking dammage. In the real world, the world of the living. His chakra swirled viciously, a strong lust for blood emitted from the teen that meditated in peace. No form of trasformation took place as yet, though it was the calm before the storm and something big was about to happen.

//Kastya released him and looked into his eyes, "You aren't finished. We can't wait to have you here, but its not your time. She'd look off into the distance."And you'd better deal with that, i'd be very upset with you, if you'd given up so easily.//Tetsumi was suprised at her response, "W-Wahh but..I'd rather be here with you guys, m-" she'd cut him off, "I love you hun." with that she'd punched him in his gut, he felt himself losing concious, the afterlife warped out of existance for him. Tear drop drops flew through the air, from his emotions of the ordeal and pure pressure from the punch and air that got into his eyes.

//Tetsumi stod face to face with himself, well his hatred though it looked more human than the last time he'd seen it."I told you, don't give up so easily. If you do, you'll lose, he'll win, and you'll die. Dying so early will dissapoint the dead, you'd be an outcase even in death. You can do this Tetsumi. Else, you'll have to face me this time and you'll know real hatred." the Tetsumi before himself playfully punched his arm before it erupted into multiple shards of light, all of it flowed back into him."Thank You."

//Tetsumi slowly opened his eyes, his stomach ached..It felt as if something was trying to escape from it..What was left of the beast's chakra forced its way past the barier of letters."Damnit." the teen cursed seeing the giant tanuki before him. //Shukaku, "Oh, someone is awake. Its too late. You've chosen the wrong time to nap!" its voice boomed, its hand extended forward attempting to squish the child against the golden floor, hell even smeer his body against it even.

//Tetsumi felt a burst of adrenaline, he wasn't going to die. He'd win, he wasn't sure how bue he'd accomplish this feat. The teen backflipped avoiding the incoming arm of sand, though that was only a trick. The sand from the hand continued to spread along the golden floor towards his feet. Reacting quickly the iron cork on his gourd was forcibly removed as a large amount of iron sand erupted from the gourd manipulated the by the teen.

//Tetsumi manipulated a portion of the iron sand to form a platform of iron for him. The platfom of iron sand became dense, supporting his weight before it flew above. "Mhmm..If I got into contact with its body, i'm done for." its hands, maybe if he..got rid of them it wouldn't be able to manipulate the sand. It was a gamble but he'd try it. A large amount of iron sand gathered above the Tanuki, the child flew about trying to keep the beast's sand away from him as well as distracting him while he prepared the technique. 

//Shukaku patience grew thin, "You fucking human, DIE ALREADY!" his voice boomed at a high pitched tone, as he did this it'd form a sindle seal. He kneaded the chakra together in his stomach, his belly grew as he tapped into the wind natured chakra within. His cheeks enlarged before expelling a powerful wind based attack in Tetsumi's direction, it was a wide spread attack and it would hopefully knock him away or trap him in the air as he tried to resist the force of the wind.

//Tetsumi did as the beast expected, a iron sand washed over him, it'd become dense forming a frontal shield to brace the wind based attack. It would work as a wind breaker of sorts, though it soon would fail, there were obvious nicks and knacks forming in the shield chipping away at the shield of sand he formed. "It won't cut it, damnit. I-"

//Shukaku attacked utilzing its tail, he didn't even gave the squirt enough room to think. He was a beast, while Tetsumi was a human..He wouldn't win. While the teen battled against the force of his wind, his tail swung about, it was aimed towards the shield shattering it in the process while also sending the key to his fredom flying."Now, to retrieve him."

//Tetsumi was forcibly knoced backwards by the beast's tail, to avoid most of the dammage despite the shield taking some with it, he'd have to fall back to his armor of sand. This softened to blow, but it still hurt..a lot.He'd be left groaning, it felt as if his chest at caved in from the attack, he'd spat up blood. The crimson liquid ran from the side of his mouth, "I won't give up, this..is true sacrifice." he quoted Hassan's words as he formed the iron sand gathered above the Tanuki into giant saw blades that began sawing through his hands, maybe he'd be successful in this attempt, but it was difficult.

//Shukaku continued to manipulate sand towardsTetsumi's figure. He had to reclaim him, especially since he couldn't move as much. Though his attempt to reclaim him with this method ended in failure, his arms were sawed off. It fell to the ground, converting back to sand. He howled in pain, "MY ARMSS!!! YOU FUCKING...I'M GONNA KILL YOU! I'M GOING TO GRIND YOUR VERY BONES INTO SAND!" its voice boomed, with the force of a madman. Despite this, he'd try to regenerate his hands.

In the physical world outside of Tetsumi mind where he fought Shukaku, the posesstion had already begun. Half of his body was covered in iron sand, it was a monstrous sight, the left side of his body resembled the beast within. Though he remained in a meditative stance, birds flew about fleeing in various directions due to the fright, pure terror, evil presence coming from the teen. The iron sand continued to spread, slowly but surely, a tail even formed, one that resembled the beast as much as half of the transformation thus far.

//Tetsumi worked quickly, he knew the beast was trying to regenerate its hands, something that would take a bit. But with what he had planned, the beast would beat him to it. It was difficult, if it wasn't for his will to survive, to win, he'd have given up. But there had to be an alternative to his grim possible faith. He'd clasped his hands gathering chakra, he needed to concentrate while he made his own iron sand for his technique.

//Shukaku cursed, his hands slowly regenerating. A stump of what used to be his very arms were visible. It clustered, pilling on to each other as it grew continuing its growth and attempt to regenerate. His eyes focused on Tetsumi, he wondered what in the hell was he doing standing about, it looked as if he was praying."No God can save you, you'll die real soon."

//Tetsumi didn't say not a word, he tried hard to focus on his goal. If he lost focus, if his cocentration was broken, he'd surely lose sight of this technique. He'd lose all attempts of his plan to come into play, he wouldn't allow this to happen, as long as he could help it. "Almost..just a little while longer." in actuallity he needed to wait a bit.

//Shukaku smiled, his arms finnally restored."Now. Time to finish this, you've been a pain kid. I can give you that much, but worthless either way."Formed another handseal, maybe another wind attack would break his will, mentally and physically as well. Elemental chakra formed in its gut, channeling this wind natured chakra towards his mouth his cheeks grew. He'd just need to focus a single bullet of wind. Expelling this bullet of wind towards Tetsumi, it raced forward.

//Tetsumi watched in horror, his eyes closed preparing for the assault. On its own, his sand reacted. It bent to its will of protecting Tetsumi from certain death or injury. The shield shaped into a six headed figure he couldn't identify from behind, either way it crumbled right away saving him. He continued to meld chakra in exchange for the jutsu's sucessful. Each moment passed was able to convert his chakra into iron sand increasing his supply.

//Shukaku grunted, "What the hell?..Shield such a nuisance, and its not my doing." The child was finished, he'd make his way over towards Tetsumi's position. Each step shook the floor, but it'd take him a while he wasn't the fastest beast after all.

//Tetsumi grinned as the beast neared him, one of its hands extended outward only now he'd taken into account of the markings on the beast, what were they? It was alien to him, all he knew was that he had to defend himself the arm raced forward. At this point he'd gathered enough iron sand, a large amount of it covered the once golden floor.

//Tetsumi "You're in my wolrd now Shukaku." with that said, each grain of iron sand piled up, stacked up manipulated by the teen himself. It was formed into waves of iron sand, but he didn't stop there, he continued the patern until it formed a tsunami of iron sand. The teen groaned, his body ached. Propeling the iron sand tsunami forward, it rushed forward, slamming into the shukaku's body. Despite this the beast stayed firm, it was indeed impressive yet scary seeing it hold on through all of this. But, his plan wasn't to exactly win, just force it back into its cage per say.

//Shukaku, "UGHHH, YOU LITTLE!!! DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ME!" It tried to lift its arms to form another seal or manipulate sand. //Tetsumi That..he couldn't allow this is where his plan two came into effect. A rather large hand formed out of the large amount of iron sand, it raced forward its palm opened attmpting to push the beast backwards further this utilized the force of the iron sand tsunami and this in conjuction for the extra help.

//Shukaku body was forced backwards, utimately back into its cage. The ancient letter glowed as it reapplied itself.//Tetsumi, though before pushing the beast in, he'd try to retract the hand after the dead was done. Thus revealing something to him, he'd grabbed a hold of the tanuki's chakra in the process. This chakra was retracted, as it neared him it flowed into him inhabiting every fiber of his being imbuing him with power."I-I..I can't!!!" the teen fell backwards passing out. 

//Shukaku stared down at the child from back within his cage."I can't believe..I lost..to a human. This kid, he's somethin' else.." his voice became heavy, he too fell asleep, its golden gleam from its eyes fading away. 

//The floor beneath Tetsumi gave way, he fell into endless darkness. Though he wasn't aware of his decent. When his eyes reopened in the real world, his body was covered in iron sand. Both of his eyes resembled the beast's own, this time he didn't feel an implus to kill or reep vengence, though maybe this was due to him being exhausted. The sand crumbled away from his body, it fell to the ground revealing his smooth skin as well as the gourd he logged around."D-Did I win?" the teen questioned as he stared at his hands indisbelief, he'd actually won against the tanuki.* - Sat Oct 17 10:53:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was caught off guard by this, his attention was focused on Ai and whatever they seemed to be discussing. He'd looked extra lost the moment Madelyn bumped into him, her tone, her mannerism..It pissed him off, only one other being had such a tone towards him."OH?! YOU THINK I'M AFRAID OF YOU?!" that's what he wanted to say, but in reality what really came out was.."I'm sorry. I didn't mean it." 

From such an action, in the back of his mind a voice laughed was screeching, "PUSSSY!!!!! YOU ARE BALLESS, AHAHAAHA!" this voice caused the teen's left eye to twitch a little.* - Sat Oct 17 22:41:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: This one is crazy...I should avoid her harder. - Sat Oct 17 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "That...Why does it.." just watching Madelyn reminded him of himself in the past, he was just like this. It reminded him of his darkest times, when the lack sleep, the villagers, the voices, anything really pissed him off, he wanted to be alone. All of it he wanted it to end, so he did things differently. If it hadn't been for a select few of shinobi including his adoptive mother, he'd been in a different light. Hell probably in Zetsumo's shoes."Mhmm..Could you guys..Please don't try to attack her." he hoped the others respected his words and stupid ass decision he was about to make.

Slowly, with causion he'd approach the female."Hey." he'd his hands were held out, mainly so she wouldn't think he was going to attack or trick her.* - Sat Oct 17 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'm an idiot.. - Sat Oct 17 22:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: But..It can't be helped, I know how it was for me. Things made it worse when people attacked, despised my very existence. - Sat Oct 17 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: ...Fucking...this won't make things better. It'll just worsen em'. - Sat Oct 17 23:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) silently thanked Sanoke as he stopped Shin, even if Shin meant well it didn't go well in situations like this. Crowds, with good intentions or not, in this type of mental state it didn't matter, he knew the feeling. That was his life after all, he'd probably been in the same position as Madelyn. 

He'd continue to slowly approach the female, his hands extended outward infront of himself, a gesture that meant he held no ill will towards her. His eyes also took note of the paper manipulated by Ai. He held no fear, if he was to be attack due to her mental state, his sand would protect him, just like the people that cared about his will being in the past. 

Once nearing her new position a  kind smile formed on  his lips."Don't say that, I'm sure your sister and your family care dearly about you. I could of envy you ya'know, you have the luxary of having a family ya'know." he could've felt the emotions flowing out of her in any sylable she spoke. He'd extend his left hand outwards towards her offering her his hand, in a lowered tone he'd whisper"You can trust me, I have no intentions of hurting you or hating you." he hoped his words were genuine, but she probably wouldn't buy it. * - Sun Oct 18 00:03:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) really hoped his words got through, but they didn't at all. His hand that desperately tried to reach for her but she'd attempt to knock it away. The teen didn't even flinch, blackened sand, iron sand materialized out of thin air blocking yet protecting Tetsumi from harm against Madelyn's hand that would've knocked his hand away. 

He'd look at the sky for a second, "What would you do in this situation." despite his loss family wise, the lose of friends and so on, one person tried and continued to try to reach out for him. "It was the light." the teen thought while continuing forward, instead of trying to hurt her anything rash, he'd widened his wing span. His arms were held out, he'd approach the female attempting to hug her, if successful he'd say."I don't plan on killing. I know how you feel, you aren't a threat. I'm Tetsumi, who are you?" he wasn't aquainted with her sister, to be honest he usually kept to himself as well.* - Sun Oct 18 00:51:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was pushed away by Madelyn. He didn't feel threatened by such an action, progress wasn't s"Its great to meet you, Madelyn. And as Ai said, we're here for you." he'd look towards the sky, then back to Madelyn noticing the blood self inflicted wound..blood leaked from this wound. His body quivered a bit, blood..it always unsettled the demons within a little."Mhmm...Madelyn we're here for ya, ya'know. Well when ever you're in the mood to talk."

He'd extend a hand outward while he focused, utilizing chakra along iron sand appeared out of thin air."Tch..doing this always takes a while." he thought, he'd gathered the right amount, once done it began molding taking on an enteriely different shape. The shape morphed, once it was finished a miniature skulpture of Madelyn in his arms, "Some people, will try everything to try and help, though its up to you in allowing them in ya'know." he'd attempt to approach her once more gifting her with the skulpture made out of iron sand.* - Sun Oct 18 01:32:35 2015

You have to try, she's family at the end of the day. Lacking the love of love ones, knowing that they won't have your back. I-It makes things worse, trust me." he tried to speak out on Madelyn's behalf, it wasn't his place but he saw a lot of himself in Madelyn. Only those that were not deceased knew of his past, the murders, the madness, his disreguard for preserving life, he was a monster akin to the one within him.

"You dropped this Madelyn." he'd make a and gesuture, the statue he'd made for her levitated towards Madelyn's position. It'd keep levitating out infront of her until she'd grabbed a hold of it.* - Sun Oct 18 02:13:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) wasn't feeling the drill at all, in all honesty his spirit was elsewhere at the moment. Then again that was the pourpose of this drill, to get his mind off of trival things and coming to a kind of understanding and resolution to his fears. Everything that clouded his mind at the moment, he dismissed them, with those lingering thoughts it wouldn't allow him to attain peace within himself. In simple terms, he detached himself from this world.

He'd begin to decend towards the sand below, it was warm. He moved into a meditative stance, his legs were crossed, his eyes closed, and his hand slowly motioned towards the mid-section of his body. There he'd brought his hands closer together at the center of his being, both of his hands pressed together. His heart rate decreased, meaning he was becoming a lot calmer than before, it couldn't be helped a part of him wanted to fight Mirai but in his role as a jounin and moral he'd live by..Senseless scuffles, brawls, stupid conflicts like this caused issues among shinobi.

Tetsumi followed Sanoke's teachings, he memorized his very first drill down to the last, it worked like muscle memory to him at this point. "Peace..something...That makes me..happy, at peace." he'd slowly decend into his subconious, everything around him, the world of blood shed, conflicts, death, it became non existant to the teen at the time being. He was shut out to the world, from Sanoke, to his sister Izanami, even the sand bellow his rump, it was fogotten.

In his mind, he invisioned himself in a field. It was filled with life, numerous flowers grew in this place, filling it with an array of colors. Though he was alone, alone but at peace. He'd lay back, falling back into the grass. It was comfortating, but in this action grass got into his noes, making him sneeze. He'd rub his noes, "Shouldn't have done that, its not the same as if those happy plays, ehehe."

In this happy world, a voice boom through out it as if God or a higher being was conforsating with him, making his presence known."This place doesn't fit you, someone that preaches about peace all the time. Its a bit gloomy to me, there isn't a single soul here." it was shukaku's voice.

//Tetsumi, "No..its a'ight. I need to relax, though its a bit depressing, ehehe." though Izanami's constant 'Mmmmmmm'ing' was ignored, not because he wanted to, just simple because he detached himself from the world around him for this drill. On the outside Tetsumi looked at peace, he even kept smiiling to himself as if he was deranged even.* - Sun Oct 18 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) everything around the teen vanished, Shukaku's voice becoming distant as well. Opening his eyes he'd noticed Sanoke infront of him."Mhmm...Maybe." he'd look up at the sky, though he wasn't sure his insomnia was quite cured as yet, who knew.* - Sun Oct 18 03:59:21 2015
