<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) remained awake the entire time, he hadn't fallen asleep not even for a peep. The jounin was focused towards the ceiling, his hands folded across his chest. There was blood visible by his right arm, a large deep gash. But he hadn't actually went that deep, it just looked it. If it weren't for his sand shield and iron sand armor, he'd be finished.

"Mhmm?" look over towards Bryson once he heard his voice."Couldn't save her." he'd continue to repeat over and over like a broken record. He was fixed on this for some reason, now he knew Ai would hate him for being weak.. So weak he couldn't save someone that made his friend happy, he was a fail shinobi.* - Fri Nov  6 09:40:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) focused on Bryson the moment bright light glowed from his hands that healed his wound he'd obtained in the fight. He'd release a sigh, despite this he felt relieaved since the pain from the wound was being reduced a little as time passed.* - Fri Nov  6 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) would be seen sitting on the bench, the right side of his body about from his shoulder bandaged but otherwise the teen was his normal self. He'd notice Kana but he hadn't said a word, on the inside he was happy she'd have survived. In the grasp of his left hand was the female's scarf.* - Fri Nov  6 19:35:02 2015

He debated in his mind if to do anything but he'd decided against it for the time being, sometimes people needed a moment of silence for themselves and to catch themselves. Maybe he'd count to twenty in his mind then bother her, it was a trival decision.* - Fri Nov  6 19:41:52 2015

"W-What the?.." the teen questioned, at this time he'd feel a cold gust of wind sweeping over him. It was a weird sensation, he'd look at his right hand the same hand he signed the raccoon contract with."Weird." he'd say while continuing the count down in his mind, a count down to decide if to bother Kana or not.* - Fri Nov  6 19:52:57 2015

Using his left hand he'd rub the back of his head nervously and nod his head agreeing to Sanoke's statement. His right arm about from his shoulder blade area over a little and down was wrapped in bandages."Yeah..I'll be a'ight." he felt a lot better though he wasn't going to over do it.* - Fri Nov  6 22:25:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: And no, he didn't fly. He swung his blade, it would cause you to float and he'd use the gravity to his advantage and attack while you're pinned down or falling back down from gravity reseting. - Fri Nov  6 22:32:32 2015

Either way he'd take off his shoes and leave the pair of sandals at the door. After this step he'd advance towards the table where Izanami and Ivel were seated at, alligning his but over one of the many meditation pillows he'd sit down.

Once seated he'd cross both legs into his meditative stance, he'd arc an eyebrow after hearing Fujitora's words. He'd simply say while focusing on the man, "I'm aware, also promised you wouldn't do anything of that nature. I'll keep the family techniques secret, as they were meant to be." hell he even possessed knowleadge on how to perform the cloath binding fuuinjutsu.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) glared at Fujitora's eyes with pure hate, "..Those eyes..." the only thing he saw and replayed in his mind was the day Hideki stared into his own eyes, in doing so he was under a genjutsu. If it werent for Shukaku's help, he'd have been doomed, who knew what the other sharingan weilder had in mind, especially with the constant questions about the tanuki. But what did he expect? He did destroy konoha, hatred had to be earned from such an ordeal.

His eyes moved away from Fujitora's own, mainly focusing on his chest. He feared making eye contract in all honesty despite him being his step father. "Labyrinth? A'ight, piece of cake." that were the only words that came out of the teen's mouth, though he wondered how dangerous the island truely was.

"Despite this, I need to learn more about Fuuinjutsu. I don't care about the cost, i'm not afraid of no damn island." these words were all thoughts circulating in his mind.* - Sat Nov  7 06:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Thank You for the chat" he'd wave before leaving the hassan's office, even shutting the door behind of him.* - Sat Nov  7 11:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) appeared on the scene, as his figure came into focus black sand swirled around him briefly. He'd release a yawn while taking note of everyone in the square, even Lero whom seemed to be speaking with a blade?..And people thought Tetsumi was weird when the teen used to converse with himself.* - Sat Nov  7 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Whats she been doing now...? - Sat Nov  7 11:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Sat Nov  7 11:44:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Maybe... I should just.....go back to what I was doing. - Sat Nov  7 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) had a moment of dizziness, a drawback from the unmastered shunshin. The dizzy spell took over him, he'd stumble forward towards Zenaki. He'd rub the side of his head, his eyes focusing on Zenaki. He didn't care for how Zenaki was dressed, many things he didn't care about any longer in this world, this were many of those things. He'd attempt to sit down next to the woman on the sand, "Yo.." he'd whisper in a lowered tone trying to catch her attention.* - Sat Nov  7 11:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) tried to force a smile, though he only wanted Zenaki to feel comfortable around him, well she probably was already but Tetsumi wasn't aware of this. "You're up early.. I'm usually the only person up around this time... well.. One of the few." it was true, the teen didn't sleep.. His insomnia was the real deal, his dark markings were visible around the teen's eyes as if he had on eye liner or was part raccoon.* - Sat Nov  7 11:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Of course he did, He is alive you know. - Sat Nov  7 12:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Shrug* - Sat Nov  7 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) yawned a little, "I see. I guess that mean's they're a healty." he didn't know where to go with the conversation, this wasn't his strong suit at all."Um..soo... What type of research?" it wasn't his intrest to know, he just grabbed at anything to start or continue their conversation.* - Sat Nov  7 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: . . . - Sat Nov  7 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Medical stuff huh?.. Oh.. Okay." that explained enough for the teen, though as she went on about how many books she had in possession a blank stare came over him.. It was an unbelieveable amount, especially if she actually reread every book. It was a little to much, especially for the strategist. 

"I see..." he didn't know where else to go with the conversation, then it struck him! He'd say something in a lowered tone, it was hard to make out.* - Sat Nov  7 12:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: Umm... That thing that Bryson was speaking of.. How do you... How would you even do that?.. I'm.. lost I guess? About the whole thing, its a scary idea but it also opens up a wider array of possibilities for me. - Sat Nov  7 12:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: That thing Bryson was speaking off?  - Sat Nov  7 12:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: Oh.. the poison or somethin' of that nature. - Sat Nov  7 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Oh. Yes. Making poisons? - Sat Nov  7 12:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: *nod*... - Sat Nov  7 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: *nod* I don't know if I am allowed to teach you it. But I guess I can ask Master if I am allowed. Plus I can explain you some sort?  - Sat Nov  7 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: S-Sure.. I'm willing to learn.. Well. Learn some things about it. I'm not even sure how it'd sit if I mixed my sand in poison to begin with. - Sat Nov  7 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: This is one to paralyze an opponent.  - Sat Nov  7 12:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Just a simple simple scratch on the arm and the arm will be dissable in a few seconds.  - Sat Nov  7 12:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) recieved the small seringe from the woman, he'd eye it down weirdly examining it further before placing it on his lap. He'd whisper once again.* - Sat Nov  7 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: I'd try it on myself but.. my sand has a mind of its own. Maybe I'll try it on someone in a spar to test it out. - Sat Nov  7 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Mhm. It is just a thing to paralyze. It can't kill. It isn't that heavy of a poison. If you are going to try it out. Perhaps I can watch? If you want to. Just for my own studies again. - Sat Nov  7 12:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: Sure, you could watch. - Sat Nov  7 12:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Alright. - Sat Nov  7 12:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh yes. - Sat Nov  7 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hey Sanoke. - Sat Nov  7 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I haven't seen you in a while... - Sat Nov  7 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ortho...no he is alive... - Sat Nov  7 13:01:13 2015
