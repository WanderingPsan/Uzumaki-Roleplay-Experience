<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) brought both of his hands up to the mid-section of his body, he'd clasp both of his hands gathering chakra. A swirl of blackened sand materialized around his figure for a moment, it masked his figure as he vanished from his seat.* - Wed Oct 14 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) reappeared somewhere else, away from his previous location. In truth he utilized the body flicker technique to distance himself away from the group of shinobi. With so much intel he'd gathered so far, it was depressing..Could he really trust the shinobi within sunagakure? Could he ever? "They're hunting a beast now, tch.." the teen gripped his stomach tightly, though he hoped it wasn't another beast like that one that resided within himself or the kind that dwelled within his adoptive mother kastya. "Maybe its not the same kind of beast." he still didn't know much about the situation, though he'd overheard it from Fujitora.

In this moment of deep thought the sand beneath his feet vibrated, a giant sand fly? Of some sort flew from beneath the surface."Tch..It did have another one, fucking pests.." he'd taken a step forward but stopped himself, he'd look off into the distance as it flew where ever it might've been headed."Should I help them..." screams of villagers, mostly children caught his attention. "...Just this once..." the teen mumbled. He'd known of the past sand worm abilities, maybe this one had the same type of genjutsu ability..This he didn't want to find nore fall victim to it, which would leave himself open."I'll have to lore it out of the village, then i'll kill it with -that- technique."

The iron cork from the teen's gourd removed itself, it flew towards the sand below as a steady flow of blackened sand was released. This blackened sand, iron sand was channeled to the teen's feet where it became dense. A strip of iron secured his footing, he head to make one more precaution before he went into battle. He'd held out his hand, ear plugs of iron materilized out of thin air, this was inserted into his ears..It was a way to counter the insect's genjutsu if it retained this ability like the worms. The platform rose, higher and higher until it flew off after the insect, though he'd distance himself. He'd brought two fingers up to his left eye, pressing it against the eye as well as applying chakra. Iron sand materilized taking on the shape of an eye, this eye soared through the air in search of the beast and the situation at hand before he reacted.* - Wed Oct 14 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: First gate open! - Wed Oct 14 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: They haven't the idea..what they're into. Wonder which one will die first. - Wed Oct 14 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: The game begins. - Wed Oct 14 04:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: omit - Wed Oct 14 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm..this'll end nasty. Guess its time to assist partially." the thought, at this time the eye of iron sand converted back into iron sand and blew away with the passing wind. "Mhmm..Attacks won't work on its body, I have an idea..Just need to relay the message." with that said a steady flow of blackened sand flowed out and darted outward at the battlefied. Arrving at this location, it seemed as if the sand storm created by the beast blew in, blackened sand? Weird. 

The blackened sand blew about as it molded, taking on the shape of a teen a gourd won on his back. Both of the clone's hands were held up across its body in an 'X' formation trying to brace against the attack."You guys need to held this thing off, i'll be able to take care of it..in a few.In about..(four turns, how ever much time that is ic..) flee, get away from the beast." with this, if the clone was destroyed or not in this turn it'd disperse and probably not reform.

Tetsumi stod in the distance, his hands clasped as he gathered chakra. Hopefully his location was safe enough, and it was away from the battlefield.* - Wed Oct 14 05:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: All right. - Wed Oct 14 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "He moves so fast.." the teen thought while traveling by air with the aid of his platform of iron sand. Sanoke left nothing but a trail of kicked up sand in his path, this made it a lot easier for him to be tracked. Though he'd made a sudden stop below forcing Tetsu to stop as well, he'd begin to decend from the sky above wondering if this was the place where he'd be trying to achieve 'Hakuna Matata' as the man told Fuji. 

Tetsumi turned to Sanoke to better yet reply to his question, "Oh..Just I traveled for a while before returning to this village. In my travels, I found a peaceful place where I could meditate. Ya'know, focus with out distractions. Though that was cut short since the village had an order for him back, he could've easily fled but he knew he'd probably gain more enemies in the long run from that action.* - Wed Oct 14 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) observed Sanoke's state of meditation, he looked at peace with himself. Though he wasn't aware how intuned the turtle hermit might've been with the world around him.  He listened intently to the man's words about his master's teaching, his words, his beliefs. It ran through his mind, over and over like a broken record destined to play over on the same old track. 

The manipulator slowly motioned towards the floor, though as his hands touched down that's when the heat from the sand got to him."O-OUCH!!!" the teen bellowed as he fanned his burning palm. Despite how hot the sand might've been from the heat it observed from the sun Sanoke seemed unfazed by it..at one. He wanted to be like this, at peace with the monsters in his head..Besides the tanuki, beneath all of this -hate- he carried..he had two halfs of himself, one that believed in peace. This person was himself, while there was another that represented complete opposite views of the spectrum, the coin per say. He wanted nothing but revenge, death, all humans to die for the pain he felt inside. That was the essence of the other voice besides the Tanuki's voice that he drowned it, it was the voice he suppressed deep within him, the side of him that had to reguard for human like in the past.

He'd suck up the pain, he'd mimicked Sanoke's meditative stance. His feet were crossed, his eyes closed. All he saw was darkness. At this time both of his hand motioned up to the mid-section of his body as he clasped his hands. It seemed as if twenty minutues passed, nothing happened...He was on the verge of giving up, calling a quits. As he thought about doing such a thing old memories flowed through his mind. A voice..that voice the other that voice that wasn't the Tanuki's spoke up.

"All you do is gave up so easily, that's why i'm here. Do you really think you could suppress me for so long, Tetsumi?!" the voice materialized sharing memories of the teen's past first. All of the memories were depressing ones, memories filled with pain. Memories that left scars on Tetsumi's heart, scars that he tried so hard to hide, shield from the world to mask his pain. The memories that he'd see where his past where his pain begun. 

The darkness in his head dissipated, his mind cleared up to reveal a younger Tetsumi. He sat down at a dinner table, four other individuals were seated enjoying dinner. His mother, his father, Gintoki his grandfather, and Gintoki's wife his grandmother. In the outside world a tear trickled down from the teen's eye as a tear drop escaped. The voice spoke up, "You were so weak, you weren't able to protect them, stop them from dying in the war. A shame what happened to them." Tetsumi tried to reach out to these deceased four, "Mother, Father, Grand..Pa..Grams.." both hands were extended outward trying to hug them while his younger self sat back having dinner, shooting peas at Gintoki for fun. Each one that Tetsumi tried to hug phazed right through him like mist or an illustion.

The memory changed, a jounin from the village gifted him with his parents headbands and an apology..It was war..this was the dreaded fruit it gifted the young, epecially the loved ones of the fallen. He'd witness his younger self crying, he sympathized feeling the  same exact feelings coursing through him again. His grandfather and grandmother weeped as well, though Gintoki seemed to hold it in..Something he hadn't noticed from before, he had to be the man to hold the family together now. The memory flickered, he'd see a younger version of himself at the academy. All of the kids dodged him, he was weird after all. It was around this time he awakened his ability to manipulate iron sand, something that they didn't understand as much. To them he was a freak, it was the ability he inherited from his father.

The memory flickered once more, his younger self was pestering Jak for answers about his grandfather Gintoki's whereabouts, "He's on vacation Jiki." the man replied, the Kazekage also promised he'd be back, the other voice replied through the memorie, "Funny, he never did come back did he?". The memory changed once more, all he saw was blood shed he was fighting in the war. Though this changed, he was back in the kazekage's office. Adhara, the kazekage's wife ordered all of them into the secret room, they'd recieved word that all of the shinobi dispered to konoha had been killed, even the kazekage. Why would this woman..protect them? She was in labor as well, would she risk herself and her unborn child for them? Either way, all of them were forced in the secret room. His younger self took charge, tried to make everyone calm telling them that it'd be all right. Their were noises heard in the corridor. Eventually it ceased, they waited for hours inside until he braved it to see if the woman was all right. Though all he saw..all the younger Tetsumi saw was blood, the wife of the kazekage was slain by the mist. His world had flipped upside down from this day, more tears flowed from Tetsumi's eyes on the outside in reality though he held strong and kept his meditative stance intact.

All of this friends that he'd made on that mission were gone, especially the father figure and mother figure, the kazekage and his wife were deceased as well. So much...hate..the voice piped up again."Heh, do you realize how weak you are? You can't even protect what's important. All of them, dead to protect a weakling like yourself. If I was in charge of things, like before. I'd kill each thing, everything that opposed my power, tap into the Tanuki's power and destroy everything. 

With that said the memory flickered, he witnessed himself falling asleep..Losing his mind, his sanity along the way. He'd finnally fallen asleep, sand was expelled from his being, he was consumed as the giant tanuki remerged. It attacked the village, it hurt Nautica sending him crashing through the kazekage's mansion. Shinobi tried to defend against the beast, the kazekage at the time 'Seto' tried to go toe to toe with the beast. But all attempts failed, his troops were destroyed along with half of the village, killing many adults, elderly, children as well. No one was safe from its rampage after this the beast left, leaving a trail of terror death and destruction behind it and its path. 

The memory changed, an egg was tossed at Tetsumi's figure. Though that ended in a failure, for some odd reason the sand protected him from the incoming eggs. Some managed to pass through, the sand wasn't as fast. The villagers hated him, they slurred curses at him. Threats as well, hell even the children joined in on the fun by tossing eggs at the young shinobi. Those younger shinobi were also classmates he outclassed in the academy before he graduated early."Why am I so hated, what did I-I do?!" the younger him cried, the memory flickered. He was watching his house, well what remained of it. His house was destroyed, with in it..His grandmother's corpse, she was brutally killed and hung.. like a witch. It had other deaths like this in the village, all manipulators were killed in this way, they were feared and it was his fault."You could've easily reeked havoc, you should've killled all of them. But, you're weak, ahahaha!" 

"Couldn't even save what was left of your fleeting friends, even that manipulator." his memory changed once more to himself holding Kronos's dead body in his arms. His hands were filled with blood, the deceased manipulator was at peace, a large chest was located at his chest due to the manner how he was killed.."Couldn't even save your love." the memory switched to him invisioning Amu's corpse riddled with blackened rods as the news articicle entailed.

His breathing seemed to have speeden up on the outside, it became unstable, more tears flowed from the child. "But, if I was in charge of this..Like in the past, they'd be alive. What do you say, Tetsumi?" the voice matterialized as he saw whom the voice really was..it was himself but with much hate in his eyes. Half of himself, the hate's body was consumed in sand. Half of its body was monstrous, it looked like the Tanuki's hands but comprised of iron sand..Was this how he looked while on a rampage? All of the rage he felt..it was compressed tightly in this form, pure hate that turned to a need to kill to suffice for the hate he felt inside. The beastly teen extended its monstrous hand outward to the teen, as if welcoming him...A gesture to let the voice back in, that part of him that only lived to reek havoc, lived to strip lifes, lived off of hatred.* - Wed Oct 14 20:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stared at the himself for a moment, the beastly half of himself clearly visible in his mind. His eyes begun at its monstrous hand made of iron sand, from this point his eyes continued to move up the rest of his body examining it. His right hand quivered as it motioned outward, it would attempt to reach out for this half of himself, this vengeful half of his phyche or mind. He wanted to hold undo this half, side of himself, reep vengence, as he did this a memory became clear in his mind. He'd be forced to witness what happened to konoha while he was asleep, he'd given into his rage when Amu died. It was all clear, the tanuki fell from the sky. Its tail crashed into the wall of konoha, a mighty roar boomed from his figure. Though it was much different from the last time he'd seen it, it was coated in iron sand armor. 

He felt the rage emitted from deep within the beast, it was the rage he'd felt on that day..The rage that prompted him to attack konoha in the first place, sand kicked up..It was molded from the beast's chakra, it crushed the earth below creating more sand. Waves of sand piled up, it pushed backwards, climbing climbing gaining power..It grew taller than the village, villagers scurried about, childen watched in horror, they prayed. Shinobi were at the gate, they tried to attack but the beast's defenses were to powerful to dend against, they would fall victim to his hatred that the beast fed off of. 

The sand raced forward, washing over the village, burrying a large amount of the village as well as the people inside. They drowned to death from the beast's sand, its power."You see, if you allow me in. I'll be able to tap into the Tanuki's power, you'll have power, you'll be able to destroy what ever comes in your way. How can you thin twice about this?" he observed as the beast slurred curses at the village. A chill was felt in the air, blackend chakra formed at its mouth. The whole situation was madness, the villagers that managed to survive tried to get away. Hell even their kage, the man in power fled leaving his villagers to die.

The blackened energy that gathered compressed into a sphere of raw power, even from watching the memory of the experience made him uncomfortable. From there the beast ate the sphere, the reason was unknown for the child..Maybe it tried to kill him using this method, but that wasn't the answer nore true. Its cheeks increased in size as a wave or beam of raw power was released from it. It blinded Tetsumi's sight momenteriely, it was a flash of white light as the village was consumed in its power. With his vision clearing up, all he witnesed was rubble and a crater that was once the hokage's mansion. 

Shukaku roared in truimph and the memory changed, he'd be once again facing himself that was consumed in the beast's cloak, though only half of the version of himself that he tried to reach out to."You see, with this power. Nothing, and I mean nothing. Will stand in our way!" he'd almost even taken the beast's arm but something..a voice rang through the mayhem in his mind, it was Sanoke's voice.

"You are the only one that can control you. This is where your personality, or your resolve will be shown." Some of the words from the outside world was eaten away, clustered up eaten away from reaching Tetsumi, the hate within himself made sure of this. This side of himself only wanted control for himself, control to release the tanuki from within Tetsumi, the will to control its power for itself and destroy all of the ninja villagers, the world even..He just couldn't have Tetsumi's will growing back, gaining strength, he needed him out of the picture. Though another part did stick out for the teen, it was another bit of words that made its way through, these words were sharper than any fuuton infused blade.

"There are two types of energies in this world. . . positive and negative. It' up to you decide if the negative emotions in you will overpower the positive. Don't be so selfish as to blame all of the hardships on yourself. It wasn't within your power to prevent the tragedies, thus it isn't your fault." those words were sharp, on the outside it had its effect on Tetsumi. More tears flowed from his eyes, the killer intent felt from him subsided for a moment before picking back up, the chakra being emitted from him..it wasn't the normal chakra or feeling this peace maker had at its disposal.

"Those words..its like.." in his mind he pictured the words to the fortune cookie Amu gifted him once, it read."Only you can decide your own path." his hand stopped from grasping on to the beastly half of himself's power. He almost forgot, he almost was devoured changed by his old way of thinking. His hand retracted back to his side, his other half looked up at weird."What is it? What is it going to be?"

A bright smile was won on Tetsumi's face, "I won't resort to this, i'll find another way. This me..You would defy Kastya's wishes, you would defy my friends wishes and sacrifices. I won't allow this." "Those memories you showed me, they weren't..exactly true." as he said this he'd hold out both of his hands grasping on to the teen's normal hand as well as the beastly arm. He would progect his thoughts and memories into this half of himself that was nothing but hatred. 

Both of them would be side to die, back in time where they arrived at the academy. Hell it was true, his time their was rouge especially with his gift of magnetism and strategism. Both of them witnessed there self, a younger happier version of himself having fun, playing with other kids at the academy. A group of them that weren't fearful of his ability, hell they even wanted him to do tricks utilizing the sand, that's how he first begun fine tuning his ability shaping things like kunai out of the sand he carried around his waist in pouches. These students loved him, they were his friends, savae was among these friends, he too a manipulator but of a different grain.

The memory changed, both of himselves were observing a younger version of themself playing pranks of the first kazekage jak. Despite his loss of Gintoki, the man pushed him forward to improve himself besides pranks. As well as Adahra, the love washed over the two as the memory changed.  Infront of the two was Kastya, another jinchuriki beast like himself. She tried everything to get Tetsumi to budge, showering him with gifts and love until she adopted him. Such a burden, especially with the beast dorment within her as well. A smile formed on the young emo child, he was loved, the memory changed.

It flickered to the shinobi protecting Tetsumi from the eggs thrown by the angered villagers, something that even kastya herself tried to prevent. As the kage she decreed they'd stop this, or face or wrath..A wrath that was feared as the "White Demon" of sunagkure The other half of himself, the hatred or what remained of it began flickering..its essence flickering out of existance, it felt the love. This love battled against the flames of anger, hatred, resentment, loniness gone bad. 

The hatred of Tetsumi would fall victim to yet another memory, the memory of Amu and himself reunited, they hugged embraced themselves on the battlefield after the attack.. it was the war that zetsumo left behind after fleeing leaving more allied shinobi dead even. "Its you, its really you. You've grown Tetsumi, i'm not letting you go." it was obvious this Amu was different than the one before. For one, she wasn't skinny, signs that she was starving in her time imprisioned in Amegakure to do nothing but labor. She was healthy, and her words chaneged a bit, though the words were the same, she didn't want the teen to go, to be lost like everyone else.

The hatred within Tetsumi continued to flicker, its flame going out."N-No..If I burn out..W..What'll happen to me..." The real Tetsumi beamed at him, "Don't worry, you're always apart of me, just like everyone else." as he said this, all of the deceased shinobi were at his side, all of them that he held close to his heart, the memories of them that made his will unshaken, uncorrupted. All of them placed a hand on this side of Tetsumi, the embodyment of his hatred. "It'll be okay." different voices entierily different echod in unison.  "I see...Maybe..Maybe I will be at peace.." its flame died out, it vanished from existance for the last time.

All of what the hatred of himself felt, flowed into him. It was warm, it made him smile in this world and on the outside."So warm." it felt like he was issued a hug from within, a thank you from his hatred within. Tetsumi closed his eyes, he fell bywards, free falling through the darkness that soon became light. He bathed in it, he felt enlightened to an extent.. In the outside world, his eyes reopened a hand brought up to his eye wiping away the tears."Thank you Sanoke." the teen thanked him for this experience, he actually felt at peace, but it wasn't over as yet. There still remained the Tanuki that loathed him, the Tanuki that wanted to devour his will and escape in the process.* - Wed Oct 14 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) laughed a little, though as he tried to stand up as well..his feet were asleep as well."Damnit!!! My feet...!" the teen cursed, though he stubbornly moved forward until deciding he'd resolve this once he was safe back within the village. The iron cork from his gourd slackened as it fell to the ground, blackened sand flowed out of the gourd, it gathered beneath the manipulator's feet.

"Mhmm..If you need a lift, all you have to is ask." his words were for Sanoke, if he hadn't an issue with it a second flow of chakra would've been released from the gourd. Its intent to form below Sanoke's feet forming a platform that gifted flight from the material. If he refused he'd wave as the platform rose into the air wisking him away into the village.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Yo let's go." the teen called after Reguel as he walked away from the square. Both of them would regroup at the village's gate.* - Thu Oct 15 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Wait what? - Thu Oct 15 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thought about Hassan's words, mainly on the part where the man said 'run to the edge of the land of wind', yeah..he wasn't going to do exactly that. His method would be quicker and would cover much more ground than running with his physical capabilities. Flight would be the best answer for him, plus he'd probably have enough time when he'd return to continue his training, who knew. Though for now, forming an alliance with the village at the edge of the wind country. From what the geezer spoke, it seemed like a strategic point as well as a great investment in the long run. 

"Heh, this'll be fun." the teen joked, the iron cork from his gourd reacted as he spoke. It slackened, falling towards the ground converting back into iron sand below his feet. More of the material flowed from the gourd to the child's feet forming below. He'd make another handesture, causing another torrent of iron sand to form below Reguel's feet once more. The sand became dense, both of the platforms hoovered towards the sky, once in the air both of the platforms joined together forming a singular platform for transportation measures.

"Mhmm..Are you a good talker?" the teen asked while controling the platform towards their destination.* - Thu Oct 15 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to propel the platform of iron forward, it raced through the sky at a faster pace versus traversing the sandy terrain below. He'd speak up while looking back on their orders. "Well, we're supposed to go to this village on the outskirts..well edge of the wind country and try to allie with em'. Seems simple..I guess. But they're probably stubborn since they are self reliant, there is a ninety percent chance they won't accept out help in partner ship. Either way, if that doesn't work..I may have an idea, but that's a last resort."

A mischievious grin was visible on Tetsumi's face, one belonging to a prankster. Ever since his training had begun he was able to feel his old emotions a lot better, they were much clearer and controlled rather than suppressed."When the village comes into focus, i'll land and call off this technique. It won't be..smart if I flew over and landed in this village. It won't allow em' to trust me nore for my last resort plan to work.* - Thu Oct 15 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm..Don't know, it sucks because they're stubborn either way. Which makes this ten times as difficult as it'd usually be." a rather large village came into focus in the distance."I'll lower the platform now." with that the platform lowered downward towards the sand below. He'd stretched a little as the sand returned to his gourd, out of what remained of the material a cork of iron sand formed this was placed at the top of his gourd sealing it off from further use. 

"We'll have to keep up apperances. With that said, we'll have to be well mannered." to him Reguel didn't seem like a bad or mouty person, but it was incase things became sour and such an attitude was drawn out. 

Once the two arrived at the gate to the village he'd bow, two rather large musculer men were stationed their."We've came to speak to your leader."

//Guard One."Mhmm..You're the hidden sand shinobi he sent. All right, you may enter. Hogo, escourt these two to lady Hitsumei!"

//Hogo escourted the two to lady Hitsumei's office. The place seemed simple, it wasn't even girly in nature, it was straight up business."Ma'am, the sand shinobi are here.

//Lady Hitsumei faced away from the group, her back turned to them while she did something else. "What do you two want?" the asked while looking through something that was hidden to the two.

//Tetsumi "We"ve came here to nogociate some kind of allience. It'll ne beneficial for the hidden sand and your village as allies. It'll be an asset for yourself and your village and suna." the teen's tone was kind, it wasn't harsh nore cold like how it usually was.* - Thu Oct 15 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //Lady Hitsumei turned to face the two, she seemed to be about in her twenties, her breast were a little above average, her rump..that was another case though it was hidden for the most part while she sat."I'm not intrested. Your village is weak, it won't be an asset instead it'll be a hindrance.

Tetsumi remained calm out the outside, in his mind he commented."You little..." though nothing was little bout this woman."Maybe you could reconsider? Trust me we're under new leadership and way more impressive than in the past."

//Lady Hitsumei continued to shoo away the shinobi, "Just leave my sight. You'r leeches, that's all your great nation has become. Its nothing like when my grandfather ruled my village, at that time. That's when shinobi of your village were an asset and threat. Now..Its reduced to nothing, look at you two."

Tetsumi's left eye twitched for a moment, a half smile stretched along his face."May..I be excused? I'll be back. I need to use the bathroom." The teen left, it was time for his plan B, he didn't expect to resort to this but things changed. He needed their help, it was his mission. The teen left.

//Lady Hitsumei laughed, "See..Can't even take a little heat. You children should go home. This is the big leagues, you aren't ready."

In privacy Tetsumi prepared his jutsu. He'd brought two fingers up to his eye channeling chakra. Iron sand gathered, it formed into an eye granting him sight beyond his point of view. Out of the sand from his gourd the desired amount of iron sand was conjured, it was a replica, clone of Tetsumi conjured from the sand. "Now play your part." he suggested to the clone as it left for the head huncho's office.  He conjured a large amount of iron sand, it took him some time but it compressed, forming into a large mole. This rather large sized mole dug under the sand, it'd appear in the village destroying houses and knocking away its mode of defenses, the people that took guard.

Tetsumi's Clone."Trouble! We'll take care of it lady hitsumei. We are more than capable to take care of this threat." The clone waited for Reguel to get ready to attack the giant mole.

The attacks that the villagers seemed to have dealt were non effective. The eye of sand hoovered above observing the event."Mhmm..Reguel attack it, play the part." the original thought from a secure location.* - Thu Oct 15 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) in the end, the two gained an alliance with the village.* - Thu Oct 15 04:23:40 2015
