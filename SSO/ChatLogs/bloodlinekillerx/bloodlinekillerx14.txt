<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) observed from a distance, maybe he was just weird by himself. Other people slept, he didn't sleep not even a wink..sometimes it grew boring, maybe he'd bother those two though they seemed busy training. "Taijutsu?" he'd questioned in a hushed tone, his hands were placed in his pockets observing learning quietly. 

Eventually the hermit fell, he'd try to snuff the impending laughter away but he couldn't thus releasing it."Hahaha!" its been a while since he'd seen something funny, though he wouldn't look down on him. For one he was better in Taijutsu for him, secondly he helped him establish a better relationship with the beast within. 

He'd approach the two causiously incase he'd end up walking into a lovey dovey moment, "Yo, was that faceplant apart of the drill?" the teen joked, he'd try to mimic the same stances but lost balance as well, falling to the side towards the sand."Wha?..maybe..it wasn't that simple." the teen thought, both of his hands moved skyward and slanted to the side like an opposite"L" utilizing his heightened reflexes it helped to compensate for this. He'd end up cartwheeling off to the side before coming to a stop. 

He'd stand to his feet, dusting off the sand on his pants as well as his hands.* - Wed Oct 21 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) laughed a little, though the laughter ended the moment Sanoke brought up Madelyn. His cheeks burned hot, turning a bright pink then reddish hue."S-She's not crazy." he'd look down towards the sand at his feet."Just misunderstood"* - Wed Oct 21 05:02:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked up from the sand below, his eyes focused on Sanoke."Yes..she reminds me of myself in the past." he'd pause thinking of assets that he liked the best about Madelyn, though he couldn't decided. He did love his girlfriend for whom she really was after, "T-Thos eyes..an-" his speech was cut off since Mirai seemed to be leaving, maybe he over steped his bonderaries? 

"I'm sorry if you're leaving because of me Mirai..I-I'll just go if its okay with you..There are other things I can be doing..Like..Watching the gate..or..or..Patrolling the village..Somethin'..." he had to 'x' off sleeping, that was a no no.* - Wed Oct 21 05:08:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sighed, before turning around leaving."I don't hate you..Nore dislike you, but its okay. I understand." he'd just leave, his spirts crushed a bit."Tetsumi, who would really like a monster like you, right?" the teen thought while leaving, his hands placed behind of his head. It was common for him, people disliked him in sunagakure period.* - Wed Oct 21 05:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stopped in his tracks, he wanted to reply, speak his mind..Say something but nothing came to mind, thanks to Sanoke's training he didn't habor as much hatred as before. Yet another sigh was released from the teen before leaving, why did he desire love from people that wouldn't accept him? It was a mystery, he did know the life and path of a jinchuriki would never be easy.* - Wed Oct 21 05:19:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I'll fill you in down here. - Wed Oct 21 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) recieved the scroll from Hassan, he hadn't the slightest idea what kind of mission he'd be expecting."I'll fill you in down here." his words were meant for Tetsuki as he walked away, just a ways away from everyone. He'd sit down at an idle bench, unravelling the scroll a "...Mhmm..." was heard from the teen's figure, his eyes analyzing th scroll's information before him."..Oh..This kind of mission..well..I guess its simple enough." the Jounin mumbled beneath his breath dissapointed, in honesty he wanted a mission where he could beat down a rouge to release his pent up anger within. But, he had to remember Tetsuki was a child after all, he didn't know her skill level, nore abilities.

"Ahem..well..There is a lost cat outside in the dessert, it seemed to have gotten away. Sad...Somehow it even made it past the guards.." the teen face palmed himself, "How are they shinobi again?" he'd thought but a smile, a forced one remained on his face."We're going to track down this cat. Though from this description, it'll be difficult since its fur is similar to the dessert's sandy color. Which makes this a bit challenging."

He'd roll up the scroll, his eyes focused on Tetsuki before standing up once more."I guess we're headed outside of the village." he'd say while walking towards the village's gate."Mhmm..You'll have to be alert and focus for it, plus I heard its pretty fast. We'll have a challenge on our hands."
* - Wed Oct 21 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) grinned, her youth, determination, and happiness made him smile. It wasn't normal that you saw people happy, usually it was all about fighting, senseless arguments, at least some of the children still held on to this ray of light, of happiness."I hope she holds on to this trait." this thought was left in his mind after he lead the way towards the Gate. 

Once at the gate he'd state his reason for leaving, In honesty he wanted to pop off at the guards for being so lowsy..How in the world could a cat get past trained killers, assains, then again it would've been his fault as well. "Mhmm..I could just use that technique to find it, then..No..This is meant to test her skills, let's see how kean she is." he'd thought while  leaving the village, his eyes scanning the area for the slightest movement. 

"Mhmm..It probably died at this rate, its so hot.." the teen commented, he suspected the cat keeled over somewhere behind a cactus or something, a death from heat stroke. But who knew, annimals found different type of ways to adapt, just like humans.

"Do you see anything?" the child asked Tetsuki, while looking towards the north west while walking.

//In the distance, if Tetsuki dared to. Towards the north east something moved, it was fast and seemed as if it was a blur.* - Wed Oct 21 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm? Over there?" the teen questioned while looking in the direction that Tetsuki pointed out. "Mhmm... All right..I'll take the left, you take the right. If it is the cat, we could make sure it doesn't escape. Unless it keeps on running forward, if so..It'll eventually tired itself out." he had a better plan involving his sand, but this was a mission to improve Tetsuki's skills, it wasn't a mission to show off or end prematurely.

//Off in the distance, something moved again. To the untrained eye it seemed like a blur or as if a sand cloud was moving across the sand.

//Tetsumi "W-Wahh?.." the teen questioned, he'd jogg forward, taking the left as planned while spacing off, he hoped Kitsuki followed this order. This'd also work out for the second portion of this plan if they were successful.* - Wed Oct 21 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stod back impressed, his hands were folded across his chest while he shook his head. Tetsuki, she held the cat he'd look over the cat while looking at the description listed in the scroll."All right, that's it. That's Tsuki. All let's go." he'd brought his right hand over Tetsuki's head before rustling her hair playfully. "You're good, Amu had to have taught you some valuable stuff Tetsuki." 

he'd left her with these words as the two traveled back towards Sunagakure to report the mission as a sucess to the geezer Hassan.* - Wed Oct 21 07:09:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: You may have the first move. - Wed Oct 21 18:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "That technique...I haven't seen it since..." the teen had a brief flash back of him in his youth participating in the Gezo's tornament, he was rather young but the same technique Kilm utilized was used on himself, it granted him the ability to fly as well.  "..Mhmm..This'll be fun." was heard from the teen below, the iron cork on his gourd slackened before it fell to the sand below. 

The moment the cork was removed blackened sand erupted from his gourd, it broke off into two sections. One section of the sand flowing towards the sand below, it increased its range spreading across the sand below. The other portion of the sand raced skyward at a fast pace aiming to catch up with Kilm and his clone.

"Mhmm..Maybe this tactic may work."* - Wed Oct 21 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: BEAT HIS ASS, TETSUMI! - Wed Oct 21 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Lightning!" the teen thought, his eyes widened. He had to think fast, the flow of sand aiming to inhabit the sand below spreading until it consumed the entire arena below, it stopped for the time being. He needed to catch Kilm in his plan quickly and effectively. 

From the sand that chased the soaring Kilm, ten shuriken formed out of the blackened sand, these shuriken were aimed for Kilm's figure attempting to either destroy the earth clone, distract him into another manuver, or probably cause him a little bit of pain. 

(Stratagem Perk) It all was according to his plan, the scheme of things. A large amount of iron sand spewed from his gourd helping to support the new addition of sand. A rather large hand formed out of the blackened sand, it extended outward hoping to either catch Kilm in its grasp attempting to end the fight. 

On the other hand, the lightning raced for Tetsumi's figure. Another portion of iron sand raced forward attempting to intercept it before it landed. This portion of iron sand worked its own, its only goal to protect Tetsumi from the lightning's attack. And if it were to break through, more would continue to try and nullify the impending dammage if it continued on through.* - Wed Oct 21 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Heh, her voice. - Wed Oct 21 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "...Mhmm.." he had to really think about his course of action, though he wasn't exactly a sitting duck despite his current situation at the hands of Kilm. There were many options the teen could've taken, though the wisest one was the true challenge. Especially since he hadn't the time in the world to plan and react to all of these attacks. His mind worked at double time, there was the lightning attack above that continued piercing through his shield until it died down just moments before striking the teen.

"That was close." but he wasn't out of danger as yet, behind of him yet another attack formed. A powerful flame raced forward, "Sister's technique." the teen thought, at least he had him where he wanted him to an extent. But the risk was too great.

On its own more of the material materialized while more of the defended against the impending attack. He'd raise his hand, he increased the size of the hands natural size, they were rather larger. They'd race upward from below Kilm attempting to bind his feet. Maybe this would keep him idle, unable to fly? * - Wed Oct 21 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) 'Water Style..Tethys's technique." the teen thought cooly, no it wasn't the clones he performed that worried the teen..It was the technique Tethys utilized, that god damn wave of water. Kilm intrigued the manipulator, he actually would've enjoyed giving him a taste of his actual power, but decided agaisnt this action. 

Another portion of the iron sand, a large amount of it formed a dense wall attempting to hold large gathering of water at bay. He had to react fast, iron sand erupted from his gourd, it quickly flowed to his feet forming a dense platform of the material. Utilizing this material of iron sand, he'd fly upward attempting to avoid the attack. If he'd been caught up with it, he wouldn't have a choice but to use that technique.* - Wed Oct 21 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "This..is becoming a drag. I'm too handicapped.." The teen thought, while the sticky syrup of water mixed in with the large amount of sand below. That would cripple him, then another spewed amount of the syrup were aimed for him. Iron sand materialized out of thin air, it wrapped the teen up in a dome of iron sand while he flew upward. 

Everything around the teen, well outside of the dome of iron sand was inhabited by flammable gas. It was like the burning ash technique, though it probably wasn't. He'd sit tight in the dome waiting while it skyrocketed upward away from Kilm's attack and his syrup.* - Wed Oct 21 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'm limited.. If I use any of my other techniques, i'll kill him..*sigh* - Wed Oct 21 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stopped mid air, the shield of sand crumbling away."Oh.. all right, see ya!" was heard from the teen as he waved at Kilm. Though, a large portion of his sand was now useless to him, "I'll have to make more.." the teen mumbled, the platform slowly decended until he arrived at Madelyn's side."Hey you." was heard from the manipulator as the sand utilized in the platform flowed back into his gourd, a cork of iron sand materialized out of thin air before it was placed at the top of his gourd.* - Wed Oct 21 20:12:35 2015

"Mhmm.." was heard from the teen, before entering he'd send a messenger bird with a letter to the Inn keepers, just a note to return the little bit of his belongings to his new address. After this he'd walk inside behind of Madelyn, just like before he was estatic, it was a small but lovely home, the size didn't matter to him.

Madelyn jumped towards him, instrinctively his arms wrapped around her to support her while holding her up. Her arms wrapped around his neck, her legs wrapped around his waist. He stared into her eyes while saying, "Do I like it?..No I don't..Honestly..I LOVE IT!" it was his second home in forever. Her weight he didn't mind, it wasn't much.* - Thu Oct 22 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) leaned in to return the kiss, romanticly his lips matched with hers. She'd pull away escaping from his grasp, she'd lay down on their bed.

I'll need those eyes of his to keep track of the bird as we travel." after saying this, the iron cork from his gourd slackened, it fell to the ground allowing for the blackened sand within, iron sand. To flow out of it, the steady flow of sand split off into two sections, the two split up sections divided between himself and Koji.
