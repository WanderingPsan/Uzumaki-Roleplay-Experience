<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I remember him. - Sat Dec 12 18:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) continued to scout causiously through the limited halls, "This is an hindrance." the man complained beneath his breath, as something dashed across the corner his eyes picked it up. He'd back up a bit causious, worried even. As the individual stopped, he'd released a sigh since he'd met Menma before. "I have no choice, its best I make this quick."

The hall was limited for a lot of movement, it was a hindrance, yet it could work in his favor. The masked man had a rather large gourd present on his back. "Please forgive me." he'd thought, at this moment the cork from his gourd erupted skyward, followed by a large amount of iron sand. He'd made a hand gesture, prompting the sand to harden into minuscule grains, these grains of sand were formed into neddles to attack simultaneously across a vast range, mainly forward at Menma, it was ideal with limited places to avoid this, and how fast the grains of sand were moving. The fast moving bullets raced forward for Menma, attempting to end it right there.* - Sat Dec 12 18:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) "There is someone.. Hmm... He has a blade it seems... This isn't good. Can't get close... then.. I'll do this." he'd thought, every step of the plan he had in mind playing out in his mind. Plus, this worked out since he was faced the other way, oblivious to his existence, for now at least. "This'll take a while, but it doesn't matter. Its a narrow passage, though... It may back fire on me as well."

So  many thoughts rushed through his mind, slowly the iron cork on his gourd slackend. Removed, a large amount of iron sand slithered out of his gourd, the sand flowed outward, filling the air, and the ground infront of the masked man. He had to changed the terrain to his own advantage, plus he wasn't sure of the apparent swordman's ability, he could've had keen hearing for all he knew, or he could've been a clone.* - Sat Dec 12 20:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: (This area, is filled with sand) - Sun Dec 13 01:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) wasn't a sensor in the slightest, the mask man had a rather large sized gourd on his back. His hands at his side while scouting the area, his left eye remained on the world around him. His heart dropped slightly seeing the state in which Kami was in, he felt sorry, but then again he was a bit paranoid, it could've been a trap.

The entire pathway, the passage was filled with Blackened Sand. Originally, he was aiming for the swordman a little ways of here, but he hauled ass. He'd raise his left hand, forming a hand gesture. Reacting to the hand gesture, the very sand benath his feet formed into two hands that attempted to clutch on to Kami's feet, binding him where he was in place."What happened to you?" the masked man asked, he tried to be aware of his surroundings, incase there was a potential ambush.* - Sun Dec 13 01:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) released a low tired sigh, the state that Kami was in wasn't the best.. He didn't want to kill him, but he wouldn't be able to pass this test if he didn't kill a couple of people down the road.."Its to better the village." he'd mumble below his breath, he'd refocus on Kami his eyes locked on his figure."I'm sorry, I have some people I have to protect.." his words sounded heavy, his left hand rose upward pointed at Kami's chest. Reacting to this, the sand at Kami's feet raced up along his body, as if clawing away at it, consuming his entire body in Iron sand.

"..I have to survive this for Hayate.." he'd mumbled beneath his breath, he'd closed his open palm. Chakra raced through out the iron coffin of sand, the coffin that binded him grew tighter, squeezing him. But he'd make it quick, he didn't want to make the guy suffer, nore did his heart want this. Closing his hand quicker, pressure rushed through out the enitity of it, the sand imploded from the pressure hopefully killing Kami without much pain felt as the Shinobi crossed over to the next world. Life energy, or blood scattered about mixed in with the imploded sand, hopefully liquefied Kami completely....* - Sun Dec 13 01:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: .... - Sun Dec 13 01:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I have enough ghosts haunting me... - Sun Dec 13 01:33:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Gramps, did you have to go through this? - Sun Dec 13 01:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) with one head under his belt, he brought two fingers up to the right side of his mask channeling chakra. An eye made of the material that littered the ground formed, it was connected to his right eye. Like that, the eye was sent off, to search the cave for others he had to kill.* - Sun Dec 13 01:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) continued to scout the area for unsuspecting shinobi that remained, so far all he'd captured with his eye, was a grusome sight. Blood, bodies, people using the last of their actions to either flee but failed, or begging for their lives.. Everything he witnessed from his eye, it left a bat taste in his mouth. Did he really have to do this? He didn't want to continue the blood shed, on another note Shukaku was having a ball with so much blood shed in one day, it made Tetsumi shiver slightly.

His eyes widned, from the position of his eye and the winding passage ways, someone was approaching his position. This.. He couldn't allow them to pin point him, not at all. The eye remained on the ceiling, monitoring the buffed shinobi's movements. "I'll have to take him out quick, before he leaves a trail.." he'd raised his hand, iron sand materialized above of the buff shinobi's head. At this time, he'd been into the shock of his life. He wasn't paying attention behind of him. A shinobi, he wasn't muscular, he looked pathetic in stature when compared to the others. "I'll have to deal with that, time to set a trap." with this in mind, the iron sand around the area flowed into his gourd, the man jogged through the passage, dashing through many of the winding passage ways. 

He'd stumble across an open area, it was dark not well lit at all."Not good.. I'm open." he heard faint foot steps but couldn't pint point them. His sights were still on the muscular shinobi in the sight of his iron sand eye. "W-" before the masked teen could've reacted due to he poor lighting something moved at a fast pace through the darkness. Sand erupted from the gourd on his back, forming a solid wall out in front of the masked man.  Someone was there, but he couldn't pin point whomever they were. 

Yet another attempt to strike him down was made, his sand moved on its own, protecting Tetsumi."Not good... Can't pin point them." he couldn't react, he had to abandon his sights of the musular shinobi from before. From all sides, something wizzed through the air, cutting through the faint wind currents passing through the cave. His sand formed a dome around him, "Now.. its time to act."

Most likely, there were more than one shinobi acting together. Why would they focus on him? A weak smile formed on his lips beneath his mask on coming up with the answer for this, "Pick off the strong. Good tactic." he'd clasped his hands, iron sand at his feet formed into an identical clone of himself made out of the iron sand. Following this, both of his hands moved downward at the ground. Iron sand swirled around his palm, forming into a large drill that dug through the earth. Leaving an opening, that was soon close off. The clone was the only thing that remained.

At this point, they attacked once more with many techniques, and ninja tools. The shield had given up, a line formed in the middle, that stretched along the durable mass. But what broke through, were earth spikes conjured by one of the shinobi. The spikes torn straight through the shield, piercing the clone directly in the chest. Its eye widened wildly as it fell on to the ground, with the clone down, the dimmed lights fadded away as light returned. The clone groaned on the ground, witnessing the scene with his sand eye, it looked to be about eight shinobi in total. 

"This'll be an issue, either way.. They're in the palm of my hand." they neared the clone, gloating. Though, it seemed as if the group of allied shinobi had a dispute of whom would finish the clone off. Tetsumi would take full advantage of this, he'd made a couple of hand gesture, from the iron sand littered about above, the sand branced off hardening, forming into minuscule grains of sand that were shaped into neddles.  These neddles were sent forward, at alarming speeds, simply by using the repelant force of magnetism. The shinobi were alarmed, six were impaled, the neddles piercing straight through their bodies at vital areas. While the earth shinobi from before used a wall of earth to defend.

The masked man smiled, while the earth shinobi felt 'safe' his sand went around the shield right away, clutching at his legs in the form of hands."G'otcha." he'd thought while continuing the binding process. The sand clawed at his being, consuming him, as well as any downed shinobi on the ground, groaning or bearly alive nearing death from the surprise attack. Each one, was encased in the coffin that repesented death, both of his hands were extended outward opened. Closing them, chakra ran through out the sand, pressure was followed by this it squeezed at the shinobi. Each of their screams were heard for a second, a second before the sand imploded, each one was liquified, life escaped them. All of the eight shinobi were killed, with this wipe the side of his face.

Behind of his mask, he looked sad.. Kami words, the first life he'd taken during the Gezo exam resonated in his mind. "Remember this in the future, the face of the man you killed who was helpless so that you could become a political figure, so that you could be connected by the corruption of Gezo. Remember it well and let it haunt you, boy.", he'd released a heavy sigh. Kami's words did manage to haunt him, even in a short time as this. 

The mask man shook off Kami's words, crawling out of the hole he'd turn begin to walk away.. He had to leave the area, it was too pongent of death, it'd bring more problems for him, more shinobi that wanted his head in able to pass. All of a sudden, their was a blur behind of him. His sand reacted quickly, defending him yes, but it was easily torn through. An elbow aimed for the back of the masked man's head. Knowing where the attack was coming from, and that there was indeed an attack coated his body in iron sand, his last defense.

On contact, the armor cracked, chipping away his body thrown through the air from the recoil. A groan of pain and surprise was heard from the man, as he rolled across the floor he'd glanced at the same man... the same muscular man he'd seen in his eye before, the one he neglected beforehand. The man drew a blade, rotating it in a circle. He was mesmerized by this, this was when the genjutsu was induced, this was the trigger. The man's body split into ten of himself, as he moved after images were left in his wake.

The muscular man appeared behind of Tetsumi, his blade drawn, aimed for his neck in a quick swipe. His body stun by the genjutsu. Shukaku's voice echo'd through out his mind, while channeling chakra to restart to flow of chakra within Tetsumi's body."Behind you, Kill him fool!" but was it too late? His vision cleared, the gourd on his back broke down, forming into a shield. His eyes widened wildly behind of his mask, he'd extended his fingers forward spikes were formed out of the shield, a total of four spikes that branced out, piercing straight through the sword man's body. The spikes continued through him, extending uptward like a brance. 

"H-How could y-.." flat line, his sword left his grasp, blood dripped down the sand and on to the floor staining the area in more blood."That's my last kill." with that he'd wait sit on the floor, his legs crossed, his eyes closed while he waited for the Gezo examiner to recall him, he'd done what he needed to do.* - Sun Dec 13 03:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) brought his right hand up towards his right eye, channeling chakra iron sand matterialized above of his head. It was the right amount of sand required for the form he'd have in mind. The sand formed into a bird, one of the many small birds around konoha. He'd wisk his hand away, sending the bird through the skies, its wings flapping, it was off to do its job. While the armored individual stayed hidden from his true position.* - Sun Dec 13 17:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) watched from the bird's sight, he'd picked up a couple of people, especially around the Hokage's office. There seemed to be a cluster of people present there, raising his hand iron sand materialized within the air near to the hokage's mansion. From there, the clone was crafted into an identical clone of himself, chizzled into perfection. The clone walked up the path, its head going from left to right, as if taking a mental note of the people gathered there.* - Sun Dec 13 18:11:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) was speechless as the beast was released.. His body trembled a little, a little of fright, mixed in with excitement. The excitement came out of nowhere, his stomach tightened up a bit as if Shukaku wanted a piece of the seven tails. As quickly as the beast emerged, it attacked, it swung its tail whipping up large amount of debris. Reacting quickly, he'd clapped his hands forcefully. A loud crackling sound was produced as Iron sand erupted from the masked man's gourd. 

The sand sped into life, forming a gigantic dome of iron sand around the three, hopefully protecting them from the debree, as well as keeping them all together. While focusing on keeping the beast's attack form smashng through his defenses he'd spit out a couple words to the two."I'll attack and try to defend from far, you two get in.. You're taijutsu users, right? If I can, I'll try to restrict its movements..!"

If his shield did faulter, or attempt to break his sand moved on its own at a fast pace to repair it. "Now... we'll leave this here as diversion, while we attack from another position from below.. and submerge elsewhere." Saying this, more sand erupted from his gourd, his hands focused on the ground sand swirling around his hands, digging away at the flooring below, wood was chipped away forming a hole for the two to escape into. At this time, three figures of iron sand emerged, one identical to the masked man, Geo, and Shiro. They were placeholders, for when the shield gave out. 

Hopefully,they could attack from another location before the beast realized... If possible.* - Sun Dec 13 20:18:30 2015
