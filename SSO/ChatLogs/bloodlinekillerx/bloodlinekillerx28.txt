<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) whispers: (it is but that wont matter. XD its not being used normally as others migh tuse the jutsu) - Mon Nov  9 20:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Those hand seals.." the teen observed the seals that Hanae formed, he knew them. They were the handseals for the Mist Servant technique, which meant they were most likely genjutsu.. He couldn't hurt them, the more he even tried to attack the clones, they'd multiply."You sly little..." the teen mumbled, there were two clones behind of him, one clone taking Hanae's place while the real Hanae was above.

"I guess if you want to play like that.." a smirk was visible on the teen's face." Clasping his hands, he gathered chakra. While he did this, he thought up of a strategy, as well as going along with it for Hanae's sake. The gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field. The iron cork on the teen's gourd flew off of his gourd, blackened sand erupted from the teen's gourd. As it was released, the expelled sand morphed into ten shuriken each. 

Four shuriken were sent behind of him, two for each clone behind. While a total of six shuriken raced forward. As the shuriken raced forward, Tetsumi clasped his hands together. Once formed, he'd inhale oxygen from the air around him while churnning wind natured chakra inside of him. The chakra multiplied inside of him, parting his lips he'd blow outward releasing a powerful gale of wind towards the shuriken made of iron sand. In mixing these two, he'd increase the weapon's speed, and sharpness making it a little more deadly. Plus, they were manipulated each of the six imbued with wind natured chakra. Two of the wind infused shuriken were aimed for the hanae on the ground, the others banked upward at a fast pace aiming to impale Hanae at her mid-section. 

If his hunch was right, maybe this'd stop the technique and he'd win? If not, he'd be horribly wrong and he'd lose some cash.* - Mon Nov  9 20:19:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) didn't want to be followed nore bothered by a group of people. So, he'd do something that probably made the situation look worse than it actually was. He'd made a sudden handgesture, the iron cork at the top of the teen's gourd flew off. Blackened sand flowed out of the gourd, section of the went towards his and Mizora's own feet, while another section of sand flowed underneath Chikyu's feet. 

The sand became dense, dense enough to support each of their specific weight. With a flick of his wrist, the two platforms lifted off of the sand, soaring off to where ever Jiki wished."Ha, can't follow me now." he'd thought in his mind.* - Tue Nov 10 02:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked down from above, "This seems like a nice spot." he'd occasionally look back, mainly checking up on Chikyu since she seemed.. shaken up by the experience of flying. The both platforms of iron slowly decended from the sky above until landing about north east of the village. 

Though, as a safe guard incase Shira or anyone else followed him. He'd make a... detour? For them. As the platform landed, he'd brought two fingers up to his left eye channeling chakra. Out of thin air iron sand formed, the sand formed into an ordinary bird. The bird took flight, flying high. While locating Shira, he'd make three clones off in the distance, right in time for him to stumble on to them.

Iron sand materialized in the distance, three individuals formed out of the sand. One resembled Tetsumi himself, while the other two resembled both Mizora, and Chikyu. Everything look identical. "This'll keep him away." the teen thought while keeping tabs with his unique third eye technique.* - Tue Nov 10 02:42:59 2015

//The clone spoke up, "Oh?.. really..." a smile formed on the clone's lips before it suddenly erupted into iron sand. Followed by the other clones as well, as that happened each section of sand raced forward for Shira's body. If allowed to get near, he'd execute the next step. If the sand even came into contact with Shira's body, the sand would latch on to him mercilessly until he was consumed in iron sand up to his neck.

A loner like mysef have spoken enough nonesense words." from Shira's location, the sand crumbled off of his being, releasing him. The sand then flowed off into the air, venturing else where. The sand used in the third eye technique, that to broke down and traveled back to the original. Once returned, every grain of the material, it flowed back into his gourd. The iron crok was formed and placed soon after, sealing off the gourd for later use.

"Only one seal.. easy enough, though it may be a little challenging.."* - Tue Nov 10 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) palced the scroll down on his lap, his eyes went from the scroll, his mind went over the information obtain so far."Mhmm.. Multiply bullets.. I can do it." he'd brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body, there he formed a single seal. With the execution of the bird seal he'd inhaled air, within himself he churnned wind styled chakra as he inhale. The chakra multiplied, brances off, forming seperate bullets of compressed air within himself.

"Maybe.. This is enough?" he wasn't sure if it were or, parting his lips he'd blow outward. Releasing two bullets of compressed air, though the bullets of air quickly dispersed. They didn't hold true to their form. "Mhmm.. Tighter, more compressed.."* - Tue Nov 10 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) hands went towards the scroll after, his pointer finger brushing along the lines of it. Going over the instructions it gave him, he just needed to follow each step. His hands went from the scroll to the mid-section of his body, there he formed a single seal. With the bird seal executed, Tetsumi reeled in air filling his lungs with oxygen. Within himself, wind natured chakra churrnned, multiplying and branching off in the process. Each section of wind was branched off within himself, compressing into individual bullets of wind. 

Parting his lips, he'd release a succession of multiple bullets. The bullets were swift, smashing into a wall in the distance, sand and debree of stone was kicked about. "Woah." the teen was impressed with his growth, especially with the technique. * - Tue Nov 10 04:37:20 2015
