<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) platform of iron sand slowly rose into the air before leaving, he didn't care to talk any longer. There efforts were a waste, especially to find one lowly Genin. It annoyed him, especially since he tried so hard to protect and preserve his life. Now, it was out of his hands. What may have happened after Mokutsu was caught, it no longer was in his hands.* - Thu Oct 22 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "You..caught him.." the teen scratched the back of his head. If he was that individual known as 'Dark' he had an idea it was him. He just hoped he'd gotten away, especially since he knew it'd be difficult for him especially as a jinchuriki. The teen sighed, he already had another execution assignment set in about three hours tops. A sigh escaped the teen's figure, "Great work, Marrisa. What happened exactly?" 

His orders were final, he tried to bargain in exchange for Mokutsu's life in truth but it didn't fly..He only tried to put up a tough act for his squad he had to lead, inside he was hurting..."Escourt him this way..Marrisa." was heard from the teen, they were headed towards the execution grounds of sunagakure. It was high above the village, where Mokutsu could've been used as an example. 

He'd be tied to a rotten husk of a tree, it was decayed or close to completely decaying. He'd look at the sky, it was slowly retreating from the sky above night was approaching. "Mokutsu..Mokutsu why?" the Jounin's voice was emotional, almost close to breaking. He cared for a lot of things in truth, especially another jinchuriki since the last he'd gotten close to was deceased.

After what ever Mokutsu would've said, his grace period for his final words were over. The iron cork from his gourd slackened, it was removed it slowly made its  decent towards to the sand below. It was as if time moved in slow motion, the sand from his gourd flowed out of it. It began at his feet, slowly making its way up until it consumed every inch of his body, it stopped at his neck."I-I'm..I'm sorry.." tears were visible welling up in his eyes, it was the saddness he felt for another jinchuriki, from another vessel of a beast to another. The last bit of the sand convered his entier body, his left hand was held out his palm visible aiming at the coffin of iron sand.

He'd close his eyes, the tears flowing from his eye sockets, at this exact moment he closd his palm shutting it tight. Chakra coursed through out the coffin of sand, signalling a strong amount of chakra to travel through it in an attempt to end the jinchuriki's life quickly instead of a slow painful one. It would be quick and swift, hopefully enough force to cause him less pain before he departed from this world..it was a cruel world. Blood mixed in with sand erupted about, it was scattered in various locations. The villagers would see this, as well as shinobi that ever thought of disobeying sunagakure and trying to go rouge, this would be their fate.

Apart of him..it died a little. He swared he'd protect his fellow jinchuriki, but it was all in vain..Mokutsu was dead and the teen was in pain, it felt as if someone carved out a large portion of his heart, by passing his shield of sand and managing such a feat. "...This world... of... shinobi, I shall change it." the teen said between sobs.* - Thu Oct 22 08:38:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) pokes Madelyn in her side, "What about now? I don't know any good vacation type of spots..but..I guess we could try?" he tried to make a suggestion about the matter.* - Fri Oct 23 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: Sure, let's go!~ - Fri Oct 23 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) slowly rose from the ground while lifting Madelyn, he'd be holding his lover in his arms. The iron cork from his gourd slackened before it was removed from the gourd, as it made its decent towards the sand below, iron sand flowed out of the gourd. This flow of blackened sand gathered beneath their feet, it'd become dense until it could support their added weight. The platform slowly rose into the air, their destination he hadn't the slightest idea, though the intent was to find a good vacationing spot for the two.

"Mhmm...Wonder what's a head, heh." the teen thought as he sped through the skies while holding Madelyn in his arms, his eyes looked into hers. It was the best feeling he'd felt, it even rivaled losing his virginity but the moment was truely special for him.* - Fri Oct 23 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) soared through the sky alongside Madelyn, he'd divert his attention from her eyes for the time being. He had to focus a head of him, for miles on miles, there was nothing but sand. Couple earthern formation like, the coal mines, or where he'd go outside of the village to meditate. "Where.." the teen mumbled beneath his breath, his eyes moving from the left to the right where analyzing the terrain below and a head of him.

"Maybe I won't find anythin'.." he'd thought while soaring through the skies with the aid of his platform of iron sand. Up a head, there was a a rocky terrain formed in a circle as if inclosing something within. He'd fly over it, inside there was a water source. "Mhmm?.." the platform of iron slowly decended from the skies above, below it became more visible. It painted a clearer more vivid picture for the teen's eyes. The water below glistened in the sunagakure sun, the rocky terrain worked around it inclosing the water source. 

"Great!" the teen allowed this thought to escape from his mind, he'd land on the rocky surface, there was a path down to the water source like a dip in the path winding down to it. He'd lower Madelyn to her feet, for one he was tired of holding her not mentally but physically. Instead he'd hold her hand while ushering her towards the water source, "Is this what you had in mind?" the teen questioned while taking in the beauty of the natural made swimming area.* - Fri Oct 23 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: Mhmm..Well..Maybe we could come back here..and actually test the water, ehehe. - Fri Oct 23 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) whispers: I didn't bring a bathing suit. - Fri Oct 23 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: *face turned red* Well..Maybe the next time you will...heh.. - Fri Oct 23 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) whispers: Pffft.~ I didn't know we were coming here!~ - Fri Oct 23 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: Ehehe, no excuses. You wanted a vacation, haha. - Fri Oct 23 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Though honestly, I didn't know either.. - Fri Oct 23 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Convient ain't it...*high5's self* - Fri Oct 23 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Ehh..well.." face turned bright red as Madelyn stripped down to her panties and bra."True..I guess its only us after all." the teen mumbled, he'd removed his gourd, chuunin vest, clothing underneath, shoes, everything until he was down to his boxers. He'd hold Madelyn's hands while escourting her over to the water.* - Fri Oct 23 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: So..Beautiful..Nope..Suppress the urge Jiki.. - Fri Oct 23 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Soo..Beautiful..Resist the urge Jiki.. - Fri Oct 23 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "C-Cold.." the teen's teeth chattered a bit, despite its look, the sun reflecting off of it, the sheen the rays from above gave it..The water was cold, he'd tip toe inside his body close to retreating at this point. While stuck between these thoughts, Madelyn took the opportunity to splash the teen. His body froze on him, a smile formed on his lips."OH! You want to fight, ALL RIGHT!" the teen roared, he'd attempt to splash Madelyn back while trying to make his way over to her.* - Fri Oct 23 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shielded himself as more water splashed him, some even got into his eyes blinded him for a moment."HEY!!!" he'd use one hand to wipe his eyes clean, revealing to him Madelyn's nipples. His face turned pink but this slowly left his face as more cold water washed over him, he'd begin to splash some more water in Madelyn's direction mainly focused towards her eyes.

This in when he'd make his move, the teen dived into the water. He hoped to swim around Madelyn while she was blinded and resurface behind if. If sucessful he'd grab a hold of her, mainly focused to hold her around the stomach area."G'otcha!"* - Fri Oct 23 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) smiled as Madelyn turned around to face him, her arms were around his neck there wasn't any doubt about it he'd be pulled in for a kiss. He'd lean in as well, his lips dancing along hers as the two kissed passionately. He'd pull away, his hands slid into her panties, he'd grab her butt messaging it suductively.* - Fri Oct 23 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) leaned in for yet another kiss, pulling away he'd whisper in his lover's ear"Oh? It does? The teen questioned, at this same time her fingers ran up and down his chest. It sent chills down his spine, not bad ones it was a good feeling for him. His friend below came to life, to an extent despite the cold water he'd raise from the depths. * - Fri Oct 23 03:38:27 2015
