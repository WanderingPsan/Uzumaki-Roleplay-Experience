<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) wasn't aware of Rias's action or attempted action. His body was moving forward, he was intent on leaving the area. Then, all of a sudden.. A chill ran through his body, his body tensed, his movements stopped. 

As Rias entered his mind, the Tanuki decided to take it upon himself this time.. This was the second time the dumb bitch tried to enter -his- vessel as he liked to refer towards Tetsumi's body. Rias was brought before the tanuki, he'd scold the female from his ancient word lettering prison."WHAT THE FUCK DID I TELL?!" he was refering to the last time she tried to enter Tetsumi's mind, sand swirled around Rias's body within Tetsumi's mind.  The sand attempted to bind her, it moved swift and fast subdoing her rather easily."DIE!: the beast brought his fingers together closing his arm. It seemed like she was perish, but this wasn't the case. He was basically kicking her out by scaring her shit less.

As quickly as Rias entered, she'd be expelled and Tetsumi regained full control of his mind and body. As she left, Tetsumi reopened his eyes to the tanuki's figure. He was back here again, "What?" he'd ask, he could've seen how pissed the Tanuki was. It was written all over his face."Wait.. did she c-Oh no."

//Shukaku interupted him, screaming at him too!"OH YES, I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD TOO! WHY THE HELL, YOU FUCKING WEAK SHIT! I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD!"

//Tetsumi sighed, he'd scratch behind of his head nervously."Yoo.. I'm sorry Shukaku. I.. wait.. So what happened to her?" he'd ask sounding a little concerned, he knew how blood thirsty shukaku truely was, he knew that first hand.

//Shukaku"GET OUT!" he'd kick Tetsumi out as well, his golden prison vanishing from the teen's sight.

//Tetsumi reopened his eyes, the world around him came back into focus. He'd turn back around to glare at Rias whom intruded his mind for the second time. He wanted to kill her. Why? Because she knew his secret, that couldn't fly. If people knew whom or what truely was inside him... But he'd remain quiet, releasing a sigh from within he'd attempt to continue to leave.* - Fri Nov 13 04:53:07 2015

So you know that much, huh?" this wasn't good for him, especially since she was a konoha shinobi. Which meant, she'd probably known it destroyed konoha before. This made his situation a lot worse, as Rias neared him, her body was pressed against his own."What?.." he'd thought while looking into her fearful eyes.* - Fri Nov 13 09:27:53 2015

"What?.." he'd question, his stare holding loneliness and range. Though, just staring into Rias's eyes.. He could see she truely wanted to help him, he didn't understand it. His gaze softened with every word she spoke, releasing a sigh he'd look into Rias's eyes."I can't make any promises, but... I'll allow you to... help." saying this he'd look away from Rias as she continued to hug him.* - Fri Nov 13 09:55:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) thinks: heh. - Sat Nov 14 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued towards the toilet, once there he'd lift up the top lid of the toilet followed by the seat. Once done, he'd unbuckle his belt partially allowing his pants to drop a little. He'd pull down his boxer a little, allowing for his friend below to dangle freely. Alligning with the needed angle, he'd release a yellow liquid from the hold located at the head of his penis. "Ahhhh..." he'd say feeling relieved, he couldn't hold it any longer.* - Sat Nov 14 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: my rp*_ - Sat Nov 14 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) flow of yellowish liquid stopped, the flow of pee from his penis came to a hault. He'd shake the head a little before pulling back up his boxer and pants, once done he'd flush the toilet and proceed over towards the sink.

If allowed to get that far, he'd squeeze soap into his hand, rup it together in his hands. Turning on the water, he'd carefully wash his hands properly. Finished with these steps, he'd reach for a paper towel drying his hands."Sorry to interrupt your showering Sis." he'd apologize before attempting to walk out of the room.* - Sat Nov 14 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stopped at the door, "What th-...That doesn't sound like Izanami's voice." he'd thought while turning completely around. He'd focus on the shower, the water continued to run."Who's in there?" he'd ask while advancing over towards the stall.* - Sat Nov 14 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) didn't hear an answer, maybe it was muffled by the water? His defenses were up, he was prepared for a potential ambush. His left hand pressed against the door to the shower, pushing it open he'd attempt to enter.* - Sat Nov 14 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) body froze up the moment he entered the shower, it was at the exact moment Midora replied... "OH SHIT!" he'd exclaim after witnessing the nakid female. He'd stumble backwards, he felt as if he disrestpected the female by waltzing in on her. Thinking back on what he'd saw... that was the first nakid female he'd ever seen in his life.* - Sat Nov 14 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) says: Why're you reacting so wildly? - Sat Nov 14 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Uhh.... - Sat Nov 14 03:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) says: Haha. - Sat Nov 14 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) pink blotches, coloration was visible on the teen's face.. It progressed to a red color, his face burned bright and hot as she twirled nakid. He tried to speak but nothing came out, he couldn't help himself. His eyes analyzed the female from head to toe, taking into account her feminine attributes.* - Sat Nov 14 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *gulp* - Sat Nov 14 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) staggered backwards until coming to a sudden stop at the wall behind of him."Wha?..." this made the teen even hotter than before, if Midora continued forward she'd easily be able to embrace him. The female was soaking wet and nakid, he felt her wet body against his own. His clothes were being dampened a little due to her body. His face was red, his hands slowly wrapped around Midora's body returning the embrace.* - Sat Nov 14 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stared into Midora's eyes, she tip toed her body almost off of the ground.. Her lips were nearing his, it felt like a couple minutes passed as if time slowed down. For a moment he invsioned someone else, reacting off of this he'd lower his hed coming in for a passionate kiss on Midora's own. His lips danced with hers, he tried to be in complete synch with her own.* - Sat Nov 14 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) heart rate increased, this feeling he didn't expect. Though it was a mixture of lust, and lonliness... He wanted something to fill that, a weird sensation flowed through his body. As he pulled away from the kiss, he'd stare into Midora's eyes. He couldn't hold it back any longer, he tried to but couldn't. Blood flowed to his penis, increasing its size a little. The buldge probably poked Midora in her stomach, though this time he wasn't as embrassed as the last time this happened. He wanted her, well the feeling he'd gotten out of this.* - Sat Nov 14 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) body twitched a little as her fingers moved along the buldge in his pants, in actuality this was the head of the teen's penis. He'd gulp a little, everything about this situation turned the teen on tremendously. A slight smile was visible on the teen's face as Midora spoke. "Maybe.. Maybe it has." he'd return the same words, his right hand motioned towards her ass while saying this.* - Sat Nov 14 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: This is... - Sat Nov 14 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) buldge increased in a size a little more, Midora's moaning turned the teen on more. Her body pressed against his, her fingers fumbling along the shaft of his penis that was covered in clothing. Hand moved on its own, it by passed her ass, banking a little to allign with her vagina. His index finger extended outward, his rub this finger against her clit messaging the area. He'd try to return the pleasure while she fumbled around with the shaft of his penis.* - Sat Nov 14 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) winched a little as Midora's hand slid into his pants, he felt her fingers around his shaft, it felt different. Her hand felt cold, his penis twitched a little in her grasp. "O-Oh yeeahhh?..." it was difficult for the teen to keep the smirk on his face, it quivered a little trying to keep together. His finger at this moment took its first plunge into Midora's vagina. At first, the pace that he fingered the teen was slow, though he'd increase its pace while bending his index finger at an angle when inserted.* - Sat Nov 14 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) smiled as Midora seemed to have lost, her fingers slipped away from the shaft of his erected penis. Her head was thrown back a little, with her head coming back forward her chin was placed on his chest. He continued to finger the female, speeding up the rate in which he fingered Midora coating his index finger in her love juices. With his free hand, he'd support her nakid body that was pressed against his own body.

Though, to ensure that he'd win he'd draw another finger into the battlefield. Two fingers were submerged into Midora's vagina at the same time, each one once submerged bent a little feeling her insides even better than the last. Her vagina felt as if it was hugging his fingers, the juices produced by Midora mid it easier to prood further. * - Sat Nov 14 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to finger Midora until she orgasmed, he'd felt his fingers washed over with even more juices than usual. The juices expelled from her vagina dripped on to the floor, this turned the teen on even greeter.. The buldge in his pants increased in size once more, it was more aparent poking out of his pants.  Once she came, he'd remove his fingers from her vagina.

"Woah.." he'd look at his two fingers, hell even his own hand was coated in Midora's love juices.* - Sat Nov 14 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) wrapped his arms around Midora's body as she did to him, he'd hold her close."Hmm.. I think I over did it." he'd mumble while glancing at the female.* - Sat Nov 14 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) says: I'm sleepy.. - Sat Nov 14 05:48:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) blinked twice as Midora fell asleep. "Geez... She peed on me, then went to sleep? *sigh* Females.." mumbling this, he'd slowly drag her sleeping body out of the bathroom. Grabbing a towel, he'd keep that in his other arm. He'd slowly and causiously place her on the bed and wrap her body in the towel for warmth, as well as drying off her body. 

After this, he'd put the sheet over her body about up to her neck."Sleep easy." he'd leave the sleeping Midora with these words while attempting to leave the scene.* - Sat Nov 14 05:52:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) wasn't really paying much attention to Rias in all honestly, while Lera spoke about 'bijuu' he'd think about Shukaku. He didn't know the term 'bijuu' but now he knew what others refered his kind as, despite this he'd still call the tanuki by his name. To him, even beasts deserved to be called by their true name, hell he even understod how it felt to not be called by his real name.. The village did refer to him as a monster, even to this day, it sucked.

While deep in thought he'd suddenly snap out of it as Rias grabbed a hold of his hand."Hmm?" he'd look to the right of him noticing Rias, though he didn't make a scene about his hand being grabbed he'd simply return the gesture and hold her own hand tightly in his own. His own fingers interwining with her own, he'd release a sigh.* - Sat Nov 14 07:38:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You holding any other chuunin exams in the near future? - Sat Nov 14 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) appeared at the gate in a swirl of blackened sand, his hands were tucked into his pockets as he cut through the many guards at the gate. Each guard moving to the side as the Jounin cut through the crowd in his attempt to get to the front of gate. He'd notice Hatsujin, an eyebrow raised."What's your reason for coming here?" he'd ask while taking into account everything about Hatsujin in mental notes.* - Sat Nov 14 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Hmm... A traveling muscian?" he'd look him over taking note of the head of his guitar. "What's your reason for coming here? Are you willing to pay the fee, of even staying here at our Inn?" he'd ask while eyeing down the muscian over again.* - Sat Nov 14 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Maybe he has money? - Sat Nov 14 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) scratched the back of his neck nervously, "Hmm.. He doesn't seem like he'll cause problems." the teen thought while looking over the muscian over once more. His hand that scratched the back of his neck made a hand gesture, this hand gesture only meant a specific signal or command to the guards. 

The guards once seeing said signal parted for the muscian to enter, as the muscian entered he'd follow behind of him. From there he'd take the traveling bum to Hassan to discuss his staying fee.* - Sat Nov 14 21:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Well this is interesting. - Sat Nov 14 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Greetings, you three. - Sat Nov 14 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stopped in his tracks, he'd turn completely around the moment Ryuu's voice was heard behind of the two. "Stop musician, Let me handle this real quick." saying this he'd slowly walk back towards the gate.. The guards at the gate, parted to the side once more allowing Tetsumi to pass through with ease.

"What's your reason for coming here?" he'd ask, his hands to his side this time around.* - Sat Nov 14 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: That is all I am here for, nothing else. You have my word. - Sat Nov 14 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) felt a little as easy, "A blacksmith? That's all? Understandable." he'd made yet again another hand gesture, the guards read the signal the Jounin made. With the command being given, each guard moved to the side parting the way for Ryuu the blacksmith to enter.

"Hurry up." he'd realy to the blacksmith, as he passed himself he'd follow behind both the blacksmith and the muscian. He'd just follow behind the two until they arrived at the village's square. * - Sat Nov 14 22:06:04 2015
