<br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //the girl decided this was it, this was her faith death at the hands of these goons. "The sky, I can at least look at it once more." she'd take a last glance above, at this time she'd notice the weapons raining down from the heavens, something was above floating defying gravity and probably controling these objects? Though her defeated expression turned into greater fear, it was one of those manipulators that killed her family..

//Goons, "OH! You're afraid now aren't cha'? Ahaha, it'll be over soon." they drew closer, and the girl closed her eyes open to death at this point.

//Boss in the back, "Watch it! DUCK YOU FOOLS!" it warned his goons as he sliced at one of the incoming shuriken coming his way with ease.

//Masked Teen, "Its too late! HUMPH!" the teen managed to land the shuriken into the backs of the goons, it wouldn't kill them but it served its pourpose in obtaining their attention. With the paused between his next technique, more sand rained from above, it split into four blobs of sand enough to cover a large portion of the goon's body mainly their waist up to their head. There was a dealy before the final action, the masked teen expression was as blank as the mask he wore his rose two open palms and slowly clenched them increasing the force. It was unberable pressure crushing everything he could that was covered in sand, this time he wasn't sorry for killing someone this time they deserved it. Blood splitered everywhere, only their buttom half reamined their feet but it was a bonus for the critteres that dwelled in the dessert, they'd have some good eating for a change. "One left." was heard from his figure as the platform of iron lowered from above.* - Fri Oct  2 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Boss looked above at the concealed individual, he didn't seem afraid, amazed, nothing. Even though his goons were gruesomely killed, it didn't seem to faze him one bit. A light chuckle was heard from him, "I welcome battle child, c'mere!" the man's voice roared at the heavens, his hands outstretched the bloodied katana in his hand, though he'd taken a step backwards since the sand was so near. 

//Concealed teen was a bit impressed, despite him even killing his goons it didn't faze him, did it even effect him in the slightest? The platform of sand touched the sand below, as it touched it funneled back into his gourd. He'd walk closer, even passing the frightened girl laying on the sand as if she didn't exist. "Didn't their lifes even matter to you?"

//The man burst out in laughter, "You ask me these stupid quesions, aren't you a shinobi?" with that he dashed forward dashing past his captive, his feet was light and swift as if he glided across the sand itself. * - Fri Oct  2 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) "Fast..!" the concealed teen thought as the man approached, "But my sand's faster!" his hands guided the iron sand, every fiber of it rushed forward, but the man bob and weaved with the blade slicing and kept it moving. "W-Wha?.." the child thought, form the sand into spikes trible the usual size. This actually seemed to deter him, the man was knocked off of his path blood dripped from one of his legs.

//Boss Man, "Good but not good enough!" the man raced forward, to intercept this action the concealed teen formed a clone of himself out of the iron sand lined about. The clone rushed forward but was easily sliced through its core, the clone looked shocked at first but its core regenerated. All of the sand particles gathered back into place reforming the clone and also trapping the blade within. 

//Concealed teen made another hand gesture, it was time finish the man. The man in queston abandoned his blade since he couldn't pull it out and dashed forward at the teen, he seemed unguarded after all maybe this action would free his blade? As he raced forward he delievered a punch aimed at the concealed figure's face, this was easily countered. The sand move on its own, a dense wall formed infront of the masked teen defending against the threat as well as causing pain to the man...it obviously wasn't an ordinary wall. "...Hehe, you said you like battle? I really hope you were open to the end result!" with this sand raced forward, it clutched at the man's feet, hands, and legs even his head. Forcefully the sand tugged until it ripped off these limbs whole. Blood splattered, he would surely bleed to death. The teen decided this was it, their wasn't much for him to do.  * - Fri Oct  2 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) walked away from the mess he made, the blood from the various bodies soaked into the grass giving it a rich crimson color of blood. His head went from the bodies to the girl he rescued. Despite rescuing her she seemed afraid..no terrified of him. He could've seen it in her eyes, he knew that look the same terrified look the other children of sunagakure gave him back then. The same look of terror than manifested and contributed to a large number of sand manipulators as well as his grandmother meeting her end.

//Girl began crawling away in fear, "G-GET AWAY!"

The concealed teen rose his hands in the air showing that he isn't armed nore a threat."I'm not here to harm you. I-" //The Girl spoke up cutting off the concealed figure's speech."You're a witch, like those other manipulators that caused the village to suffer nothing but pain in the past, killing my parents, my home...EVERYTHING!"

Concealed teen's body shook a bit, "SHUT UP! I'm not a witch, neither none of the manipulators..It was just bad luck, sunagakure was on the wrong side of luck's coin on that day. Neither you or I can change that, what happened or the people lost.." behind of his mask, tears welled up in his eyes. In honesty he'd taken full responsibility for that day, it wasn't the beast's fault in his book..Blaming him wouldn't solve it, it wouldn't change what happened. He had to live with this, it was mainly his fault that he fell asleep and couldn't control his power.

He'd pause letting out steam from within before asking the girl a question, "Do you still reside in sunagakure? And why were those five after you?" //The girl replied, "No I don't reside in that place anymore, they're after me because..I have something of theirs and its vital for my village to have it. It was ours after all." 

The concealed teen sighed hearing this, it looked like yet again he stumbled into something that was best to stay out of though he did promise to acuire peace somehow. "All right, let's make a deal. I'll get you back to your village. Out of harms way, no more being ambushed or attacked. I just want food and shelter for a time in exchange, is that good enough?" The girl replied, "I don't trust you but its better than staying out here waiting to be killed.

The concealed teen smiled behind of his mask, "Thought you'd say that, lead the way." the teen gathered every grain of his material with ease. It was funneled back into his gourd except a good enough portion of sand required for a single platform of iron for two. "Lead the way, i'll protect you my way." with that the sand formed below their feet, it became dense enough to support their weight before levitating lifting the two off into the air in the direction the female pointed.* - Sat Oct  3 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) soon enough, it came into focus. A small village, there were guards present holding the fort. "Mhmm..Those guys won't try to attack will they?" the masked teen asked, the platform of iron declining slowly leveling itself off from above for a smooth decent and potential landing. 

//Girl looked at the masked guy, "No, not as long that i'm with you and unharmed." 

The masked teen understod as the platform landed about three tiles away from the individuals guarding the gate to the village. They looked tense, as if skeptical to attack or not to attack hell he'd be weary around a masked individual approaching his village. 

The girl spoke up, "He's with me. I have what I was to recover." The guards allowed the two through though they were eyeing down the masked individual. The two traveled to the main order of operations within the village, the girl stopped the masked guy from entering."I'll tell the elder, as well as gather your reward."

As the girl departed inside the masked teen acted quickly, he didn't trust her though maybe it was him in general having trust issues. He brought his left hand up to his mask channeling chakra, iron formed out of thin air forming an eye. This eye traveled inside, it hid in the female's shadow. The teen observed the scene that came into focus, the two were chatting. What it was he wasn't sure but he'd find out eventually. The eye moved into position, at this point he read their lips as well as seeing exactly what it might've been. The object was weird, an old artifact most likely but the origin had to be acient. Though he hadn't acuired infromation about it neither did he care he was more concerned about her double crossing him. 

Girl, "By the way, this guy guided me back from the village. I was attacked yet he saved me. For his service he'd like food. Nothing else, just food." 

The elder looked confused for a moment, "Just..food? No money? Just..food?" the female replied, "Yes." The elder sighed, "All right, foo-" "OH! and shelter, shelter as well. Though probably just for the night." The elder thought about this but allowed it, handing the woman a key, "Give him that and *clapped his hands summoning his royal cheifs* They'll wip him up something, then he's out of our hair." with that the girl bowed and headed out.

Reacting to this the eye dispersed, losing its form as it converted back into fine sand. His hands went to his side, fixing itself in his pocket. "Yes?" the masked teen question waiting for an answer that he already expected and knew the answert to.

Girl, "He'll allow you to stay for the night, his chiefs will prepare you food. Then you must be gone." She'd extend a key and pointed in the direction of a ratty apartment.

Concealed teen snatched the key from her grasp, "Tch, thanks." at least he had shelter right? Ratty or not it was better than nothing. Maybe he'd have enough peace to get into contact with -him-. He entered the apartment and closed the door behind of him, it had an upstairs leading out to a balcony. He'd head upstairs, each step emitted a type of screech, the floor boards were loose. Eventually he'd manage to get upstairs and out on the balcony, out there he motioned towards the floor and got into a meditative stance.* - Sat Oct  3 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) couldn't clear his mind, it was too loud. The streets of the village were filled with chatter of all sorts. He'd only hear bits and pieces of it, they were talking about a scientist found dead. This caught his attention, his eyes behind of his mask shot open, his body stod up, his eyes searching double time he listened to the conversation more intently. "She was found hung, black rods through her body like a purcupine or somethin'. Sad faith, probably an experiement gone bad? Either way, it was konoha's doing."

Couldn't believe what he was hearing, one of the civilians possessed a news paper of sort, he shared the infromation with the other villagers. The masked teen brought his left hand up to his left eye channeling chakra. An eye formed, it'd float down observing the words, it read 'engineer was found deceased, with several black rods protruding from her body.  She was hung near Konohagakure's lake and the body has been disposed of recently.  She had a Sunagakure headband around her waist." 

The eye of iron burst, the iron spread across the paper. Anger welled up inside, "AMU!" A furious growl was heard from above from the ratty apartment. Tears leeked from the mask, inside he felt it.. A part of himself being stripped away, another piece of him that kept the little bit of sanity that dwelled in him in check. Their was a burst of chakra felt through out the area, it felt chilly, murderous, foul even. His vision on the world changed, he stod before the beast, it remained behind the ancient letters that binded it, preventing it from escape for now. It laughed and said, "See! You can't protect anyone!" the beast's laugh echo'd drowning out what the teen even tried to say, his vision changed..He was back in reality, iron sand scattered about but he wouldn't lose control. It was what the beast wanted, if he lost faith..his will it'd escape..though this was difficult..he lost..amu. He'd dig through his pouch taking out an old fortune cookie paper, it read "Only you can decide your own path." it was the words Amu inscribed on that paper way back then.. He was furious, "Konoha.. You'll know pain, peace will no longer be attained for you."
* - Sat Oct  3 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) breating wasn't steady, in his mind all he knew was that Konoha had to pay, they stripped him of Amu. Every fiber of his being wanted revenge, he wanted to explode in anger and wipe out the village in his rage. Though he understod as a stategist, things weren't rushed but instead worked out in stages for the success of a plan. His mind worked, contorting all type of schemes for konoha's downfall though, only one thing could be acieved for the time being, a message.

He'd leave the village where he stayed for the time being, he'd leave with the supplies such as food and wanted and depart with out a good bye, nothing it was as if he vanished. He returned to the location where he slaughtered the goons from harming the female earlier. He'd extend a hand, iron sand gathered molding as he formed a paint brush of out of the matterial. He'd kneel down, dip the pain brush in the blood while retreving a blank scroll from his person. On the scroll wrote in blood, "You've stripped the life of what was precious to me, death a waits you. Your days are numbered konoha." the blood stained writing wasn't neat, it was messy though easy enough to decipher. The scroll was attached to a messenger bird. While he'd taken out yet another empty scroll, this scroll was filled with explosive tags fifteen (15) in total and closed off.

Iron sand wrapped around his being, forming a hoodie out of the matterial, it covered his hair as well as his skin. Only his sandals were visible along with the mask he wore, his hoodie of sand swayed and shifted in the wind as if it was alive. 

Now, it was time for his first action to be known. He'd brought his hands up his eye channeling chakra, in turn an eye formed out of iron sand forming an artificial one. That eye gifted him with sight on the area, how many guards at front, potential danger heading his way if his location was given up. At this time he sent the first messenger bird. If sucessful it'd land in the village or at the guards bearing a letter. As the letter was delivered, the next bird was sent forward. As it reached the front gate, hopefully where guards were stationed he'd form a hand seal, his chakra burst outward igniting the paper bombs, a light sizzling in unison was heard faintly as it hopefully exploded at the front gates. Hopefully they wouldn't have known his true identity or what life in question the mystery guy meant, konoha did strip many lifes as of late.

With his message delivered, a platform of iron formed below his feet. He wasn't planning to stick around, the platform soared into the air high, high, high up until he glided above where the clouds would hide him for the moment for his get away.* - Sat Oct  3 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Shukaku the beast fell from the sky above, instead of its regular sandy body an iron clad giant erupted in laughter, the kid had finally lost control even if it may have been brief or not. The beast beckoned to the anger, rage, hate transmitted from the teen within. The iron tanuki head rose high as it gathered chakra, a large amount of the mettalic sand gathered, its shape changed, its size grew massive in comparison to past sand manipulator's own attempt at a sand tsunami. No more words transpired from the beast, the conjured sand rolled back building speed and strength, with both hands trusted forward a massive wave of iron sand washed over the village hopefully destroying it or leveling a large portion of it.* - Sun Oct  4 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hikensha, Takumi(Nexus 420) says: Ha. - Sun Oct  4 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hikensha, Takumi(Nexus 420) says: Nope. - Sun Oct  4 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Shukaku was disappointed there wasn't a challenge for him. Either way it wouldn't suffice, possibly it could have an even greater enemys within. Who knew, possibly not. 

Once the iron tanuki was inside it'd look about, it grunted pissed off even further. "Fuckin' pansies!" its head dropped back, raised at the heaven's for a moment. Possitive and Negative chakra apart of the spectrum gathered at the giant beast's maw melding into one. Wind kicked up from the mass of energy, screams, cries for help, everything was drowned out. As the giant sphere of energy was compressed, its head dropped aiming at what remained of the great nation of konoha, jokes it wasn't that great in his wake."HAAAAAAAA!" echo'd from the beast's as the compressed ball was fired forward, it raced destroying everything in its path. As it reached its desired distance, the bomb, bijuu bomb expanded attempting to level the village to nothing.* - Sun Oct  4 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Shukaku fled the scene after the events unfolded, it was bored. Its figure was seen striding off into the distance, but it soon vanished out of sight.* - Sun Oct  4 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: Damn. - Sun Oct  4 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) heard the distance sounds of birds chirping all around him, a groan was heard from his figure."Ughh.. Wahh..." his eyes opened, light shinned down on him prompting him to shut his eyes tight, eventually his eyes adjusted. Opening his eyes he'd notice it right away, the forest leading to where he laid was destroyed, below him was a large amount of iron sand. He understod what happened, he stammered to his feet and held on to a tree for a balance. 

Using the iron sand that lined a large portion of the forest it shaped below his feet, forming a platform of sand. It rose into the air until he was high above, below him..where konoha once stod was nothing but rubble nothing remained but destruction. A smile formed below his mask, he'd revenged Amu his hands were extended in truimph before he fled the scene. 

"Thank You." he said silently to himself, though it was meant for the beast itself. It probably wouldn't accept it but at least it was said.* - Sun Oct  4 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) gazed from above, his back was pressed against the tree behind of him while he sat on the tree's brance. It seemed about time he'd gotten a move on it, he'd wasted enough time in this land. "Mhmm.." the teen's left hand motioned up towards his mask, it was placed and pressed against the left side of the mask while he channeled chakra. His right hand extended outward, an indle finger pointed off into the distance. At this point utilizing solely chakra he created his own iron sand, that crafted sand molded into a small bird, one of the many small local birds of konohagakure. He'd closed his other eye, gifitng the bird that lack eye sockets sight, it filled with sand that formed an artifical eye for the bird. 

Just like that, it flew into the air in search of any potential threats, pursuers, anything that would be detrimental to the masked teen.* - Mon Oct  5 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //bird scouted from above, a thought ran through the originator's mind. "Yan? Isn't this somethin' else.. Now its him, suna's persistant." out of what seemed to be thin air, iron sand shifted, molding become real in every aspect.. A clone appeared, though it was crafted in the image of Tetsu. At that point the bird vanished from the skies as well.* - Mon Oct  5 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) hands folded across his chest area hearing Yan's word's, he wasn't hostile. At least it didn't seem as if he'd have to fight or hurt a sunagakure shinobi in the process."What for?" the clone asked, at this point the original was closing in.* - Mon Oct  5 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Because that is where you belong, and with everything happening, you need your village behind you as well. - Mon Oct  5 22:43:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) chuckled a little, "Its funny how things work." the clone looked directly at what remained of the village, his back completely turned away from the blonde."Then..What will be of me, after I return?" at this point, the original kept closing in, he had to make up the distance from his true location.* - Mon Oct  5 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am unsure, but I don't think Hassan has any intentions of anything other than incorperating you back into our forces. - Mon Oct  5 22:47:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shook his head, "I understand." with that the Tetsu that he saw, it erupted into iron sand, gone like that. At this point a masked individual came from the shadows."All right, let's get a move on." it was Tetsu's voice, though it was evident he'd gone through his own ordeal of heart ships, it was evident on his clothing.* - Mon Oct  5 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Only cause the village needs me.. - Mon Oct  5 22:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) decided he'd rest for a moment, stamina wise he couldn't catch up with the agile shinobi.. Usually he'd travel by air, it was much easier than walking and faster as well. His eyes behind of the mask darted over in Yan's direction the moment he weaved a seal.. The teen seemed to be rather jumpy, it wasn't him it was mainly being on his toes for such a long period in the wild. "Y-Yes. I'd like some food." From this point he'd clasp his hands, this action caused the robe that he wore to shift and sway about as if it was alive. Though that wasn't the case, the robe itself was iron sand, and that sand was transported back into his gourd revealing a mangled blue shirt underneath, though it obviously didn't reach his skin. 

"Tch.." from this action he'd remove his mask, revealing his face. It was plagued with dirt from his journey, the mask was placed in his bag. At this point the teen seemed normal, despite the abnormally large gourd on his back.* - Mon Oct  5 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked up at the sky for a moment before replying to Yan's question, his expression seemed dark for a moment before he smiled.* - Mon Oct  5 23:09:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I've traveled from the lesser villages. Offered my assistance in exchange for food and water. Got pursued a couple of times.. Nothing much. - Mon Oct  5 23:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes brightened up as the cooked meat was thrown his way, he'd extend a hand outward to catch it. But instead of his own hand catching it iron sand shifted into existance, created from the teen's chakra. A hand extended outward, it grabbed on to the base of cooked rabbit. It reeled in to the teen, he'd brought it up to his mouth and began feasting on the roasted hare.

"I-Its good." the teen complimented between chews and the process of swallowing the food before him.* - Mon Oct  5 23:20:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm.." to some degree the village seemed the same, though there were some obvious advances, changes even. He felt alienated in this place, though it was probably brought on because of the pongent stench emited from the teen. "*Sniff* Phew..Geez..." it was decided a bath was in order but where? He'd look around the village, the area he'd come across seemed familiar. In the distance a house stod, a smile formed on his face.. His feet moved on his own, he'd race forward. His hand reaced out for the door knob but it was locked, "Wahh?" the teen questioned. Inside it had light coming from it, someone was inside his house? Nope that wouldn't go well, he wanted back his property now.

The teen knocked hard on the wooden door, in moments a small child opened up. Seeing him he'd sigh leaving the place.. It didn't matter, his home was given up for rent. Instead he'd have to settle for the sunagakure inn. There he'd purchase a room, recieved a room key, and entered the room. The room was rather small, the bed wasn't comfy, though that was better in his case. The shower..it was decent, he didn't waste anymore time Tetsumi stripped his clothing, turned on the water and hoped into the shower.* - Tue Oct  6 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) finished with his shower, he looked at his old shirt..It wouldn't be of use to him any longer, plus with sunagakure's temperature he needed something a bit more snug to adjust to the heat. After getting dressed he'd purchase a cloak from the shop keeper, a brand new one that fit him a lot better than the previous one he wore in his youth. "Thank You." he'd pay the clurk and venture off into the now congested village.* - Tue Oct  6 01:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: You two may have the first move. - Tue Oct  6 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) didn't seem worried at all, he was waiting for the two to at least attack already, "I'm waiting." the teen brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body clasping his hands as he said this. What he was doing? He was gathering chakra and converting this gathered chakra into magnetic forces enabling his field of magnetism.* - Tue Oct  6 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: That's an epic earth technique...Maybe she'll teach me. - Tue Oct  6 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "...Mhmm..." felt the earth beneath him shake madly, "Wha?.." the teen questioned as the dome of earth rose up trapping him inside. Though it seemed to have one obvious opening, this opening itself had one openign, an opening in which it seemd a river gushed fourth from. "Oh dear!" the teen said jookingly, at this time he clapped his hands. Reacting to this sand erupted from his gourd, it branced off. A section of the sand positioned itself beneath his feet forming a platform of sand. This sand levitated from the sand below, this gifted him with flight and the ability to avoid Trillian's attack.

Next he'd raise his hands skyward, all of the sand and more that was produced from his gourd rushed forward it shaped itself ino a drill that began drilling away at the earth dome's sealing in an attempt to escape.

If this was possibly he'd fly through the brand new opening.* - Tue Oct  6 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to drill away to freedom, though this might've ended shortly for him. Above him an intense vibration is felt from his sand, right after a massive explostion rang out sending earth about, a shockwave. Plus from below Thrilliam hand was forced as projectiles of stone raced through the air. All of these attacks, "Damnit." he'd underestimated them.. Would it be the end of the spar? At this dire moment, the moment that the teen ran the risk of being injured his sand burst forward, it formed a dome of sand that protected the teen it completely inclosed him preventing dammage.. Hopefully his ultimate defense would hold true to its name and hold up?

"Time to get serious!" was heard from within the dome, he'd extended all of his fingers outward, gigantic spokes protruded from the shield of sand which continued upward battling through the falling debree etc in hopes of escaping. He hoped the female would've moved.* - Tue Oct  6 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: I hope Kilm is just as strong...I have an appointment with him. - Tue Oct  6 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Just keep training, is all I can say. - Tue Oct  6 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I remember back when my brother was alive..No matter what I did, he always seemed to be able to beat me. - Tue Oct  6 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Now..I'd like to think he'd be proud of me. - Tue Oct  6 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well...for the most part. - Tue Oct  6 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I know you will be a strong shinobi, Trilliam. I can see the fire in you. - Tue Oct  6 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: If you say soo... - Tue Oct  6 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) the spiked shield created levitated above, the shield ceased to be right after. There weren't anymore potential threats, it lowered revealing the teen levitated on a platform of iron. With his sight cleared he noticed Thrillian given up, "One down, One more to go." was heard from the teen. 

And then he'd attempt to finish the match quickly, He'd make a few hand gestures, signalling the sand to stretch about above, additional sand was conjured and even crafted from his chakra alone.. It would be enough to cover the entire area. It was as if a shadow covered the entire area, dark...

(Strategem perk.) At this time he dropped his hand, the iron sand shaped itself into countless droplets that fell from above. These droplets weren't sharp, just shaped like droplets of rain.* - Tue Oct  6 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Now I want to spar... - Tue Oct  6 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) each droplet of iron that managed to even make contact with the fleeing shinobi began clumbing into one, preventing movement, gathering and growing. Even if she did manage to flee below she'd be covered in his sand, he'd make a simple hand gesture prompting the sand to bind further movement, it'd cover a  portion of her skin encasing her in his essence."There is no escape."* - Tue Oct  6 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) lowered the platform of iron from above, "Mhmm.." the platform as well as every grain of sand that could've fit in his gourd funneled back into it, a cork out of the left over matterial formed an iron cork that fixed itself over the hole of the container preventing potential spills.* - Tue Oct  6 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I need to improve. - Tue Oct  6 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) If it was possibly he'd leave the scene, no more words shared between the group. * - Tue Oct  6 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Even at this level... - Tue Oct  6 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Landmine fist...isn't good enough yet. - Tue Oct  6 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Especially since i'm back here. I'll have to train even harder." he realized this, he trained in his travels but he'd have to increase it up a notch. Apart of him didn't want to rely soley on One'O power. Though it did help him accomplish his first objective for revenge after Amu's death, he just needed to stay in the shadows.. He had to become stronger, contribute to this dying village's cause and find a way to settle his delema.

So many thoughts flowing into his mind, it'd be a lot more difficult in this village to concentrate... For now even if he wanted to contact the beast and have a little chat, it wasn't best he did with so many things on his mind. Both of his hands pointed downward at his feet, chakra built up in his hands he'd closed his eyes. The chakra emited from the teen crafted his own iron sand that settled itself below his feet, the sand became dense supporting his weight before rising into the air. From above he'd observe the village, he did really feel alienated from his own home. "Heh, I have to protect this place as well." a tear drop escaped from his left eye as he said this, why? He'd mainly failed in every attempts to protect something valuable to him, even Amu in the end. 

"Its only the bad chapter of your novel hero." the teen spoke to himself, he tried to boost his own confidence.* - Tue Oct  6 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) watched from above.* - Tue Oct  6 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Gotcha'. - Tue Oct  6 05:55:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh. I've gotten as far as the Lotus Seal. - Tue Oct  6 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Dunno' what that is but it sounds cool. - Tue Oct  6 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So I can set traps. But I can't take away chakra, or restrict movements. - Tue Oct  6 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'll teach you earth release if you teach me the basics of sealing techniques. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh, that's easy. Alright. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Later though. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: M'kay. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And Izanami, it was fun sparring you. - Tue Oct  6 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You're becoming an awesome ninja, even at such a young age. - Tue Oct  6 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You roll so quickly! - Tue Oct  6 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I honestly don't know how you do that. - Tue Oct  6 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah, you're pretty good for a little girl. - Tue Oct  6 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: About half as good as me, when I was your age. - Tue Oct  6 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm... At least she's improved over the years." commented from above in a lowered tone. He'd wasted enough time as it was watching over izanami's duel, it was time for his training. The platform of iron departed from the skies above the arena, it seemed as if the airborne teen was headed out of the village.* - Tue Oct  6 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "This'll be good enough." the platform of iron lowered, the area below was ideal for the type of training he had in mind. It was quiet, though it wouldn't be as peaceful soon enough it'd be filled with the sound of his iron sand's melody. As the teen landed he swiftly brought his hands up to his mid-section, at this point he clapped his hands signaling an eruption of sand. The iron cork slackened as it was forcefully shot into the air, that portion of sand that too formed the cork converted back into iron sand filling in with the mass amount of sand conjured.

He'd take in a deep breath, as he exhaled sections of the iron sand broke apart. It broke off into four sections or clumps of the manipulated sand. These broken of discarded lumps of sand began shifting molding into the teen's own image. Four iron sand clones were easily formed, there was another pause between his next technique.. This was an area that the manipulator had to improve on, his movements had to be swift, swift enough to leave no room for the opponent to react...Death would be the only option.

Tetsumi made another hand gesture, a single hand was aimed at one of the four clones. This prompted his iron sand to react quick, it was second nature to him at this point. The sand wrapped around the clone's body, in an instant the clone was wrapped up its movement restricted as it was binded by the sand. Yet another pause..He forcefully clenched his fist causing the sand ti implode eradicating the clone within, sand and sand erupted about changing the color of the sand on the ground. * - Tue Oct  6 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "One out of commission three more..Its nothin' I can handle em'. No complainin'." a smile formed on his face, his left hand pointed at the next clone in his line up, yet another cluster of sand branced off. The sand from the destroyed clone replenished the amount of iron sand in the field, the sand in all broke apart. He knew the amount of sand required to bind the entire iron clone's being. 

The iron sand obeyed his commad, it reacted quickly racing towards the next victim's body. The sand latched on the clone's body, lump after lump restricting its movement in the end its entire existance was covered in Iron sand, it was closed off from the world. There was yet another pause between the sequence of jutsu."C'mon." he'd noticed the lag between executing these techniques, though maybe it was only him. 

Yet again like the last time he clenched his open causing the sand's grip on the clone to tighten before it imploded, more sand rained about scattering across the training ground he selected.* - Tue Oct  6 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) felt the deference there was toll on his chakra and stamina as well, though he wouldn't be the first or the last to have felt this feeling.. The feeling of pain from training, it was time to make up for his slacking. From the fallen clone more of the blackened sand was retrieved, increasing the amount of available sand to manipulate. It was odd, so much of the matterial was present, yet he knew he could manipulate every grain of it to his whim..He had improved over the course of five years? Give or take, he felt accomplished but seeing Izanami's progress it pissed him off.. He was happy for his sister's improvement but the rate she was excelling in...He'd be left in the wind, he couldn't allow that.

His determination wouldn't faulter, his hand extended outward at the next clone.. Grain after grain raced over to the next clone binding its movement, it consumed the iron sand clone whole. He'd clenched his opened palm yet again, the iron's grip on it tightened..It became unbearable until it imploded leaving not a trace but an eruption of the fine material.* - Tue Oct  6 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes looked over to the remaining iron sand clone, nothing but the metallic sand and the clone comprised of this material remained. "The final clone." the teen commented as he formed a hand gesture, this gesture prompted the iron sand to clamp on to the last remaining from its feet up to the crown of its head. In seconds the once bare clone was wrapped up its movement stripped from it.

Another pause between the finishing blow, which seemed to be mearly seconds passing but Tetsu saw this as a flaw..An opening for the enemy to potentially break free, he wasn't having that. His open palm closed, the sand squeezed, tightning until the sand imploded snuffing out the life the clone once had. This was the end of the training session for now, he'd probably resume later. 

Motioned towards the floor, he was tired..Tired from a little exercise as this one. He could imagine the beast laughing at this, scolding him. This made him laugh, he'd taken this as attention from the beast. If there weren't people to try and keep you down, why would you try to improve yourself, right? * - Tue Oct  6 08:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) laid on the sand, around the area was blackened with the matterial he manipulated changing the scenery a little..It looked as if the natural sand of the area was charred from intense flames, though that wasn't the case. Every last inch of the blackened sand funneled back into his gourd, last minute he'd strip a portion of the sand from the section that returned to the gourd. The torn off section fashioned itself under the teen, it formed into a platform that immediately became dense to support his weight. The manipulator soon levitated, his hands were placed behind of his head while he relaxed.. He did need some time to relax for a little, he'd point behind of him. Off in the distance a little bit of the material remained, that piece of the puzzle was crafted into an iron cork that sealed off the top of the gourd he wore, this prevented potential spills.

"Mhmm.." he looked up at the sky, things had changed.* - Tue Oct  6 08:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm?" eyes weavered away from the sky for a moment, he'd glanced at Sanoke's figure bearly catching every detail of the male, though he recognized him from the plaza as well as after the spar between those two explosive shinobi."Yes, I don't sleep.. So its best I train to past the time, ya'know?" his body continued to levitate thanks to the platform, in a sense this too was training, basically chakra control.* - Tue Oct  6 09:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) laughed at Sanoke's words, though he may have been right. Either way it was a price he'd have to pay for Sunagakure's sake or anything else he cared about that he didn't desire to be stripped from him. "Death...Wonder what type of dreams i'd have when its time. Though it'd never be as worse if I slept. Its just isn't for me, my body has gotten used it at this point." didn't see an issue in sleeping at this point, it'd been years since he last slept..well besides the incident in konoha where he doozed off for what felt like a couple of seconds.* - Tue Oct  6 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Maybe i'd be back with Jak, Adhara, Kastya, Amu, Kronos, Seto, Savae...Izashim..So many.. - Tue Oct  6 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm... I know you aren't joking. Though its best to laugh at life sometimes." the teen paused once more another chuckle emited from his figure, it was funny even someone who hadn't known him could see it..Though even if Sanoke didn't now who or what defeated him numerous of times despite easily dominating those two from earlier.. They weren't a challenge, more of a hindrance when he had to hold back like this but it was a lesson of self control for him. 

"They weren't a challenge, though their abilities impressed me a lot. They'll be great, that one that gave up just has to believe. Else he'll lose his way like most shinobi and travel through the darkness aimlessly." compared to all of the past shinobi he'd fought.. They weren't up to par, hell even zetsumo destroyed his defenses. He wouldn't allow something like that to happen again, eventually he'd make some progress in the long hours he'd trained.* - Tue Oct  6 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to gaze at the sky, "Maybe one day we'll spar, if you're afriad to get a little sand in your pants its best you stop carrying around that shell from now, ehehe." though this was only meant as a joke, mainly because of the shell on his back but was it more durable than his defense? Who knew."Hassan?" the teen smiled to himself, in his youth...well earlier days as a shinobi he'd fougth Hassan and won, though the geezer probably allowed him to win.

He'd let Sanoke's words gel into his membrain, despite who he might've been, weak or strong he took valuable information and ate it up."I train to someday achieve peace, i've witnessed countless shinobi lose their lives over meaningless things such as war. I want to pleague this world of it, though i'll take one step at a time." he did partially achieve this purging of evil..Though he hadn't fully acieved this it was only the top layer of the cake, the icing of it.

"A demon..." the teen repeated this three times before he ceased talking completely. He'd closed his eyes thinking about One'O, the beast within. It wasn't its name either way, it didn't seem to mind. Well besides the usual threats and all of that good stuff.* - Tue Oct  6 10:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "World peace shall be obtained one day, I won't give up on it." though Sanoke had a point..everytime it seemed like everything was settling down, another threat loomed from the shadows..An example to this was mainly the teen's entire life thus far, there never was a moment he could relax, unwind..Especially now, if he even tried, dreamed of it..It'd lead to destruction and possible death for even him, this is why his guard was always up.

Though he didn't reply to the hermit after his choice of words, though he wanted to say "Yeah, just one. A loud mouth tanuki that robbed me of my sleep, he tries to eat away at my determination and dreams like the actual ones that are no longer in my grasp." But he learned not to complain anymore, it wouldn't solve anything the teen was growing up. 

He'd snap back to reality for a brief moment, "I'll catch you around?" with that the platform of iron raised into the air higher and higher while the teen laid back relaxing as he levitated elsewhere, maybe into the sunset? Nahhh, most likely towards sunagakure's inn since his previous home had new occupants living there now. * - Tue Oct  6 10:30:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) would attempt to leave, "What a strange guy." was left on his mind, though he'd never once dropped his guard.* - Wed Oct  7 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Guess i'll train..these guys seem dead. - Wed Oct  7 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) decided he'd resume his training, the villagers of this village did nothing but stare off into space, waiting for something to happen. He wouldn't be like them, he'd be ready for the upcoming storm in the distance. For a second before arriving at his training location he'd reflect on the shinobi named Kang Tetsu, it was a shame he'd taken his own life..such was life, right?

"Shinobi are truely idiots." maybe he was a bit bitter because most shinobi he'd come across easily chose death. "Why death? Why not life?" the teen wasn't sure, maybe they were weak maybe there was something in death he hadn't seen cause he refused to die, refused to give up.

Either way, he didn't care for it. The iron cork on his gourd slackened, it flew airborne converting back into iron sand. At this moment more of the blackened sand erupted from his gourd. Out of the material conjured he'd split off a section of the sand, this split off section was molded into something different. A physical body comprised of the material, a clone. 

Yet another pause, the other half of the sand raced forward. It clamped on at specific points on the clone's body first, such as its feet and hands first. A practice he was improving on, it'd be useful in actual combat. No hand seals, meant no jutsu, no feet meant there was no escape. Next the sand bombarded the clone's body, further restraining every inch of his body, the end result it'd be cloaked in the material. 

A few seconds passed between the finishing blow of the technique. His palm was opened, extended outward aimed at the cloaked clone. Focefully he closed his open palm, the sand around the clone gripped tighter, it'd be unbereable until the sand imploded. Iron sand washed over the training ground as the clone was destroyed.* - Wed Oct  7 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) separated the sand, a portion of the sand molded back into a perfect copy of the destroyed clone, every aspect of it looked identical to the original. As the clone reformed more sand raced forward, he'd repeat the same strategy as before. The sand binded the clone's feet first, then its hands, after these two vital areas were binded more of the sand clamped on to the clone's figure until it was completely comsumed in the material.

A few seconds passed before the finishing blow, his left hand remained extended outward his palm visible. The teen closed his hand once more, sending great pressure through the sand, it squeezed and squeezed until it imploded destroying the clone of iron once again. "Mhmm.." he'd look off into the distance for a moment, he could hear the chatter around. 

He'd make a hand gesture, causing every grain of the blackened sand to funnel back into his gourd. Though a little bit of the material was left behind this was molded into a cork and placed at the top blocking the hole and preventing potential spills, from there he'd set off towards the square.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm..And you're alive as well, I guess its..great seeing you two." it truely had been some time, Izanami looked as if she'd gotten taller or it was probably his eyes playing tricks on him.

Then again if it didn't life went on, he learned this in his travels. Though he didn't answer the other question, was the teen actually 'good'? Maybe Maybe not, but he wasn't going to cry over his shit poor life and losing someone precious to him during his travels.* - Wed Oct  7 02:29:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) extended his left hand outward, as he did this iron sand reacted to his chakra out of what seemed to be thin air a single kunai formed. As it formed it sped forward, cutting through the air aimed at the farmer's feet, a test of his reflexes. Hell it wasn't even as fast as he could manipulate it to, probably about six speed.* - Wed Oct  7 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) watched as the kunai clashed, both clattered to the floor, "And you're better at farming?" the teen rose a single eyebrow as he questioned the man.
