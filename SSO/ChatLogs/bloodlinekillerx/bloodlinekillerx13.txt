<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) as quickly as he appeared at Madelyn's side, was as quick as he'd leave again..Guards rushed over to his side, "Someone's at the gate." the teen sighed complaining a bit.

//Tetsu"Can't you get someone else? I'm busy." he'd look over towards Madelyn, plus it didn't seem right especially since he just got off.

//Guard"No. Remember, Yan's still on vacation." the guard left him with these words before vanishing in a plume of sand.

//Tetsumi released a sigh, "I'll be right back.." his words were heavy before he too vanished but in a swirl of blackened sand.* - Tue Oct 20 20:54:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sensed..death..danger. A shiver traveled down his spine, something was behind him, nasty evil..S-Should he turn around?  Everything about him changed, the once relaxed, laid back Jounin was frightened. He'd slowly turn around noticing Madelyn, her hips placed on her hips.."So cute." the teen thought, a voice boomed through out his mind laughing.

//Shukaku, "Nope..you're about to get it. HEHEHE, RUN TETSUMI RUN!"
its voice vanished, leaving him to the mercy of Madelyn's wrath."Oh god, i'm dead.." the teen mumbled below his breath.* - Tue Oct 20 21:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was hauled away by pulled by his ear willed by Madelyn, "Oh god help me!" the teen thought while looking above, he'd soon be out of sight, dragged away by an angry, crazy girlfriend.* - Tue Oct 20 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mai(Fat Trel) says: ...What? - Tue Oct 20 21:07:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) expression of fright turned into saddness. He understod where Madelyn was coming from, though he hadn't any plans or thoughts of leaving nore ditching her like previously..As a shinobi especially a jounin, things like that happened though he'd taken the blame for it. It kinda reminded him how he'd been towards his father  when the man was alive and a Jounin, it was the same feelings. She'd try to bend his finger, the result of this..Iron sand materialized defending the teen from potential harm, though he'd bend his hand in the direction she desired since, he still wanted her to feel as if she was doing something.

He'd look into her eyes, the saddness slowly fading away from his face until it was completely erased. It was reformed with a concerned, understanding lover."I understand, I'm sorry. I wouldn't ever leave you, its just an important matter came up and I had to travel to Kirigakure for an assignment." he'd attempt to lean in closer, the coating of iron sand spread along his finger just the shield of sand making sure it protected the child.

His one free hand wrapped around her waist pulling her closer into his."Its not like that, What I feel for you. Its all in my heart, you completed the hole that was there, the loniness I felt in the past." he'd attempt to press and allign his forehead against his crazy girlfriend's forehead.* - Tue Oct 20 21:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) after the kiss he'd pull away as well, his stare deepened thinking elsewhere for the time being, he'd think of her words. "I-I can't bring myself to see you get hurt on my type of missions..I usually take B or A ranked assignments, its..its always certain death. I don't know what i'd do if I wasn't able to react and protect you in time. Maybe we could train an'..th-then maybe i'll think about it." he tried so desperately to get Madelyn to refuse, or rethink this. Then again, he knew her and his words wouldn't change anything unless it was giving her the determination to train harder until she could've accompanied him on a mission.

Since his other hand was free at this time he'd wrap it around his waist supporting his solo hand. He'd whisper in Madelyn's ear, "You sure..About the pain thing?" though, he knew she was deas serious. Either way, if it'd calm her down mentally he'd do anything to keep her sane. 

A smile formed on his lips, though inside he was unsure what in the world that he was going to do. From this point on, he'd be winging it. He pushed Madelyn away gently, her back would be against the wall directly behind her. He'd focus channeling chakra and gathering iron sand at his palm. Eventually Iron sand gathered out of thin air it seemed to the normal eye, it was shaped into an iron whip. He'd turn her around, his left hand pressed against he back enough for her to arch her back, thus revealing a better view and aiming point of her ass. He'd made a hand gesture once Madelyn was in the desired position, he'd held back greatly just enough force to cause her to feel a sting from the whip. It'd crackle forward spanking her, whipping her behind with the whip. Hopefully this was enough force to suffice her desire for pain, "I..Feel bad..Oh my.." the teen thought, he'd begin to feel a bit uneasy.* - Tue Oct 20 21:44:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) heart raced, his face burned bright until it transitioned to a bright red color. He was unsure about this inside, though he wanted to please his woman. A devious grin stretched across his face, she rose her skirt revealing the short pants beneath it. Once more, the iron whip cranked back whipping her behind a total of three tims, whip after whip. He was slowly feeling this, the pain he caused Madelyn was returned with suductive cries for his name.* - Tue Oct 20 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) held out his hand, the whip crafted from his blackened sand converted back into the material, it fell to the sands below mixing in with the natural grain below. Madelyn then turned around walking towards him, instictively as her hands wrapped around his neck pulling him in for a kiss. His hands wrapped around her waist while both of them kissed passionately. Though, he witnessed the fruits of his labor, her ass cheeks were red from the beating induced by his whip. 

She'd begin to guide his hands towards her ass, he'd whisper in her ear returning the same words she'd given him."I love you too, Madelyn." once his hands were at her ass, he'd borrow beneath his dress just to rest and message his hands around her reddened round ass.* - Tue Oct 20 22:41:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) arrived at the restaurant alongside Madelyn, it was a BBQ house. "Mhmm..Maybe not the best place but.." the teen was lost in thought while at the front door of the establishment. "Mhmm..Is this place all right?" Tetsumi questioned Madelyn before even attempting to enter it, there were many other shops within the booming village of sunagakure, it didn't matter how expensive it'd cost he'd pay for it willingly.

If she did agree to the BBQ house, he'd enter and order some food for himself and Madelyn. * - Wed Oct 21 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) lead Madelyn inside the BBQ house, despite how loud the girl was and how many stares it drew to the two. He just kepted smiling, once he was with his crazy girlfriend everything else didn't matter. Especially the hightened stare of hatred focused not towards Madelyn but focused on Tetsumi himself. Though it didn't bother him in the slightest."I guess..we could get either...Pork Chops or Ribs? Actually..it doesn't matter, i'll cover the bill." 

The waiter finnally arrived to their table, he was frightened for some reason.* - Wed Oct 21 00:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) blushed the moment Madelyn's hands touched his own hands, from there her head rested on his shoulder. He felt at peace, maybe this was what Shukaku meant. At least now he wasn't alone, and was at peace with himself.

//The waiter, "I-Is that all?" the guy questioned, his eyes mainly focused on Madelyn straying away from making eye contact with Tetsumi for some odd reason."

//Tetsumi, "I'd like what she's having..With a side of BBQ sauce and....A LOT OF HOT SAUCE!!!!" he'd try to make this a competition between himself and his girlfriend. 

//Waiter shook his head, writing down their order."Anything to drink?" he'd ask before going to relay the message to the cooks.

//Tetsumi answered the man."Err..Just a water that'll be fine." he knew he'd need a water, hot things..it was only a bluff for Madelyn plus getting a taste of something she liked. Oh boy was Tetsumi in for it this time.* - Wed Oct 21 00:50:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //Waiter understod, he'd wrote down two tall glasses of water before leaving.

//Tetsumi looked over, staring into Madelyn's eyes "W-Wahh?..W-With out anything to drink?..ALL RIGHT! THAT'S EASY!" he shouted these words on the outside, but on the inside it went a little like"Oh God..I'm going to lose.." though, he had to keep up apperances, the man had to be tough!

About twenty minutes passed, the Waiter returned with the two tall glasses of water and a platter of ribs bathed in mainly hot sauce but had BBQ sauce as well. He'd pray before digging in, why? Because surely he'd burn his tongue off and lose to Madelyn. He'd reopen his eyes, winking at Madelyn "Ready when you are!"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I'M NOT GOING TO LOSE!" as Madelyn reached out for a rib, his left then his right hand reached out for two ribs for each hand. From the left hand to the right, he'd begin to eat from both hands. "H-Hot!" the teen thought as he continued to eat, he was determined to win.* - Wed Oct 21 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shot a side glance over towards Madelyn's way mostly keeping track of her progress. How she attacked the ribs, determined to win..It made him smile, it seperated her from the girly girls, it made things intresting fun even.

He'd finished the two rips, he descarded the bones to the side of his plate. Both his left and right reached out for yet another pair of ribs, it was round two for him."Not...*chew* Going..*chomp* TO LOSE!!!" the teen said between breaks in between chewing, and while he smartly tried letting air into his mouth to try and quell the heat of the hot sauce.* - Wed Oct 21 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) grabbed two more ribs from from the platter, one rib in the left and another in the right hand/ He'd shot a quick glance over from his ribs to Madelyn, "You giving up already my love?" the teen snickered, his eyes were waterty from the heat, though he had to keep up apperances, and so far it seemed as if he'd win. From Madelyn he'd refocus on his ribs eating from both, transitioning from the left to the right one.* - Wed Oct 21 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) placed the other two finished ribs off to the side of his plate, "So..Hot.." the teen commented in his mind, but it didn't seem to get to Madelyn at all. She kepted on trucking, "Heh, you're my girlfriend. And you're about the lose." the teen replied to his girlfriend's words, he didn't care about cleanliness his face was coated in hot sauce mixed with BBQ sauce, he was a mess.* - Wed Oct 21 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) panted, allowing the air to travel into his mouth and down his lungs. Inside he felt as if he was on fire literally. If smoke would've been visible it'd be seen from his nose and mouth, he was overheating.."W-Water.." the teen thought, he'd shake off this desire for it..He could do it, he didn't have to eat the most ribs..Just out do Madelyn in the tolerance of such heat.

His left hand fixed itself around an idle rib, he'd brought it up to his mouth begining to feast on it.* - Wed Oct 21 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to devour ribs left and right. He'd pause looking over at Madelyn noticing she was struggling."Are you okay over there? Do you need...WAAAATEERRR?!" the teen teased. Honestly, he too was at his limit just one more taste of that hot sauce and he'd be out of it.* - Wed Oct 21 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) hands flew in the air in truimph after winning, though the heat finnally got to him. He'd blushed as Madelyn wiped his mouth, stripping it of the BBQ sauce and hot sauce. After this, his right hand raced forward for his tall glass of water, right down the hatch he chugged the liquid. It cooled him down, between breaths of relief he'd mutter, "T-Thank You Madelyn." he'd even forgot for a moment he'd actually won.

At this time the waiter returned with the bill."Ohh..Tha-.." the teen stopped after notcing the price of the bill..His heart shattered inside, the tears from the heat of the hot sauce that he kepted in check flowed down."So..expensive..." he'd thought while paying for the bill, in truth Madelyn won in this department but he didn't mind, this was the sacrifice of treating his girlfriend.* - Wed Oct 21 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: I can help with the bill honey! - Wed Oct 21 02:13:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) wiped his hands in a napkin, making sure the BBQ sauce was removed good enough.
