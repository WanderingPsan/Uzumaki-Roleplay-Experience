<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Y-Yeah... - Sat Nov  7 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I hate making the first move." he'd thought while his hands flowed up to the mid-section of his body. Clasping his hands he gathered chakra, the gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field.  He'd take another look of the terrain in the dessert, taking mental notes of it for later strategic use."This is a little better." he'd thought, though didn't feel like sparing Ai, not one bit.

The iron cork located at the top of the teen's gourd was removed, the cork fell towards the ground, and an eruption of blackened sand was visible. The large amount of sand was released from the teen's gourd, it was controlled fairly easily. One portion of the sand raced forward toward Ai's figure at a fast pace, while another portion of the sand branched off spreading in an aerial fashion over Ai. It casted a shadow of impending trouble, but how would Ai react with these two threats, it was a mystery Tetsumi would find out.* - Sat Nov  7 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Oh?" was heard from the teen as Ai turned into paper, paper planes at that. It was beautiful seeing this fine art, though he knew despite its elegant look it probably was dangerous or mediocure. Either way he'd watch as Ai flew upward, the paper clashing against his sand, though instead of overpowering said paper he'd observe and allow Ai to paritally reform above.

"Mmmm." was heard from the teen, though he stayed idle a little too long. The paper crafted in paper kunai that surrounded him at every possible angle, he was in a bind."Seems like you've got me." he'd say while laughing, as the kunai propelled forward, another large portion of iron sand burst into life on its own from the teen's gourd forming a dense dome like shield to trap the teen within, away from harm. The paper clashed against his shield of ironsand, would it break through? Probably not.

With this coming into play, it was time to make this a lot more fun. He'd brought two fingers up towards the teen's left eye, channeling chakra to the left eye iron sand materialized out of thin air beyond the shield of sand above, simply monitoring the battlefield and opening his sight of everything else beyond the darkness of the protective shield. 

He'd make a handgesture from within the dome, more sand burst to life from around the area. The sand molded into ten shuriken each, these metallic shurikens made out of the teen's sand raced forward for the partially formed Ai attempting to bombard her from all sides. "What will you do now, Ai?" the teen thought while safe inside of his dome.* - Sat Nov  7 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to watch from the safety of his dome of iron sand, his eye levitating above the battlefield taking in everything and analyzing it in full. In all honesty, the best approach for the teen was to subdue the real Ai, not worry about her paper weapons. He had a plan and she'd fallen right into it. He'd extend his fingers forward, clashing against the paper shuriken meant to oppose his own shuriken of iron sand. The result of this was, his shuriken cut straight through Ai's own shuriken, shredding them in the process. The shurikens then continued onward attempting to strike Ai, but his shuriken were instead met with Ai's shield of paper causing the total of ten shuriken to be lodged in the shield.

"Nice.. Oh?!" he'd notice the ten shuriken swords crafted from the paper itself. Would they crash through his iron sand shield? He wasn't sure, but to make sure... He'd make another hand gesture from within the dome of iron sand, the sand around the area formed into dense blobs of iron sand. These blobs of iron sand raced forward at the ten blades attempting to pierce through his shied. In doing so he'd knock the blade off course. He'd just match the speed of his sand to her papers.

(Stratagem Perk) Now it was time to put his plan into action, The remaining sand around the area, a large amount of iron sand raced upward towards Ai's real figure. The sand in itself spread about, attempting to inclose her in a dome of sand, trapping her inside of said dome to prevent escape. He'd match pure speed to accomplish this feat, meaning his sand's true speed. If she was trapped inside and the threat was taken care of, the dome of sand around him would've fell to the sand around him, falling limp, lifeless even. Inside of the dome, large spikes were formed all around the dome incase Ai had any plans of escaping.

"Yo give up, if you move i'll be forced to act!" he'd holler out at the trapped Ai." hopefully she'd listen to reason? He really didn't want to hurt her in truth, he'd held back in the match as much as he could.* - Sat Nov  7 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widned as Ai's voice echo'd through out the area, this wasn't good for the teen. As Ai attempted to attack with the combined efforts of her paper blades he'd analyze everything. The entire situation slowed down for him, his mind worked double time. His sand a large portion of it burst into life, forming a dome of iron sand around the teen to protect against the assault,  in doing so he was protected from the paper blades.. Or was he truely? The paper blades continued forward, piercing through his sand easily. More sand materialized to meld the iron sand shield's wounds keeping the blades out from actually hurting Tetsumi. (This basically was possibly since his shield of sand moves at a speed of fifteen tiles, halfing the dammage at first, as the blades actually broke through, the sand matched up with the speed once more to nullify the blades, rendering them useless as well as lodged in his sand. Though, if Ai proceeded to pierce through the sand she'd defineatly get him in the next turn.)

"Mhmm... I'll do that while she can't see me from inside here." he was back against the wall, why not use that tactic?  Another portion of the sand erupted from his gourd, it formed into a drill that drilled away at the sand below his feet allowing for an exit point, falling through the hole he'd lie in wait for the right time. He'd push back the sand into place for the time being, giving the look as if Tetsumi still either vanished or used shunshin at the last moment to escape? Who knew how Ai would interprit this action.

Though he had another issue, Ai would be on to him if they pierced through the sand and Tetsumi wasn't no where to be found. With the sand that remained within the shield of sand, a portion of sand formed into a copy of the teen. Yup, right out of the sand itself. He looked like a splitting image of Tetsumi, he'd have to play the role.* - Sat Nov  7 21:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) clone was caught, it was restricted tight preventing even movement from him, if he even dared to that is. Underground, the real Tetsumi brought two fingers up towards his left eye, he'd closed the eye while placing his the two fingers over it. He'd channeled chakra towards the air, in the air above the battlefield iron sand gathered out of thin air forming an eye that overlooked the battlefield. From his position below the earth Tetsumi took into acount everything. With the down fall of his clone, it seemed as if he'd lost. In the air above, Ai had finally revealed herself though she didn't form completely back. It made him wonder if half of her were trapped in the sand before or she was holding on him, had something else up her sleve incase this was a trap.

He could've gone about this in various ways, but he had the ideal plan. "She'll most likely scatter if I attack.. soo... Mmmm." A large portion of the sand spread raced upward, it raced from the ground, well the sand below Ai whom was above in the sky. The iron sand itself formed into droplets that rained upward instead of downward. It was the opposite of his normal drizzle of sand, by doing this it'd be a larger ranger to potentially bind Ai if she wished to scatter. If Ai chose to scatter or not, the rain or clumps of sand that covered a large amount of the area began clumping on to her, or her paper in general. Why? He'd begin to bind her and her paper, rendering movement useless. Plus it'd be harder to avoid giving the fast pace and large range of the plan.* - Sat Nov  7 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm?" the teen commented underground, as the roof comprised of paper was crafted. He had some work to be done, the droplets of iron sand that smashed into Ai's roof paper defense merged together, its shape changed into a drill. Said drill began rotating, swirling away at the roof, piercing through the paper shield with ease. 

On piercing through it, the sand deconstructed. His eye in the air, kept track of the battle so far but he didn't detect the switch. The eye positioned on what he thought was the real Ai, manipulating his sand the sand forced its way through the hole that the drill of iron sand created. The iron sand quickly and effectively attempted to wrap around the paper clone Ai, rendering her movements useless. He thought the battle was finished, but waited.  His eye kept scanning the area, for even the slightest of movement from Ai's papers or anything else.

Did he actually won?* - Sat Nov  7 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) unfornately for himself or Ai's plan. His third eye only gifted him with sight on the battlefield, not hearing. So he didn't know what clone Ai might've been saying, he was underground after all.  He'd add a little more chakra to his third eye technique, keeping it in play a little longer.


He was at a dead lock, he didn't know what Ai was saying or if she said anything at all. Though if any paper were still floating about, he wouldn't let the paper clone free.* - Sat Nov  7 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) observed as the binding of paper slackened from around the clone, meaning she'd given up? Who knew. He'd remove the sand from the caught clone, the sand trickled down from the sky, falling back down on to the floor, lifeless. In the mean time, the original was still underground waiting. 

"Since this is it. I guess i'll leave. Tunnel back to the village. I still have to do.. that thing." the sand wasn't an issue for the teen at all, he always could've made new sand.* - Sun Nov  8 00:07:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) the clone looked up at Ai, whom was visible in the air above. The clone spoke, "It was fun toying around with cha'.. I'm going to see Ai." with that, the clone burst into sand, yes.. It erupted in a plume of sand." off in the distance, Tetsumi remerged from the ground below. Iron sand gathered below his feet, forming a dense platform of iron sand. The platform rose the teen up into the air, he traveled off in the distance towards the mental hospital that Madelyn was being kept at.* - Sun Nov  8 00:24:44 2015

Though it was only visible for three seconds, followed by dusty smoke. From the smooke, a large cloth was brought forth. 

Tetsumi channeled chakra towards the cloth while guiding said cloth towards Fujitora while the smoke distorted his vision. In doing so, he'd most likely be able to 'demonstrate' his knowleadge of fuuinjutsu so far.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mhmm... Soo... Focus my chakra into the seal of the scroll? G'otcha. Easy enough." the teen was very cocky giving the unsealing drill. Maybe a little to cocky. He'd reach out for the first scroll among the collection of seven.. With the scroll in his grasp, he'd focus channeling his chakra into the scroll attempting to unravel the scroll and the seal itself. Though the result of this, the only caused the scroll to undo itself, the fuuinjutsu markings on the scroll glowed for a moment but nothing happened.

"Ehh?..." the teen's left eye twitched. He knew Fujitora would say something, especially with how cocky the teen was before."Just calm down, analyze it all... Its like I'm reaching in for somethin'.. I got it." saying this to himself, the teen channeled more chakra into the first scroll that was still in his grasp. As his chakra danced along the scroll, it worked towards the seal fandling with it for a moment. He focused on allowing his chakra to seep into the seal and retrieve what ever was trapped within the first scroll. There was silence until, smoke was produced followed by whatever was trapped within the scroll being released from it. Was it water? Candy? A Rock? He wasn't sure, he'd find out once the smoke cleared.* - Sun Nov  8 07:33:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) tried to wave to Mirai once she greeted him but in doing so he'd drop his stack of scrolls.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Mmmm? Oh these." his eyes focused on the scroll within his possession, his hands were occupied holding, well bunching all of them together. "They're scrolls I have to unseal, If I can't do it.. I fail." he'd try to explain to Mirai while releasing a sigh.* - Sun Nov  8 08:00:25 2015
