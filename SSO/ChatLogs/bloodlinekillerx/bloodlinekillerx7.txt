<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) had enough at this point, he held it in for too long. As a manipulator he tried, he tried to build patience with him but slandering his name..Plus he spoke about the beast within, didn't people ever thought about his feelings or the beast? Annoying or not, he was a seperate entity and so was Tetsu. "People like you, you're the type that ruined my child hood.." with each word his chakra intensified, it became cold as the words he spoke, the iron cork undid it falling to the floor at the teen's feet. "The type that never understod, the type that snuffed the life of my grandmother, the type that labled me with out knowing. I have to regrets." 

his words died as iron sand erupted from his gourd, it went right through the cell for the manipulator. His eyes were cold for a moment, the sand itself quickly consumed the red head's body. There was a pause, probably about ten seconds elasped a moment for the manipulator to treasure what remained of his life. His eyes shut, it was closed off to the world as he shut his open palm. This action intensified the pressure in the sand until it imploded potentially killing him. Blood splattered mixed in with iron sand, it scattered about some of the blood even managing to stain the teen's face with the crimson liquid from the potentially deceased ex shinobi. "I hold no regrets." the teen thought, maybe it wasn't the best course of action? Maybe it was, who knew.* - Thu Oct  8 03:29:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shook his head, his sand returned to his gourd where he usually stored itself. The iron cork that once was on the floor levitated back into place sealing off the gourd from potential spills."It was, it'd prevent choas for the future and safety of the village. That one a top the bird earlier was another mistake, he too once was a shinobi of sunagakure." meaning sabo, though his words were true and he'd stick to his action and beliefs as well. Sunagakure had to thrieve in a positive direction, not like in Jak's reign.* - Thu Oct  8 03:44:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Since there isn't much to do around here..I guess i'll train." the teen thought before releasing a depressing sigh. He'd push himself off of the seat where he once stod, with any words to the group he'd leave venturing off for training.* - Thu Oct  8 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) ventured off in the direction of his training spot, that place was always peaceful. On his way over he'd notice the blade weilding female violet, for this reason he'd move some ways over from his original traning location. Once finding where he'd train for this session he brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body, forcefully he clapped his hands. This caused the iron cork on his gourd to slacken, a poping sound was heard as the cork flew into the air. It soon was greeted by a miniature eruption of blackened sand, this sand was concentrated out infront of the teen. 

The sand soon took form, it shifted molding into an extact copy of Tetsumi's identity, every detail of him even his sleepless eyes. More of the material ejected out of his gourd at a fast pace, the once arriving at the clone the sand began binding it, cloaking it in sand itself preventing movement. It first went for the clone's hands, then from his feet up consuming its being completely.

A few seconds passed, time ticked he had to improve on how quickly he executed his sand techniques. An open palm was extended outward aimed at the cloaked clone within the coffin of iron. The sand reeked of blood for some odd reason, forcefully he closed the open palm causing pressure to crush the clone from every possibly place of the coffin. The pressure rose and rose until the sand itself imploded destroying the clone, as well as sending the blackened material across the training grounds. An emotionless gaze was focused on the sand, at this time he noticed Beth approach, though he hadn't done anything as yet or reacted to the newcommer."Mhmm?" the teen questioned, a bit intrigued why someone disrupted his training session.* - Thu Oct  8 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) gaze shifted from the newcommer Trilliam to Beth's figure, in appearance he..well she looked like a male."Its a girl.." the teen thought in his mind, a bit shocked  though it was only her voice that gave it away, though he wasn't one hundred percent sure it was a female. His gaze ceased from the of them for a moment, a portion of the blackened sand retracted returning back infront of his figure. While that portion of the sand was recalled, a portion of the sand of what remained of the clone comprised of the material reformed out of it. 

A yawn was heard from the iron sand clone, "You can at least do better than that, Tetsu c'mon." the teen's stare intensified by just hearing and focusing on the iron sand clone. Swiftly the same amount of iron sand from before glided by, once again it repeated the same detainment plan, it was a patern in its own way. First a section of the sand broke apart rushing and binding the clone's hands, while the remaining sand began at its feet until it comsumed it entierly. 

Tetsumi's left hand was extended outward, his palm open for a couple of seconds. He tried to work out these kinks, delays in his techniques something he'd seen from the first man to obliterate his iron sand shield in combat, Zetsumo. His open palm closed forcefully, sending pressure through out the sand coffin increasing the pressure until it imploded. Sand was scattered about the area like rain in a sense, it littered the area his trained eye on the clone ceased as it returned on the two that deared to interupt his training..Maybe he should make it his training to catch these two with his sand, though it was only wishful thinking he wouldn't do it.* - Thu Oct  8 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) brought an idle hand up under and up to the side of his chin, he'd scratch slightly."Err...A couple hours? Lost track of time." * - Thu Oct  8 22:52:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "How about, we play a game?" his eyes shifted at the two individuals who were basically in his training area."How about, I try to catch you two with my sand. You both can do anything to try and get away, though once I bind you you're out...Seems fun enough? Doesn't it beat just staring at me train?" the teen questioned, he did find it a bit..odd that these two chose to stare at him instead of doing something constructive with their lifes.* - Thu Oct  8 23:06:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) stormed off from the village square, most likely no one would understand him nore the reason in which the jounin left in such a funk. He'd release steam from within, "Doesn't he even care about her memory?" the teen questioned himself, maybe that's what made him different? He held every memory of those close to his heart, dead or not intact. Why were other humans the opposite of this, it didn't matter shinobi or none shinobi. Most he'd met were like this, "Are all humans like this?" he'd shake his head in disbelief, there had to be some with light in their hearts still. 

The teen climbed a top an idle rock within the village of sunagakure, a top this rock he sat crossing his legs as well as closing his eyes, it was as if he was a monk meditating to achieve furher enlightenment. His breathing slowed down, his heart rate decreased meaning he'd calmed himself down a little. He hadn't been able to contact the beast in a while, maybe he'd attempt this feat once again.

Despite the beast's nature, he felt alone and it didn't matter to him even if he'd get yelled at, passed events thrown in his face, failures..It didn't matter to the teen, he longed for attention, companionship even? Then again, this may have been foolish. His hands motioned up to the mid-section of his body, at this point in his body he clasped his hands as he focused attempting to reach out to the beast. "Hey, Tanuki."

If he was successful in this the beast's dimension would come into focus, such a dimension or world that looked as if it contained royalty do to the golden floor of the plain, the ancient letters that binded him in his place, the usual look..Unless the place changed since he'd been here last, then he'd see something entirely different.* - Fri Oct  9 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) though this attempt to felt as if it was a failure. He didn't get a reply nore an invitation into the tanuki's world. * - Fri Oct  9 03:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) once receiving his mission briefing from Hassan he'd head out, he wasn't planning on wasting time. There was a mission to be completed, so he'd complete it as swiftly as possibly. He'd leave the village, a mask was produced from one of his many pouches around his waist. He'd gaze at the mask for a moment, it was the same mask he traveled on his journey with. Once more he'd equip the mask, his face was hidden. The gourd on his back shook for a moment, within it the material inside churned. The iron cork from his gourd slackened, this was removed as it momenteriely levitated in the air while the desired amount of the material slithered out of the gourd. The blackened sand lined itself over Tetsumi's clothing foming a hoodie out of the blackened sand, it looked so real it even swayed from side to as if it were alive, a trait the manipulator did himself..It was time to get to buisness.

The first of many mines under his village's control was one west of his current location.  That was the first of ore mines he'd visit. Though he didn't intend to travel by foot, it'd waste to much time for the masked teen. He'd clasp his hands gathering chakra, more of the blackened sand erupted from within the object that confined it. The sand formed below his feet, it became dense to support his weight before sending him off towards the sky, his destination the western mine.

Arriving at the western mine he'd notice workers mining away to obtain the ore that the earthern mountain yieded. "Mhmm.." his head went back and fourth examining everything about the place. This mine seemed okay, it didn't weild any threats to sunagakure, plus the ore hunt seemed to be fruitful. He'd take his leave. Where he'd left it, the platform of iron remained. Both of his feet were placed firmly on the platform, a strip of iron latched his feet down fastening him from potentially being bucked off. After this action the platform took over and traversed the dessert this time heading towards the southern mine. 

The platform lowered once the place came into focus, right outside of the entrance he landed. The strip of iron sand that binded his feet to it undid itself granting him mobility and freedom to utilize his feet. He'd look around again, this mine didn't yield as much ore as the previous one. Though the workers bickered amongst each other, he'd shrug his shoulders at least they were finishing up the work, right? 

He'd leave the bickering within slowly dying down the further he got away. He'd step on the platform of iron once more, it strapped his feet down before it prepared for lift off. The platform jerked skyward then forward in the direction of the eastern mines. It wasn't hard, especially with the map he was provided for the task at hand. It came into focus, though something caught his attention someone leaving the mine. The platform dipped downward hard and fast, it landed directly infront of the fleeing man. Both of his hands were folded, sunagakure's insignia etched on his gourd. The strip of iron that secured him retreated back into the platform as he dismounted from it. "Where are you going?" the mask teen question, it was obvious the man he questioned wasn't a worker.

//Myserious man, "What's it to you?" at this moment his eyes gazed apon the masked individual's gourd noticing sunagakure's insignia."Ahh I see. I was warning the workers here. The mine were I work at..its been seized by foerign shinobi."

"Mhmm.." he did seem shaken up, his clothing was ruffled up slight freash wounds. His story added up, the teen shook his head before yet again checking up on this mine either way. 

//The workers worked at double time, though they seemed a bit shaken up. Their voices seemed frantic, the chatter between them easily caught his attetion."W-What if they came here?!" the others individual replied, "We'll just leave..I have a wife and kids, its not worth it."

//Masked teen, "I see..i'll just have to take care of that." he knew if this proceeded it'd decrease the worker's moral and sunagakure would be in serious trouble. No one was going to prevent problems for sunagakure, he was determined to stop this threat. After leaving the mine he'd look in the escape worker, "Stay here, i'll look after your mine. You'll be able to return soon." with that he'd step on the platform of iron. A strip of iron secured his footing before he ventured towards the sky with the aid of his platform. The northern mine was his destination. 

The northern mine came into focus, from above smoke was seen from within."..Huh?.." the teen questioned, the platform lowered. He landed outside but to the side of the entrace, the strip of sand retreated back into the platform as he stepped off of it. He had confidence in his abilities though it was best he made a plan, he needed to know how much enemy shinobi there were inside and find out the best course of action quickly before any of the workers were injured or killed. He'd brought his left hand up to his left eye channeling chakra. As he did this iron sand formed out of what seemed to be thin air, this sand shaped itself into a mole. Its eye sockets were blank for a moment before its sockets were filled with iron sand that soon granted the mole sight. It looked like an ordinary mole, it dugg beneath the earth, his vision changed into earth being pushed away easily. It eventually dug towards the surface making a point of entry for it to emerge from, as it emerged the scene painted itself out. 

There were five foreign shinobi within, from them his sight focused on the workers. Three laid dead, while the others worked not having time to morn the deaths of the workers. It was a deperessing scene, one you'd see in a slave movie. One of the shinobi piped up barking orders, though he wasn't able to read his lips thanks to the smoke within distorting his ability to read lips properly, though he caught the man slapping a worker. The force knocked the worker to the ground, blood trickeled from the worker's mouth, as the worker's face came into focus it seemed as if it was a woman. Anger rushed through his being, "...They're dead." honestly he was going to defy hassan's orders at first, instead of killing them he planned to detain them and throw them into a prison. But actions like this, plus the bodies that laid on the ground..It was obvious they hadn't any remorse or care for human life or life in general, death was the only option for those five. 

The mole of iron converted back into iron, the jutsu was canceled and his sight was returned. He was once again outside of the mine, he'd retrieve two smoke bombs from his back pouch. These smoke bombs were thrown out from his grasp, they rolled along the mine's floor towards the shinobi's feet. "Huh?" in unison was heard as the smoke bombs went off, sending more smoke through the cave. This was Tetsumi's chance, a large amount of sand flowed from his gourd right into the cave while he followed behind. The figures of the shinobi were seen in the smoke, though bearly. It was time to corner each one of them, five clones exact formed out of the iron sand, each one for the shinobi causing havoc.

The smoke cleared up revealing himself, as well as the clones. Each clone stod stationed infront a shinobi,  One of the shinobi piped up"This isn't a place for children, you'll meet your end here." Each of the clones laughed, including the original. "Its funny you said that." the clones spoke in unison, though the shinobi didn't take kindly to this and tried to destroy each clone. This feat, they succeeded in...to an extent. The clones looked shocked, though they reformed being able to trap each shinboi's hand within themselfes.

"You were saying?" the original said, they fought to free themselves. One even managed to do this, he'd make handgesture trapping the others in the sand that formed the iron sand clone. A large portion of their body was consumed by the blackened sand, at ths time the lone shinobi that got freed raced forward. It swung a pickaxe at the teen's head, his sand raced forward forming a shield of sand above his head while launching him backwards a little. It was as if the man hit solid metal, the clashing of metal was obvious. His eyes flew open, "You're" before he even got to finish his words more sand gushed forward encasing him in its essence. 

A few more seconds passed, he hoped each of them reflected on the bad they've done through out their lifes. With that he forcefully shot his hand, a signal meaning the end. The pressure through out sand intensified until it imploded showering sand and blood alike across the cave. Workers screamed, horror evident on their faces. His job was finished, "You're all saved..no one will mess with you guys again." silently he morned the deaths of the workers before his sand returned funneling back into his gourd. He'd leave with out another word, he stepped on the platform, a strip of iron secured his footing as he raced towards the sky in the direction of sunagakure, his mission was complete.* - Fri Oct  9 06:24:51 2015

She's the medic after all, my sand with render her puppets useless." the teen seemed to be deep in thought for a moment, deductive plan in his mind while Sanoke and Koki did their jobs.

The sand formed below his feet becoming dense to support his weight, a strip of iron secured his footing. With the aid of his sand he soared through the air, the sand enhanced his natural speed he'd use this asset to catch up with the fleeing shinobi rather quickly than normal. 

While Sanoke attempted to utilize an unseen technique from his view he pursued to cut off their path.* - Fri Oct  9 19:26:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "You won't escape my sand." the teen voice seemed cold, he levitated from above aided by his sand. He had to react quickly or the daimyo's life would surely come to an end, he had to mercy for these individuals. An eruption of blackened sand was seen from above, it was enormous a bast gathering of the material from above.. It spread from above, hopefully sanoke would close the gap or fill in to he could've prepared his technique. 

The sky seemed to be dark over the individuals, danger crepted.* - Fri Oct  9 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widened as the man that carried the basket vanished from his sight, he was gone along with the basket. He cursed in his mind, the only people remained on the battle field was Megan, her puppets, Sanoke, and himself..He couldn't waste time fighting here, not at all. His voice bellowed from above, "Sanoke! Go after him, i'll handle her." Hopefully the shinobi followed and respected his call, he'd just have to deal with the female's puppets.

Anger welled up inside, more of the multiplied it continued to spread until its formation above changed into droplets of the material. It seemed as if the sky was raining iron sand, the blackened sand rained from above, it rained over Megan as well as the puppets summoned.

(Strategem Perk.) As the rain of iron sand continued he'd attempt to command the iron sand to get into the puppets joints making its useless. As it got into its joints he'd once again attempt to destroy the puppets, giant spikes formed from within the puppets, it erupted outward hopefully destroying the threats and sending parts that remained of the puppets about. It was all up to Sanoke at this point.* - Fri Oct  9 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) witnessed the incoming cloud of poison?"...Poison..." the child thought, his eyes widened in fear. He couldn't allow himself to be trapped in such a threat. On its own sand materialized out of what seemed to be thin air, the sand moved swiftly encasing the teen in the sand to prevent him from inhaling it. He sat in the darkness for a moment.

He'd brought an idle two fingers up to his left eye channeling chakra. An eye of iron sand formed outside of the shield that protected him, megan remained where she was in defeat. With the remaining sand about he'd attempt to bombard the woman in a furry of sand, it was a cyclone of the material swirling around her preventing escape. He'd be reduced to attacking like this until the poison dispersed from the air around him.* - Fri Oct  9 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widened in shock, he couldn't believe what he saw, besides this her abilities seemed to have increased greatly. "W-Wahh." the female rushed forward avoiding his intial attack, she neared his shield attempting to attack. He could've approached this differently, every plan in his mind had a different outcome. The moment she punched the shield it shuddered, his eye of sand dispersed.

"S-She's changed." if he continued to hide in fear, she'd eventually break through and kill him..The sand was a last resort after all, or was it truely? With the punch made he'd let it sink in some into his shielf of sand, the shield broke down at this time. The sand itself from the shield bombarded the female shinobi? puppet? Either way it raced forward attempting to subdue her, the blackened sand would conssume her body. If successful it'd restrict all of her movements trapping her within a coffin of iron. Maybe it'd hold?

He needed the buy time for the finishing attack.* - Fri Oct  9 20:36:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) aparent fear vanished, all trace of it. In all he was suprised yet intrigued with Megan's abilities. Despite if she ripped off a  large portion of sand, some would remain or attempt to reapply itself. Even if he hadn't caught all of her being with the technique, he'd crush something. The teen's open palm shut tight, it increased the pressure through out the sand that remained, the pressure intensified until her body or what was consumed by the material crushed, hopefully reduced to a liquified state, blood, oil, what ever remained of her now that she was mechanized.

Though, another threat was on the horizzon, his shield moved into action. Sand materialized wrapping him inside of its warmth and protection..The way a caring mother, or significant other would to brace the attack.* - Fri Oct  9 20:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) his entire world shook, the shield of iron sand vibrated harshly, it felt as if it was giving away. If this did happen, the last precaution would be activated. Though thank to the shield's durability it didn't gave way sparing him. The shield quickly crumbled, losing its shape and density. What remained of the mechanized puppeter? Nothing but a crater, was that all she lived up to become? He'd sigh, in his mind he prayed for her despite all she'd done.

"Time to help Sanoke!" the teen roared, the sand below his feet formed into a platform of sand that quickly took for the skies in Sanoke's direction. Most of the sand that laid about where also stored back into his gourd in preparation for the next battle.* - Fri Oct  9 20:53:32 2015

It looked similar to a fist worn with brass knuckles. That fist attempted to reach out to meet the threat's body causing potential blunt dammage as well as piercing  dammage from the strike.

(Strategem Perk.) though the fist was only apart of his plan incase all hell failed and he tanked the attack. The sand from the initial attack would bombard him, wraping around his fist first, then the rest of his body containing him in iron.

"I don't know where the Damiyo is, though Koji's out of it." as he said this the terrain changed, the sky clouds vanished, it became dark.."Danger? What the?.." the weather didn't change like this in sunagakure. Sand kicked up, his hands motioned out infront of himself to shield himself from sand entering his eyes. He wasn't aware this was a genjutsu, though it did seem fishy and strange, didn't they kill all of them? Either way, there was a path, he'd gladly take it if his comrades agreed.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) walked over to the guards at the gate, "I'll be back, need to scout the area." in truth he was leaving for training. He'd travel as far away from the village as he could, he couldn't allow the village to witness his training or be caught in the cross fire of such a technique.

He was far away from the village as possibly. The place was nothing but sand for days, no type of civilization near by, it was perfect. The teen clasped his hands gathering chakra, this chakra was converted into magnetic forces, ennabling his magnetic field. The cork of iron from his gourd slackened as it was removed allowing sand to flow in and out of it. Iron sand spewed out of the gourd, a decent amount of the material, enough of it to form four iron sand clones. These clones of iron stayed on stand by, standing off in the distance. 

Tetsu left all four clones alone, they waited alone in wait of whatever was to come. Off in the distance Tetsu concentrated, his hands were clasped while he gathered chakra. This gathered chakra was converted into iron sand, it took him a while. Over time more of the blackened sand was conjured, it double, tripled, it was a gathering of a massive amount of iron sand. After enough time elasped a massive wave of sand was produced from the fruits of his labor. He manipulated this rather large gather of sand, "Kronos." the teen thought, he'd made this technique in honor of this shinobi since he created a version to this technique out of sand. The iron sand raced along the sand, the clones were easily swepted up, being tossed and turned within the waves of the technique, there wasn't an escape unless they dispurst in sand. Though it was too much for the four clones, each were destroyed their essence adding into the supply of sand. * - Sat Oct 10 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) huffed and buffed a little, "This technique..it takes so much of my chakra. " he felt the toll the technique had. Maybe he had enough chakra for another assault of sand. Sweat trickled down from the side of his face, due to the heat and strain the technique had on him. Out of the iron sand that laid about four clones comprised of the material sprang to life.  They were back for more, he used those clones as motivation to press on. 

The teen clasped his hands gathering chakra, the large amount of chakra gathered was converted into iron sand. With each amount of iron sand conjured from his chakra sweat ran down the side of his face, more of the liquid were produced from his glands. It took him a while to a mass enough of the iron sand, it was a large amount of it..no massive amount of iron sand.

This massive amount of iron sand was willed and manipulated by the manipulator. It gathered, its form taking the shape of a massive wave of the material, a tsunami. It raced across the sand, cover a wide amount of space in its wrath. The clones waited, with this clones he'd also test out ways of escaping from the sand. The sand arrived at the clone's destination, it crashed into them, each one destroyed at different points. Its essence reverted back into iron sand itself, it joined with the massive amount of sand cover the area. There were destroyed cactus trees, and that was all, nothing else seemed to be destroyed or dying, wounded, you name it. Unless he killed something small enough that he hadn't noticed, oh that might've been a pitty.* - Sat Oct 10 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) body was forced to the ground, he'd be forced to take a knee for the moment. His hands shook for momenteriely, a smile etched on his face."Can't give up now, If I give up i'll be turning my back on sunagakure. N-Need to protect my land." his breathing was controlled once again. He forced himself to his feet, he swayed to the side almost losing his footing as well as his balance for a moment.

As he regained his balance a single clone formed out of the massive amount of iron sand. He smiled at the clone, he still had the will to go on. He wiped his face, a trail of sweat was wiped and flicked to the side of him, it was absorbed into the sand. A shaky hand was extended outward, the sand at the clone's feet slowly encased the clone in iron sand, from the buttom of its feet to the crown of its head.

There was a longer pause than usual, his gaze stayed focused on the encased clone."Almost..just focus." he'd end his training soon enough, he just needed to pull through. Every word that the beast said, along with others in the past doubting his ability, this helped the teen's drive. His palm closed, this sent a surge of chakra through out the sand, causing pressure to erupt through out it. The pressure soon caused to sand to implode sending sand about, it flew through the air scattering about. "I'm done.. I still need enough chakra incase there is an attack." you never knew what could happen, he still needed enough chakra to protect the village if anything happened. Out of the large supply of iron sand that remained, a platform of the material formed below his feet. A strip of iron secured his footing, the platform rose into the air after this it headed towards the village by air.* - Sat Oct 10 02:45:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) released a sigh before leaving Fujitora's side, at least one aspect of his plee may have been solved. Though he didn't see it happening, he'd have to put the matter into his own hands.* - Sat Oct 10 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) observed from a far, in the distance Ai was visible in the training location most likely training again."She's at it again?" the teen questioned in his mind. * - Sat Oct 10 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) brought his hands up to the mid-section of his body, there he folded his arms observing Ai's fighting style. Though he'd seen it before, it really looked as if the shinobi had improved her skills. He'd speak, his voice probably might've been drowned out by her training or not. Who knew, either way he'd speak "Why are you always out here alone? You could be training with Fuji or something. Its better not to be alone if you could help it, ya'know." he was speaking from personal experience, though he hadn't the chance anymore. Physical loneliness in this world was his path for the time being, though inside he didn't feel alone. 

Ai's reason may defer, he just was curious for her answer and resolve.* - Sat Oct 10 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) guessed she hadn't heard him, he'd shrug his shoulders leaving the training area. It was better he left her to herself and her training.* - Sat Oct 10 07:31:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..I guess that's just the balance of this world. - Sun Oct 11 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Sadly. - Sun Oct 11 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: But that's what makes it intresting I guess. - Sun Oct 11 00:28:09 2015
