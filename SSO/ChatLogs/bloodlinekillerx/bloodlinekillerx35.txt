Executed he'd draw in air, filling his lungs with oxygen. Wind natured chakra mixed in with the inhaled air, parting his lips he'd blow outward. The air he'd taken in, he'd compressed them into bullets of air, four in total. One after the other, the air bullets flew through the air, soaring forward at a fast pace for the tree infront of himself. 

The bullets of compressed air, managed to chip away wood from the tree.  Leaving hollow scars in the tree, he'd held back a lot power wise while training, he wanted to grasp the technique more after all.* - Mon Nov 16 10:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked up at the sky, the messenger bird had returned bearing the message from Kana. He'd nod his head towards the bird on recieving the letter, unraveling the scroll.. it simply said "Go to hell." he'd release a sigh, maybe he should 'Go to Hell', leave this world. He'd act upon this will, no one wanted the jinchuriki around, him or his identity as wasn't needed. 

Water formed in his eyes, tears trickled down staining the wooden floor in the apartment. He'd make sure no one was home, wearing a mask and a hood. He'd go to the weapons shop, and purchased the needed amount of explosives tags. With the amount of explosive tags purchased, he'd line the house in explosive tags, every inch that about twenty explosive tags could've done. Though the explosive tags lined through out the house, were all chakra detonated tags..

"I have no regrets." once the job was finished, he'd focus. Iron sand burst from the teen's gourd, it swirled together forming a durable drill that began chipping away at wood, it dug though the sand.  He'd brought two fingers up to his left eye, channeling chakra towards said eye. On the outside of the house, iron sand gathered forming a bird that looked like any common small bird found around sunagakure or in the village at times. The bird kept tabs on the outside of the house, time passed but he managed to dig through beneath the sands of the village and out another end away from the village.

His eye kept tabs on the house, concentrating yet again.. Iron sand formed, forming a look a like, a clone from the material. Everything about the clone, it looked identical, spot on to the original. The clone did as he instructed, he did it where local shinobi or civilians would notice. The moment the clone walked in closing the door, he'd set off the explosives with his chakra. A chain of explosives went off, igniting the apartment, setting the home a blaze in flames, sky high. Leaving no trace of Tetsumi Jiki, if they dared to find the jounin.

With the job finished, the bird flew away. What left of his lingering self, the shell of what he used to be.. Formed a platform out of blackened sand and took for the sky, vanishing from sight, probably not to be seen again. The villagers could rejoice as Tetsumi was dead, they were free at last.* - Tue Nov 17 11:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) sighed once leaving the village from his aparent death, "I have no regrets." he'd repeat while applying his armor he'd purchased from Marco."I'm no longer needed, the armor even came with a helmet, masking his facial features. The rest of the way, he'd travel by air until arriving at where ever his rue destination would be, it was a mystery to even the teen.* - Tue Nov 17 11:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) went through his bag, rummaging through it for supplies. Though, from the looks of it the armored teen was out of supplies. "Sucks, i'll have to stop somewhere soon to restock." he'd look off into the distance, everything for miles were trees... But to his luck he'd found a water source but didn't trust it much, "Its best I get my water supply from somewhere else."

releasing a yawn from within he'd continue with his travels, venturing where ever the wind blew. "Hmm.. Startin' over.. maybe it isn't as bad."he'd mumble while venturing through the woods, there was pep present in his step.* - Wed Nov 18 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Unknown Armored Figure glanced up at the walls of konoha, memories of his past life flowed through his mind. Behind of his helmet that masked his facial features, he'd smile a little but this sudden smile turned to sadness for some odd reason."Rest easy." he'd say while focusing towards the village's gate, everything he did was awkward, a mystery even.  

"I'll need to get intel on the village, find out if its safe enough. And, if it has the supplies I need.. Hmm." The armored individual brought his left hand up to his mask, about where the mouth piece was located. Removing this part, he'd hook it on to his armor, there was place upon it for this.  After this, he'd brought his left hand towards his mouth. His thumb stuck out, placing his thumb into his mouth he'd bite down, drawing blood. Blood leeked from his freash wound, he'd brought both of his hands up to the mid-section of his body, forming the required seals for the summoning technique.

Executed he'd place his hand on the ground, summoning markings were present, followed by smoke. As the smoke cleared, a small raccoon for reconaissance purposes was summoned forth from his world. Within his armor, he looked entierly different but the summoning creature would've recognized his voice and knew whom he truely was right off the bat. "I'll need you to search the village for me. Look for any signs of food, any potential danger, anything really. Report back when you're finished."

//Raccoon understod, "I'll be back in a jiffy." it spoke in a british accent, it darted away in a zig-zag fashion into the village.

This was the best option for him, he couldn't allow his massive levels of chakra being detected. As the raccoon left to do his job, he'd reattach the mouth piece of the armor's helmet back in its place, consealing those features off from the outside world.* - Wed Nov 18 02:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //raccoon returned to the armored individual once he'd finished gathering intel on Konoha. So far, it seemed dead.. Like a ghost town. "There doesn't seem to be a threat."

The barrage of punches sent forward, he'd dodged each and every punch easily but he made it look sloopy. One, to keep up appearences, two because the amor weighed down his body.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored individual stared up at the sky above, the sky held many colors in the distance.. This meant the sun was setting, it'd be dark soon. "Hmm.. I'll have to search the area again." this was something he had to have done, why? Because in konohagakure, a village with out proper leadership.. Criminals, bandits, rouges, and so on came as they wished, causing trouble and leaving hovic behind. He couldn't be caught up in any of this, not with his new life, this was his new page or chapter after all.

His left hand motioned up to the mouth piece of the armor, detaching the mouth piece, his mouth was visible. He'd brought his thumb up and into his mouth. With his thumb in his mouth, he'd bite down drawing blood. Removing the bleeding thumb from his mouth, he'd brought both of his hands to the mid-section of his body. There, he'd form the required seals for the summoning technique. Executed he'd kneed some chakra and place his palm on the floor.

Summoning markings appeared briefly, followed by smoke. As the smoke cleared, a small raccoon used for reconaissance pourposes appeared.//Raccoon picked up his head, examining the amored individual. "Good did, Sir." it spoke in a british accent, it wasn't the lazy usual one.. The lazy one from before didn't speak human's tongue, only raccoon's tongue.  But he still warmed up to that raccoon.

//Armored Individual"I want you to search the village, make sure no threats are around. Then return back here. If you don't return, i'll presume you've died. Go a head, I wish you luck."

//Raccoon eyed the armored individual done for a moment, "All right, Chap." with that, he'd dash throught the grass scouting the village.* - Fri Nov 20 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Hmm? - Fri Nov 20 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: HELLO SIR! - Fri Nov 20 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored Individual released a sigh, what was different about him from the last time Hachirou saw him was that, he lacked his mouth piece for his armor. His mouth was visible, in his mind he didn't want to fight. As Hachirou declared their death match and  jumped into the air his hands motioned towards the mid-section of his body. "I really didn't want to fight.." he'd thought, "Maybe I can reason with him." with these thoughts swirling around in his mind, he'd form the required handseals for the technique in mind. 

With the seals executed, he'd inhale air, filling his lungs with oxygen. Wind natured chakra mixed in within him, fusing with the inhaled oxygen. Though prior to the seals, he'd taken into account the general area around him, that's what good strategist did. His plan was to allow Hachirou to decend down a little, until at the right angle of the tree behind of him. Blowing outward, he'd released a strong sudden gust of wind. With this gust of wind, his intent was to send him crashing into the tree, hell probably even take the treee down in the process, knocking the two backwards.

Following this action, he'd form the required seal or seals to perform yet another technique! He'd channeled earth natured chakra into the ground, slamming his palm against the floor where his chakra channeled through out it. The ground lossened up growing weaker and damp, until he'd summoned a river of mud. This river of mud's intent, was to meet up with Hachirou the moment he fell, touched ground, or crashed into the ground. * - Fri Nov 20 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored individual's movement was a bit slowed, thanks to the armor he sported around."SHIT!" he'd cursed in his mind, a smirk was present on his lips. At this rate, it'd happen he'd end up blowing his cover."SHIT." went through his mind, as Hachirou plummeted from the heavens above, sword outstreched in hand. Out of thin air, a good amount of blackened sand, iron sand materialized out of thin air. The sand conjured moved at a fast pace, forming a shield stopping Hachirou's potential attack from the air above. Which meant, he'd be delayed there for a moment.

He'd reep the benefits of his down fall. "No one can know." went through his mind, he'd clasped his hands while in air. Wind natured chakra mixed in with the inhaled breath, infusing the oxygen taken in. At this time, Hachirou's blade broke through, it came for the teen he would be hit.. Blowing outward, he'd released a powerful gale of compressed wind. Blasting into Hachirou's body, combining with this technique, since he'd possibly already been found out. 

The iron sand in the air formed into ten shuriken, he'd pointed his fingers foward a gesture for the shurikens to propell forward. As they propelled forward, they were infused with wind natured chakra, increasing their over all speed, and ability to wound or kill. All of this, was aimed for Hachirou.

If he could've moved in time, he'd try to step backwards. If not, he'd still be in his same location prior to forming his seals and the start of the death match.* - Fri Nov 20 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) released a sigh from within, he looked down at Hachirou's body. It was soaked in a pool of blood."You shouldn't have underestimated your prey. But. I am truely sorry. I never meant for this to happen." his voice, with ou the mouth piece of his armor, it sounded normal.. Different than his voice Hachirou had heard in the past, it was his real voice. 

Behind his helmet that covered his face, their was sadness present. Kneeling down to the man's body, he'd search him for food. Or any useful things he'd needed, only food though. That's all he wanted, food. But with the amount of things he'd found, his eyes widened. "Why do you have that?..." the teen questioned, pointing at the Mizukage's hat.

He'd curse below his breath, "Shit. I have to move out!" he'd thought, why? He thought he was the Mizukage or representative, something precious to kirigakure His cover was blown, he couldn't be here any longer. Though, he'd wait.. Wait until the man took his final breath.. He wouldn't do exactly what he had in mind, with the man still alive.. He couldn't, he wasn't that type of person. Plus, the man did give him money before... before he decided to fight him to the death.

When Hachirou took his last breath, he'd bowed his head respectively. Channeling his chakra through out the area, iron sand materialized out of what seemed to be thin air, but he simply created the material out of his chakra. "Rest easy.. Thank You.. For being nice to me.." his voice was a bit sad, he'd thought he'd finally met and made a friend. The sand swirled around Hachirou's body, it formed into drills at every side of him.. Drilling away the earth, creating a deep grave for him. Once done, his body fell through, earth came crumbling down, crashing upon his body.  A couple more hand gestures were made, he'd shape the many dills into shovers, covering over the grave site with the misplaced earth from before. 

With his body hidden, he'd venture off away from the area. As fast and swiftly as he could, though he was far from swift in the armor he'd worn. He'd look back one final time, his hand motioning up to his face, the mouth piece of the mask in his hand. Attaching it back into its place once more, it hid his mouth once more, as well as distorting his voice, preventing it from being identified to his real identity.* - Fri Nov 20 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: His things... I'll have to burry that as well... - Fri Nov 20 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) made yet another hand gesture as he fled the scene, the sand that remained dug a hole for his things. The hole covered back over with his command, once everything was hidden away. The sand that was conjured, formed into a thin drill, it drilled into the ground, burying and hiding the sand from sight. Give a ways, signs of his past life.. He couldn't allow it to be seen, he wouldn't give any hints at all.* - Fri Nov 20 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Yup... He had to be from Kirigakure. *sigh* What a mess. - Fri Nov 20 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored Individual came whistling down the path, it was a weird tune.. It even sounded strange, especially as it was transmitted from his mouth piece of his helmet that cave off a funky tune. In the distance, he'd spot the blonde haired woman from before. His movements stopped, he wondered if he should've even tried to interact with the woman but he was unsure."It sucks being alone though.." he'd mumble below his breath, the voice was low but sounded a lot different and distorted thanks to the armored helmet.

His head dropped downward a little, staring at the ground. Taking in a deep breath, he'd lift back up his head, refocusing on the woman off in the distance in his sight. She was a weird one, from his sources it seemed she just stayed alone reading from a book, dark. Piping up, he'd yell in a joyful tone "HELLO MA'AM!" it was a joyful one but his voice probably didn't project the full lethality of the happiness present in his voice.* - Sat Nov 21 06:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored Individual brought his hands up to chest area, folding them. His eyes behind of his helmet looked Asteroth from head to toe, examining her throughly.

"Nothin' much, ma'am. I'm bored. Just checking on you, how are you today?" he tried to grab at any form of conversation he could've gotten between himself and her. It wasn't like he liked her or was attracted to the beautiful lady, he just was lonely and wanted to speak with someone... anyone.* - Sat Nov 21 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored Individual looked upward for a moment, at the sky. "Things.. don't go as planned." he seemed to have been deep in thought, before refocusing on the moody woman.

He'd walk closer to the fence ease of him, turning completely around with his back against the wooden structure. Leaning on it he'd smile behind of his helmet."You should smile sometimes, ma'am. If I was beautiful as you, I wouldn't be wearing this helmet, Hahaha!" he'd tried to crack a joke, attempts to lighten the mood around the woman.. He tried so hard to make friends, especially since the last... his faith didn't end well.* - Sat Nov 21 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored Individual grabbed his chest all dramatically, reacting to Asteroth's words."That hurt." his voice sounded sad, behind of his helmet he even pouted a little. But on the inside, he didn't care, simple chit-chat like this was good enough, he was used to less than this after all.

"Heh, I tried! Oh well.. But, there has to be something to speak about.. Umm.. Like.. What is that book about? The one you're always reading?" hell, maybe she could've spoke abou that, she did seem attached and drawn into the book.. It had to be interesting!!!* - Sat Nov 21 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored Individual lips formed into a silent smile, his head was kept forward as Asteroth spoke. 

"Fiesty." he'd thought hearing the book slam, that meant he'd stroke out at conversation in that department. With her question being asked, he'd nonechantly say "Don't know. A relic I guess." though, from this point he kept a her in his sights with this question... Was she on to him? Probably not."You want to know who I am, but I can't know about your book? Seems unfair, ma'am." he'd joke.* - Sat Nov 21 07:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Hmm? I should?.. Well, if It was a romantic novel.. Ehh.. I wouldn't know about romance anyway, I'd have left you alone. - Sat Nov 21 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored Individual came strolling back up the street, his step with chipper, happy even. Everything about the armored guy seemed cheerful, "Hmm.. Wonder if there is somethin' good to eat at that restaurant." he'd thought while continuing down the street. 

"Hmm?" once again, he'd notice the blonde from before, though he didn't know her name. Even after their two encounters, "HEY MA'AM!" he'd his left hand widly greeting the woman from a distance, in his mind he wanted to see how ticked off she could've gotten.* - Sat Nov 21 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored individual continued to stare at the female, he'd noticed the decline in her attitude, compared from the other encounters he'd had with her. Though from her, his eyes focused on the book in her hand, 

"No No. Its quiet here, so its nice ya'know. Not much violence, a bit peaceful. Its great here." he'd brought his hands up to his chest, folding them. He was obviously bored.* - Sat Nov 21 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored individual cocked his head to the side a little, "Ehh.. I guess you're right, I am a bit bored. But, boredom comes hand in hand with peace."

he'd pause, looking over the woman again. He was storing and processing information gained about the blonde in his mind, like a machine. He couldn't suppress the laugh after Asterorth questioned him abou the helmet that concealed his face, "I told you before, its because... I'M UGLY!" he said it with his own dramatic flare, the armored guy was a character it seemed.

"I hide from no one, except what people think of my distasteful features. You wouldn't understand, you actually was blessed with good looks." he kept his eyes trained on her, wondering what she'd say, her comback, anything.* - Sat Nov 21 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored individual smiled from behind of his helmet, he thought he'd gotten her distracted by talking about her looks.. Oh well, that failed and was taken off of the table, attempts to get her attention off of him."Remove my helmet? I'd rather not, I wouldn't want to leave you to my frightful looks.. It'd be a shame, cause you wouldn't want to chat with me anymore, if you'd seen my face."

He wondered how Asteroth would react to this, either way his thoughts seemed elsewhere.* - Sat Nov 21 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored Individual released a sigh, it was obvious Asteroth didn't buy his story, not in the slightest.  "Hmm.. You sure you're not that superficial? Its not you, but I'm used to others judging me.. Soley based off of my looks, ma'am. I just can't bring myself to remove my helmet."

he'd turn around, facing away from the woman. He'd keep hey partially in his sights though, he wasn't sure if she was capable of ambushing him or not.. He couldn't allow anyone to get the upper hand, as long as he could've helped it."I'll be going then, it was nice meeting you, ma'am." with that, the armored individual attempted to leave.* - Sat Nov 21 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //continued traveling towards sunagakure, he'd seen the massive army traveling while he hid. "What?... Why are there so many?.." the armored individual questioned, from where they were headed.. It seemed as if they were heading for sunagakure. "Damnit.." he didnt know either to help or not. He was having an internal conflict, but he'd think on Izanami and his other sliblings."No... They can't be hurt, no.. Never.. Not Iza. I'll protect them."

he'd wait for the army to gain a further distance away from his location while devising a plan. While the amy traveled, he'd brought two fingers up to his helmet, channeling chakra. While he did this, blackened sand materialized in the air, forming into a bird that resembled a sunagakure's bird. It flew above the army, gaining intel on how many soldiers it might've been, from there the bird continued to travel while he persued from behind.* - Wed Nov 25 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored individual continued to look through his bird's own sight, by now it looked over the battlefield. Gazing at the many battles that were raging on, "...Shit...." it looked intense, his body trembled a bit while he gazed upon the many deceased shinobi from both sides. "No.. No.." he'd clenched his fist, seeing so many deaths.. Guilt began setting in, jelling into his mind, he felt as if it was his fault, he was responsible. 

"...No....No.... Izanami, where are you?" he couldn't find his sister, and knowing her she'd be somewhere fighting. She wouldn't let her home be overun like this, left to suffer. Somewhere along the sand, he'd spot his sister, but it was a gruesome sight. She lacked an arm, she was bleeding out. Anger set in, "N-No..No...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" the bird looked around a little bit more. Taking in a wider view, there were more deaths.. Of shinobi he'd known, one in particular sent him completely off the edge, tumbling down.

His promise he'd made long ago, it echo'd through out his mind. He'd failed, "Edge..." images of many deceased shinobi flashed through his head. No, not from only this battle but Zetsumo's reign.  From behind of his helmet, the helmet of his full body armor, tears trickled down. 

He'd make a decision, In his mind he called out. As he did this, his hands flowed, motioning up to the mid-section of his body. "Shukaku, I'll make a with you. I know you love killing, blood... Everthing about it, I want you to kill EVERYONE that opposes sunagakure, kill as much as you'd like. All of that fun, while you're free. Do this for me, just keep away from sunagakure shinobi or try to avoid killing as much. That's my deal.

//Shukaku heard Tetsumi's plead. "Heh. I'll take it, THE OPPORTUNITY TO KILL HUMANS?! I CAN'T GIVE THAT UP." While saying this, he'd brought Tetsumi into his inner prison, facing the teen down a bit skeptical.. It didn't seem like him, this incident really had to have shaken his host.

//Tetsumi looked up at the tanuki, "Thank You, Shukaku." while saying this, he'd formed the needed seal to tap into this form... This peak, this peak of power that gained him access to shukaku's full formation, the beast's true look. "Edge, I'll never forgive you with Amu's death." with the seal executed, he felt sweet sleep sweeping over him. It was nice, the thought of Amu stayed on his mind as slumber took over him and he was wisked off to a land of sleep.

A massive amount of iron sand was released from the teen's body, iron sand It consumed him, the sand formed limp by limp, body part to body part, until it matched the tanuki's entire look. The tanuki laughed, its laughter booming through the area, "ITS TIME FOR BLOOD!" in the distance, the tanuki made out of iron sand utilized the sand from the general area. It rolled backwards, forming a massive wave on wave of sand, until a tsunami rolled backwards, washing over his body a bit. Extended both of his hands forward, a tsunami made of the dessert's sand was sent forward, attempting to kill some troops of Edge's forces in this attempt. A top of the tanuki's head, an armored individual laid there sleeping in peace, clad in his armor.* - Thu Nov 26 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Shukaku enjoyed every moment of this, many shinobi of the opposing side Edge's side were burried beneath the sand of sunagakure. "HA!" his voice boomed over the battlefield, he'd look left and right, gazing upon the battlefield. He simply scoped out the battlefield, trying to identify as much of Edge's troops as possible and try not to kill sunagakure's troops. 

The tanuki thought of a plan, a plan that would equally satisfy his lust for blood. He'd attack in more than one direction at the same time. He was simply toying with the humans on Edge's side, as well as getting adusting to his growing power. The Iron tanuki took in a deep breath, drawing in a great amount of the air from the surrounding area, filling his insides up. With his right hand, he'd pound his stomach, opening his giant maw he'd release a highly compressed air balls from its mouth. It were multiple of them, in rapid succession. One ball was aimed for one section of the troops, ball two for the other, ball three for the other side of the Edge's troops. On impact, the giant balls of wind exploded dealing an enormous amount of damage, as well as levelling anything in its path.

On top of the beast, the sleeping armored individual layed there, partially visible slumped over. If one could see his face beneath his armor, he seemed at peace.

//Shukaku voice boomed through the teen's mind, waking the sleepy head up."Get up, before I change my mind. Tch.", all the while he said this, his physical body in the real world was falling apart. The armored individual that was partially visible among it, fell through the sky, though his decent was soft cushioned thanks to the sand. 

///Armored Individual, while deep within his mind. He'd smile from beneath his helmet that covered his facial apperance."It was nice.. for a last time, ya'know." the beast's world coming out of focus, the real world around him blinding him a little.. It was a good nap.

//Armored individual looked around, countless nameless deceased shinobi was scattered across the sand's of his old home."Iza.. I hope you survived." with his last actions, he'd remove a scroll from the pouches around his armored suit. Unraveling the scroll, he'd withdraw another tool, a pencil! He'd placed the pencil in his left hand, scribbling a couple things down. Witht he letter completed, he'd make a signal while sticking out his arm. A black feathered bird flew down from the heavens, as it perched on his extended hand he'd present a scroll to it. "Deliver this to sunagakure... This'll be the last thing I do.. for them." his time was running out, he had to go.

The bird flew away, towards the village. Delivering a message saying "Live on Sunagakure, Izanami... Even in death, I'm looking out for you." a couple of tear drops were visible on the scroll scattered about in various locations.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //armored individual was seen whistling while walking up the path, the whistle came out sounding weird.  Though this was caused by the mouth piece of his armor, it distorted the sound and natural voice of many things.  He'd look around while whistling, he was a bit sad he hadn't seen his blond female friend that always seemed to be in a bad mood. His head continued turning looking, his while as well as his head movement ceased the moment it landed on both Tengoku and Abraxas. These two were new faces to the armored guy.

There was silence until he decided he'd speak, his voice was chipper but distorted by the mouth piece. "Hello! How are you two?" he'd ask, trying to make slight conversation, it was rare to see new faces in konoha. Especially since the last new face tried to kill him, youch.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) bend his head downward slightly, behind of his helmet he'd smile a little."Stupid weirds.." he'd thought while advancing forward towards Rias."Fine us somewhere private then." was the only thing he'd say, his left hand was held outward waiting for Rias's hand and lead.* - Wed Dec  2 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored individual watched as Rias undressed, he'd slightly turn away. Below his armor the teen was getting hot. But tried his best to fight off this emotion, just glimpsing on Rias's body.. He had a closer view of it, though the puzzle wasn't complete. Meaning she wasn't completely undressed. 

He'd walk over towards Rias, the clanking of his armored was heard as he approached. "Are you sure you want to do this?" the armored guy asked, his voice still distorted. If she said, yes and was possitively sure... He'd undo a couple of unseen hinges to his armor, it came apart and he'd remove his helmet. Every part of his armor was placed on the side, out of his way and out of sight.

His facial features were revealed, they were the same from the last Rias had seen him. He'd remove his shirt, shoes, and pants but his boxer remained. Nearing Rias, he'd attempt to pull away her panties and bra. If successful, he'd stick out his tongue. From her breasts, he'd slide down his tongue, stopping one inch away from her clit. Teasing the woman. 

From there, he'd message her breasts, paying mind to her nipples especially since her breasts were very large. So large he couldn't completely wrap around them. While messaging her breasts, blood flowed to his penis increasing its size slowly. The boy was getting hot, horny, aroused. 

One of his hands, his right moved away from one of her breasts. His mouth begining to suck on her breats, alternating between each one. His tongue rotating around the nibblles especially, they were juicy. His free hand slowly moved downward, playing with rias's clit. "Pretty, even looks better than Madelyn's." he'd thought while continuing his acts.* - Wed Dec  2 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) layed back on the bed, he'd look at the ceiling. At this point, thinking about what he'd just done. But he was too tired think in-depth about it. Instead, he'd just smile slightly relaxing.* - Wed Dec  2 10:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) //Armored individual walked up the street, pep in his step as usual. Though he'd stop in his tracks once noticing someone up the path. "Ehh?.." he'd question while his eyes looked him up and down examining him."Eh.. Maybe he's not a threat." the armored guy thought, from there he'd continue his whole chipper guise.

"HELLO THERE!" the armored guy was waving wildly while hoping from one foot to the other like a kid trying to get the teacher's attention.* - Fri Dec  4 05:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) blanky stared at the man, was he focusing on him or staring off into nothing? It was weird, he'd shrug his shoulders though still weary around him. He hadn't known him and usually people that he hadn't known tried to attack him on various occassions, though he'd keep up his cheerful attitude.

"Oh? FORTUNE READ? Are you.... a MAGCIAN...Wait.. that's wrong... I think it was a fortune teller... ehh...." he'd scratched the back of his head nervous, behind of his helmet that hid his facial features, he had a nervous smile present. "Or... a Lucky Charm... How about both?!" his voice sounded chipper, despite the mouth piece that distorted his natural voice slightly, deepening his voice in the process and making it a bit more audible.* - Fri Dec  4 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) continued to stare at the man, his stare held for about three seconds before he dashed forward like a little kid being offered candy. "Okay... What do I need to do?!" the armored guy asked, he looked energetic waiting for Byakuren to give him an answer or show him.* - Fri Dec  4 05:43:53 2015
