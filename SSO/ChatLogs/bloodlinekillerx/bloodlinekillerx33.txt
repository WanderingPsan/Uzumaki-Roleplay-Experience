<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: Sand vs Paper... - Sat Nov 14 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) observed as Ai scattered about, the same as before. It was difficult for the teen to pin point Ai or how many papers this possibly was. A smile formed on the teen's lips, at this same time paper folded together forming a few paper blades."Shit.. This'll be a challenge, have to react fast." with the blades formed, he'd went through a couple of handseals. Executed, he'd inhale air. 

As the teen inhaled air, wind styled chakra gathered mixing in with the inhaled air within himself. As the paper swords made their moves he'd parted his lips, blowing outward he'd release a sudden strong gust of wind attempting to blow away said blades of paper. As well as proceed upward attempting to make the surge of wind made contact with the paper above.

As the wind was released, he gathered chakra, the said chakra was converted into magnetic forces enabling his magnetic field. With its activation the iron cork on the teen's gourd flew off, an audible 'pop' was heard was once released. A large amount of iron sand erupted out of the teen's gourd, the blackened sand flowed into the air around the teen, as well as inhabiting the ground or sand around the teen. Though he didn't do anything, he just watched waiting for Ai's move while taking mental notes of the situation.* - Sat Nov 14 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) observed as Ai used the wind from his technique to enhance her own weapons. "Nice.. But don't underestimate me." saying this, from the arc that the weapons took, they'd either come at him from his left and right side. This wasn't good for him at all, making use of his reflexes he'd jump backward while shaping the sand in the air around the teen.

The iron sand formed into ten shurikens out infront of the teen, he'd clasped his hands. As he did this, he'd inhaled more air filling up his lungs. With the inhaled air, wind styled chakra gathered and multiplied within himsef. Parting his lips he'd exhale blowing up a powerful gale of of wind from himself. With the wind natured chakra flowing through his iron sand shuriken they'd enhance there lethality, enough for the plan he had in mind.

He'd direct the shuriken at either side of himself, or where the bladed weapons would've striked him. The wind styled enhanced shurikens sped forward at the blades, attempting to cut straight through the paper bladed weapons easily. That's where he uped his power a little in success of said action.

It this was successful, the ten shuriken enhanced with wind styled chakra raced upward at the many scattered paper around, attempting to cut through them until the real Ai emerged once more.* - Sat Nov 14 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) didn't even notice the long blades behind of him, it seemed like the teen was screwed. On its own, a portion of the sand from his gourd raced behind of him at a much faster pace than Ai had ever seen from their previous sparing match. The iron sand quickly and swiftly deflected the long bades. While they were held out infront of the teen he'd execute his plan giving the circumstances.

His hands motioned towards the mid-section of his body the moment the bladed weapons were deflected by his shield of sand. Executed a gust of wind was released from Tetsumi sending sand about,  while several small tornadoes of wind kicked about. The tornadoes of wind swirled around the teen at first, the several tornadoes intent were to trap the paper in the air in its vortex, hell even trying to catch Ai attempting to trap her in this torrent of wind styled jutsu.

As he did this, he'd form ten more shuriken out of the sand in the air around him. With the shurikens formed, they'd raced forward attempting to use the tornadoes power to enhance its speed, as well as use this opporunity to shred the many paper  potenially trapped?* - Sun Nov 15 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Hmm.." was heard from the teen as he looked above, it seemed that Ai was in the teen's hand. In more ways than it seemed, with Ai trapping herself in protective paper he'd seize this opportunity rather quickly. Though there still was room for this plan to backfire on himself.  

A large portion of iron sand, from the ground around him, as well as the iron sand in the air raced upward. He'd make a hand gesture as the sand raced upward. Though he still had a good much of iron sand left in his gourd, he wasn't leaving himself entierly vulnerable. 

With the hand gesture made, the sand in the area surrounded Ai's dome, it formed a dome of iron sand around the paper defense, trapping her within it.  With Ai trapped, he'd form rotating blades out of the sand within the dome that trapped Ai, whom was within another dome. About ten rotating blades began cutting through the paper guard, attempting to reace to the core of it, Ai.

Though he had another plan, incase Ai somehow escaped this. But he wouldn't reveal his trump card as yet, he wondered how Ai would counter this. Especially since she was in the palm of his hand and escape was a difficult thing to do, giving the situation.* - Sun Nov 15 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) watched as an opening was visible, he was intent to exploit this end the match at this exact time.. But a bird flew through the sky, infront of the teen it dropped a scroll. Bending down, he'd reach for the scroll as well as unraveling it. The message was revealed to him, his eyes widened."..Shit..." shifting a gaze upward he'd exclaim.

"I HAVE TO GO!" saying this, he'd recall all of his sand. The sand that was formed in a dome around Ai returned to him, it funneled back into his gourd.. Every grain of the blackened sand returned."I'm sorry Ai.. I have somewhere to be.." with out another word, he'd attempt to leave the area.* - Sun Nov 15 01:46:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Saw this guy restrain that monster thing...Marissa..and that cum eye'd girl... - Sun Nov 15 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) watched with his arms folded across his chest region, Mana made the first move. His eyes widened seeing how fast the girl was, "This'll be fun." he'd thought as the female dashed forward into him, leaving nothing but a trail of sand behind.  While she came at him, he gathered chakra, the gathered chakra was converted into magnetic forces, enabling his magnetic field.

As the field was activated, Mana was range she'd throw a punch forward at the teen's throat. On its own, an audible 'Pop' was heard as the iron cork flew upward, releasing an eruption of blackened sand, iron sand. It was a large amount of the material. With it released, a steady stream of the material formed a rather dense shield infront of him, blocking the attack while keeping Mana at bay out infront of himself.

At this time, Mitsunara took this opportunity at a chance at attacking him. Her body decended downward from above, juding from the angle she'd attempt to slash at his shoulder. Though what was strange to the teen about her intial attack, the blade expanded mid swing, a young child was visible pressing down on the blade. "That's bad.." he'd thought, his sand reacting on its own, attempted to raced upward at a fast pace to slow down Mitsunara's strike from above. Though, it'd still break through his shield.

Utilizing the time the shield gave him, he'd dash backwards, sliding against the sand. At this time, Mitsunara would've came crashing down probably sending sand about. It was his time to retaliate, his hands motioned towards the mid-section of his body as quickly as he could do it. Forming the required seals for the technique in mind, he'd inhale air. Wind natured chakra formed, gathered and multiplied within himself. Parting his lips, he'd blow outward releasing a sudden gust of wind at the two. This attack was meant to push the two backwards, as well as kick up sand in the process.

A smile was visible on his lips the moment the wind was released, it was time for a combination. He'd a small portion of the blackened sand form the air into ten senbon, the senbon raced forward into the wind natured chakra. In doing so, the senbon's cuting power and speed was increased. These senbon raced forward for both of them, five each, five for Mana and five for Mitsunara. Though they were manipulated, and not aimed for either of their eyes, but for their chest or leg region.

A smile was visible on the teen's face while more sand flowed into the air around the teen, sand even began to flow on to the ground around him. But the true intent of this wasn't clear as yet, unless the two figured it out.* - Sun Nov 15 08:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Hmm... She's gone." the teen thought noticing Mana vanished, she probably even avoided his combo, that was a shame. Despite this, Mitsunara capitalized in this moment, she continued with her attack. On its own, his sand raced forward to stop Mitsunara out at front, probably a tile away from Tetsumi on approaching him, though her strike would pierce through his sand, allowing her to come in for him if desired to.

While focused on Mitsunara, Mana took this opportunity to surpise him with a sneak attack. She burst from the ground, attempting to kick him behind of his head. On its own, another portion of his sand in the air, raced forward forming a solid shield of iron sand to defend the teen from the kick.

He had both of them where he wanted them, utilizing his reflexes he'd quickly jump to the left of himself away from Mitsunara's attack as well as Mana's failed attempt of a sneek attack. With Mana in the air or decending at this time, he'd make a hand gesture, sand from the ground around the teen flew upward bombarding the airborne or decending Mana. The sand would attempt to consume her body from his legs to the crown of her feet, attempting to consume her in a coffin of iron sand. If that worked, one threat was down for the count.

His eyes focused on Mitsunara, the very sand from her feet slowed down her movement if she attempted to proceed and strike him or didn't. The sand from the ground, as well as the sand in the air sped forward at her. Aiming to bombard into her hands first, while more sand bombarded into her body in an attempt to comsume her body in iron sand, restricting potential movement at the same time.  It was the same thing he'd attempt to do or had done to Mana.* - Sun Nov 15 09:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: If I can just get one hand on him... - Sun Nov 15 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Fast!" he'd thought as Mitsunara swung her blade at the last moment in a crescent moon-shapred arc. Iron sand from the very air around him moved quickly, in no time it formed into a wall of sand infront of said swing... Hell if it weren't for the sand protecting him, he'd be in some real deep do do. Though her strike probably would've broken through, reacting quickly he'd make a hand gesture, prompting another layer of sand to form, erected from the sand at his feet. The sand formed into another wall of sand, hopefully enough to stop said slash from wounding him.

As he did this, he'd make another handgesture, to make sure Mitsunara was caught this time for sure. More iron sand raced through the sky, swirling around Mitsunara. If she wasn't caught, the sand would attempt to detain her. If she was already caught, the sand would simply swirl around her.

Though the sand around Mana kept in place, keeping her in the coffin of sand that detained her, robing her of her movement.* - Sun Nov 15 09:21:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) blinked twice, he wasn't sure whom Mitsunara was talking about. Either way, he'd make a simple hand gesture. This caused the iron sand from both Mana and Mitsunara's bodies to fall, crumbling away to the ground below the two.

"Oh.. That's what she meant." at that same time, a chuunin approached the teen, informing him of Yan's arrival and aparent arrest."Late as usual.." he'd mumble toward the chuunin as the lower ranked shinobi left.* - Sun Nov 15 09:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) waited on Mitsunara to approach, as she did he watched her blade.. That was the main focus while battling her, though he didn't expect her to use that off of the bat. As the same  boy from before materilized, his eyes widened, the blade expanded. From his gourd, a stream of iron sand rushed upward forming a wall of sand to protect the teen from potential harm. Though, her attack would probably break though.

Moving backwards, his hands motioned towards the mid-section of his body forming a single seal. That was all he'd probably be able to do with Mitsunara to near to him, swinging her blade like a maniac. With the bird seal formed and executed, he'd inhale air. Wind natured chakra mixed in with the air within himself, multiplying. Parting his lips, he'd blew outward releasing fast compressed multiple bullets of air at Mitsunara's mid section. Two of the bullets were aimed for a mid-section, while the other two bullets at her sword weilding hand. 

The force from the air bullets probably pushing her backwards as well. But he toned down the power a lot since it was a spar after all.* - Sun Nov 15 10:01:10 2015

He'd have to resort to his other defense, iron sand layed on top of the teen's skin enhancing his defensive capabilities. The sand would act as extra support to protect him.

"Don't underestimate." With Mitsunara in close, he had her where he wanted her to be. His hands formed a single seal, the bird seal. Executed he'd inhale air, the inhaled air was infused with wind natured chakra. Parting his lips, he'd blow outward releasing four compressed air bullets. Two bullets aimed for the sword, hopefully knocking it away from Mitsunara's grasp, while the two other air bullets were focused towards her mid-section attempting to push her away, getting him some distance as an added bonus. If Mitsunara noticed, the force of the wind bullets increased from the last.* - Sun Nov 15 10:19:05 2015
