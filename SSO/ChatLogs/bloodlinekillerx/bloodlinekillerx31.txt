<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) removed a scroll from his pouch, he'd send a surge of chakra through out the scroll. The scroll unraveled, smoke was produced as a gourd was revealed. The gourd he'd lift up, placing on the gourd he'd make a hand gesture.

"I'm finished with this village." he'd announce, his sand burst out of the gourd flowing below his feet.  The sand became dense, forming a solid platform of sand below his very feet. Once done, the platform soared into the air, its whereabout or route? It was unsure.* - Wed Nov 11 23:41:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) while in the air above sunagakure, a portion of sand flowed out of his gourd. That portion of sand formed into a clone of himself, the clone too traversed through the skies on a platform of sand. The clone headed outside of the village it seemed by air. While the real Tetsumi decended below, once on the ground he'd landed right infront of the Ryujin manor. Turning the knob to the door, he'd head on inside closing and locking the door behind of him.

While inside, he'd use calmness of the room to calm himself down.* - Wed Nov 11 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) heard the sudden 'bam' at the door."What the hell?.." the teen questioned while walking towards the door, he'd open the door right away, prepared to snap at someone.* - Thu Nov 12 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "What the hell?.." the teen thought as Midora was dashing away, a trail well patches of marijuana left in her wake..."Y-You little!" the teen persuited the female once more, dashing after her, once again his movements were slowed down thanks to the armor he wore.* - Thu Nov 12 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) hands dropped back behind of him, the armored teen running stance dropped a little, he'd begin to run like a real shinobi. Though he probably wouldn't catch Midora, she was too fast for him on feet especially with the added weight of the armor.* - Thu Nov 12 03:06:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued forward like an idiot it seemed, he'd clasped his hands as he approached Midora whom turned around.. He didn't like this, but as he clasped his hands he gathered chakra, channeling it to the ground below.* - Thu Nov 12 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "W-Woah!" the teen stammered the moment Midora dashed forward instead of going backwards. The moment she did step forward to confront him, iron sand matterialized at his feet. Though because she confronted the teen so quickly, he didn't have time to shape the platform correctly and ended up surfing the san forward into Midora's figure. The result of this? He'd slam into her, both of them were forced to the ground below, unless she was quick enough to avoid it all.* - Thu Nov 12 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I-I've.. finally g-got you..." the teen groaned while trying to move off of Midora. If allowed to get up, he'd attempt to help her up off of the sand.* - Thu Nov 12 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widened as his hands were clasped with her own, alligned together. "W-Wah a-" he couldn't finish his words, he'd be tugged forward, his face submerging inbetween Midora's breats.."Oh.. she wants to play that game, huh?.." thinking this, he'd nestle his head in her breasts, from left to right. He'd then attempt to remove hid head from her breast, his hands held tighter trying to keep their hands clasped. 

"Oh? Did you really have me?" a cocky smile was visible on the teen's face.* - Thu Nov 12 03:30:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I'd say the same, but you're about to lose!" the teen was cocky, but he wouldn't follow through with what he had in mind. He'd leave slowly release his grasp on Midora's hands, both of their hands coming loose."Well, that was fun." he'd attempt to turn around and walk away from Midora.* - Thu Nov 12 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Oh well. - Thu Nov 12 03:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) face was red, though since he faced away from Midora hopefully she wouldn't see this. He'd release a sigh, "Its.." he didn't know what to say, honestly a lot of things went through his mind.* - Thu Nov 12 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Hmm... I.. didn't expect that. - Thu Nov 12 03:45:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) turned back around, he'd turned on his heels facing Midora. "You wanted more, right?" a nervous smile formed on his lips, his left hand reached out for her own."Since you're so eager, let's see what you've got."* - Thu Nov 12 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: (That moment Tetsu is a dead ass virgin and winging this shit.) - Thu Nov 12 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widened a little, his body pulled into hers, pressing against her chest. Though, he couldn't feel the best of it thanks to his armor. Armor of to protect one's virginity, gooo!! 

"Oh daring? I guess so." with his free hand, he'd place it on her ass.* - Thu Nov 12 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: How daring... do you think I am? - Thu Nov 12 03:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) smile quivered, he'd remove himself from their embrace. His left hand guiding her over towards the house behind of her. If allowed to, he'd open the door to the house and proceed inside.* - Thu Nov 12 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Daring but.. What should I do?.. - Thu Nov 12 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'll follow Hassan's books!!! - Thu Nov 12 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) guided her inside of the house, his face red. He didn't know what he should've done in this predicament, but he'd try to mimic the information Hassan passed on to him. Though, he only read about three chapters and hadn't finished the book. He'd let loose of Midora's hand, his hands motioning towards the straps that undid his armor, until he finally undid it all. 

Once the armor was undone and removed from his body, he'd place it to the side of the room. He didn't feel like sealing the armor back up at the time. His clothing underneath the armor was revealed, it was his normal wear. A blue shird, and black pants. His left hand reached back out for Midora's hand, attempting to guide her off to the side. A wall would've been behind of her, he'd push her lightly into the wall, stepping forward he'd allign his body with hers. 

Their bodies were in tandum, his right hand motioning towards her ass, messaging it gently.* - Thu Nov 12 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: W-What should I do next?... I'll have to remember everything from the book so far.. - Thu Nov 12 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) gulped hard, even she noticed that he to was a newbie to this, he couldn't fool anyone."Yeah.. I'm new to this too..." he tried to make eye contact with her, body his eyes drifted off elsewhere. His hands would attempt to slowly retract to his side, despite if he wasn't experience and a newbie.. The feeling was there, his body was reacting off of lust. So much, that his friend below had woken up, it gently nudged Midora, well where every was near to his area.

Embarassed, he'd attempt to step back away from Midora, his face red with embarassment.* - Thu Nov 12 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: What.. was I even trying to do?... *sigh* - Thu Nov 12 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Oh no.. That happened... S-Shit. - Thu Nov 12 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) face burned hot as he was brought back towards Midora's body, once again the teen was in her embrace. His body moving on its own at this time, both of his hands positioned at Midora's waist. From there he'd attempt to remove her shirt or jacket? Stripping her down to her bra, moving away from her body he'd hold her hand guiding her into the room behind of him. As the two entered, he'd close the door behind of him.

Guiding her over to the bed, he'd sit down on the bed. He did this so he could try and match her own height.  His hands would reach out, attempting to fundle with her breasts. As he did this, he was turned on even further. It was visible on his face now, even below.* - Thu Nov 12 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I-I won't give up as yet... - Thu Nov 12 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Oh? You like that?" his nervous grin came together. He stop fundling her breast for a second, his hands went to her bra strap undoing it. Once done, her bra would've came free, revealing a clearer picture of Midora's breasts to him. He'd gulp, his head leaned in alligning with her breasts. His mouth opened, he'd suck on her breast, his tongue rotating around the nipple, while his free hand played with the other tit. He'd even transition over towards the other bossom, utilizing his transitionist perk!* - Thu Nov 12 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: She's really sensitive... - Thu Nov 12 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) looked up seductively, while continuing to suck on her breast. With his tongue, he'd notice Midora's nipples were stiffer than before.. It was weird to him, did this mean she liked it? Pulling away he'd smile, the buldge in his pants was more apparent.  Honestly, he didn't know what to do after this.. He'd just embrace Midora, his arms wrapping around her pulling her closer. As he did this, he didn't expect he added weight to be this much and fell backwards on the bed, Midora on top of him and his buldge continuing to poke her.* - Thu Nov 12 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) laughed, "Hehe, its o-okay." one of his hands were wrapped around his waist, whie his other hand played in her hair. "You don't have to." plus, from her yawn he knew she was tired. It was late after all.* - Thu Nov 12 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) says: G'night.. - Thu Nov 12 05:20:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) made the best out of the opportunity he had before someone found either of them here. He'd just rest on the bed next to Midora, cuddling with the teen.* - Thu Nov 12 05:31:56 2015

//Shukaku grumbled, "WHAT?!" his voice boomed through the teen's mind, the darkness that wrapped around his mind was bathed in light for a moment. As the light dimmed down, he stod before the beast. As usual, the giant beast was behind of his cage of ancient lettering."What.. do you possibly want, kid? Oh.. Are you going to let me out? If not, SCRAM!"

//Tetsumi winched a little, as the beast spoke his clothing swayed from left to right for a moment...

I'm here to make a deal. W-" though, before the teen could explain the deal he heard a voice in the distant penetrating this world. 

It sounded like Chikyu's voice, he'd release a groan from within himself."I'll be back." slowly walked away from the beast, the further he walked away, the more the inner world within his mind vanished severing the link between himself and Shukaku.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) continued to glare at Chikyu."I don't s-" he didn't finish his sentence, his body tensed up a weird sensation coursed through his body and mind. All the while this happened, Rias's body fell limp on the sand next to the once medtitating teen.

As Rias ventured into his mind, someone else sensed the change. Before she could've gotten settled, someone or something spoke from within. //Shukaku peered through the dakrness of his cage, a massive amount of chakra erupted through out the teen's mind as his voice boomed, "GET THE FUCK OUT!" as he did this, he'd most likely force Rias out of Tetsumi's body.* - Thu Nov 12 18:43:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //Shukaku voice boomed through the teen's mind, "AND YOU! GET THE FUCK UP, KID!" 

Tetsumi in all, he witnessed parts of it, it was as if someone was over shadowing him. "Hmm?" he'd look up at the tanuki that came in his view."Hell you mean, get up?"

//Shukaku sighed, "You're an idiot... NEXT TIME SHE COMES BACK IN HERE, I'M COMING FOR YOUR HEAD AS WELL!" and with that, he'd kick Tetsumi out of his sight as well, restoring his outlook on the world around him.

Opening his eyes, he'd stare at Rias."......" he'd slowly get up off of the sand below, dusting himself off a little he'd slowly walk off away from the area.* - Thu Nov 12 18:59:12 2015
