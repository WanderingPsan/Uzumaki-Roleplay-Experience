A large portion of the matterial rushed forward bombarding into Reguel's figure, it had the blunt effect of the technique as well as the binding effect.

An iron cork was placed on top of it afterwards, this sealed off the sand from escaping."You might've gotten me with the technique if you used it sooner." though he knew in his heart that was highly doubtful since his sand protected him against his will, surpised or not it would've protected him.* - Mon Oct 12 07:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) recieved the mission scroll from Hassan, a slight nod was seen from the teen after he'd vanished in a swirl of iron sand. At a safe isolated location he'd sit down to go over the briefing for the mission within the scroll. He'd unravel the scroll, the contents within it unvealed itself for the jounin, it read.'Be at the execution sight at sun set, you have to execute a criminal.' 

The teen's heart dropped, a sigh was released from within."An execution? Great.." the teen mumbled with sarcasm hinted. "What could've this person done for it to come to this?" the teen questioned himself. Though it couldn't be helped, if he was a criminal it was his job on this mission. For him time moved so slowly, the sun didn't begin retreating from the sky above, it still was scorching hot for the teen. Though the heat given off from the sun seemed to decrease some."Mhmm..Its almost time."

Tetsu walked over to the execution sight, it was high above the village so everyone could witness the death. It was a way to distail fear from it as well as showing the repercussion for such actions. For the execution he dooned a black robe, his gourd was worn strapped to his back. As he walked down the isle it felt so gloomy, on lookers watched with hate. He had to have done something really bad to spark so much hatred in the various villagers standing by.  As he neared the man a smile formed on his dry lips, "So you'll be the one to end my life, heh.. I had a good run."

The robbed teen questioned the man, now the sun begining to retreat from the sky above."What did you do? For it to come to this?" the man replied, "As a shinobi..you have to make hasty decisions. You'll learn with age, at least.." as he said this he looked up at the sky "I'll be at peace and aplogize for my actions to them." 

The sky was losing its reddish lush from the sun, the light was escaping, he wasted to much time standing by chatting."I hope.." the iron cork from his gourd slackened, it fell to the ground as a steady flow of sand seeped out. It became wrapping around the man's body consuming it enterily from the buttom of his feet but haulted at his neck."I hope you find who you're looking for on the other side." a gastly smile was left on his face before the sand continued to spread across his body consuming hin in a coffin of death enterily. The light from the sky was retreating, a cloud formed above it seemed heavy..Was the sky filled with emotion as well? His hand closed causing causing a serge of chakra to run through out the sand, pressure ran along the sand nothing but raw pressure."I'll make this quick for you, you won't feel a thing." the teen thought as the sand imploded, he used just enough force to reduce him to a liquified state. Blood rain about, the sky yielded as it cried. 

It was raining, the sand returned to his gourd, nothing but managled body parts remained. There wasn't nothing else for the teen to do or stick around for the aftermath, an iron cork sealed off the top. His mission, despite how gruesome it was, was complete.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "All right, this will be a taijutsu drill!" within himself he tried to figure out what in the world..What was he even trying to do? Maybe this would give the young kunoichi something to do rather than sitting around idily doing nothing. The iron cork from his gourd undid itself as it fell towards the sand to the side of him, a steady flow of sand flowed from within it, it swirled around the teen's figure. 

One portion of the sand shot forward, it stoped and gathered infront of Nina. Its form changed taking on the apperance of Tetsumi himself. "I guess you could spar against this.." the clone waited with its hand folded across its chest, if she tried to dispell it she'd find it quite..annoying and dense. In short it'd probably hurt punching it.* - Mon Oct 12 21:36:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Good, impressed. At least you didn't gave up. But..How much of that will do you have to push yourself through?" the teen questioned, the iron sand clone was now destroyed, it reverted back into a pile of iron sand. He'd make a hand gesture, this caused the clone to reform out of the same material from before, no dammage, nicks, no visible dammage was seen on the clone's figure, it remerged ready for round two. Its same smile remained on its face, its sleepy eyes looked into Nina's own eyes."Should I make this a little bit more intresting? Heh, I think I will." the teen thought in his mind, he'd wait for the kunoichi's move and try his best to counteract. He was a strategist after all.* - Mon Oct 12 22:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) was amused by Nina's moves, she was really skilled in Taijutsu..He hadn't seen that type of skill in taijutsu ever since his mother kastya..The form of fightining stance she took, yup it was the same fighting stance she took, though Nina's punches lacked as much force and strength as the 'White Demon' Kastya.'

The iron sand clone to the right of Nina was punched, though it hadn't despersed as she'd intended. Her hand would yet again be stuck in the clone's body, though she'd be able to retract her hand easily. The other clones woud've closed in, though she'd be sucessful in getting away to retreat to catch her breath. "Think from your experience so far dealing with the clones, learn from it." the strategist tried his best to get Nina to see this, if she did she'd be able to analyze situations in real battle much easier.* - Mon Oct 12 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..She's pretty good. - Mon Oct 12 23:10:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) smiled as each one of his clones were destroyed by Nina's wind styled technique, "She'sc catching on quickly." the teen thought, each clones were reverted to a pile of iron sand. "Nice. I guess i'll make this a little bit more difficult." with that said, another portion of iron sand was released from his gourd. It moved to the side of whar remained of the destroyed clones, all portions, or patches of iron sand molding forming four clones in a single line, each clone with that goofy smile worn on their faces.

Clone number one would dash forward, its destination a frontal approach. 

Clone number two would dash to the left breaking from formation aiming for Nina's left side.

Clone number three would dash to the right trying to overwelm her from the right.

While lastly Clone number four would dash around the other clones, if all attempts to inclose her not would be successful or a failure his intention was to get behind of Nina, blocking off her path of escape as well as overwelming the nine year old.

Tetsumi watched impatient, wonder what would be her course of action.* - Mon Oct 12 23:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) allowed each clone to be dispersed, each one meeting their ends crumbling and converting back into iron sand. "Good, you've won." the teen gave the kid a thumbs up, every grain of sand returned to Tetsumi's gourd. "I won't continue this, you've proven yourself." he'd turn to Susumu, "Ehh..." was all that was heard from the teen's figure.* - Mon Oct 12 23:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) understod the mission at hand, it didn't seem as difficult just a simple round trip to the ore mines accompanied by three genin. "Doesn't seem that difficult." the teen mumbled to himself, though in truth he knew this'd be a lot difficult especially with commanding three genin..those three would be his responsibility. Either way, maybe he shouldn't have overlooked this, it was 'C' mission afterall, right?

Tetsumi met up with the other three genin for the mission, their was a female, she seemed to be about one year younger than himself, and two other male's about that age. Tetsumi would've approached the three a bright smile formed on his lips. "I'm Tetsu, i'll be the leader for this mission. What are you three names and professions? After this we'll be off.

All three of them introduced themselves and listed three professions, the female was a sensor, one male was a kenjutsu specialist, while the other was a puppeteer. Recieving this much he'd be off, arriving at the gate he'd speak once more."From here, we'll be traveling by air. It'll be much quicker and i'll be able to protect you three if things get a bit..intresting." the female looked amazed about flight, while the two males didn't care much and thought the shinobi had lost his mind.

The manipulator smiled, the iron cork on his gourd undid itself as it fell to the ground. A steady flow of iron sand seeped out of his gourd, this sand gathered below their feets forming one single platform of iron sand. It became dense, each of of their feet were strapped down by a strip of iron, a precaution so they wouldn't fall if anything happened. The platform raised from the ground below, it soared through the sky accompanied by the three genin. 

Their first destination was the north ore mine, arriving there the strip of sand released their binded feet, all four of them headed inside himself infront. His eyes jetting from left to right. In all the mine was safe, the workers did their various jobs. "All right, let's get a move on." with that all four of them soared towards the sky searching all the other mines he was specified to search. All of them checked out all right, "...Maybe it wasn't that difficult?..." the teen was lost for words, maybe the geezer was just a bit up tight about potential rouges attack or danger in the matter. 

They'd attempt to leave the final ore mine, as they did the female sensor's ability to detect chakra went hay wire. She'd yell to the group, "DUCK, ENEMY SHINOBI!" with that an explostion rang off at the mine cave's entrance. It was fast yet swift, there was a bright red light before it consumed the area. His sand went into action, but only protecting himself from harms way. All he saw was darkness, himself consumed in nothing but darkness."Am..I dead?" the teen questioned, he'd reach outward touching the cold durable iron of his shield."No..Those three!" the shield that protected him wouldn't go down, he'd brought two fingers up to his right eye channeling chakra. On the outside an eye formed, molded from a gathering of iron sand particles. As the eye formed it gained color, what ever the eye was able to see Tetsumi witnessed first hand. 

Boulders were blocking off the entrance/exit of the cave, one of the genin were injured, the puppeteer utilized his puppets to survive the falling debree but doing this he tried to preserve the sensors life by throwing her out of harms way. She was on the outside of the cave, four rouge shinobi appeared on the scene their voices carried from the outside world to even in here."You're the only one that survived, sad. You'll be reunited with those three soon." though he hadn't known what was going on, neither did he want to find out.. Those three were his responsibility.

Bulky hands formed from various locations in his shielf of sand, it extended outward. The boulders and depree were focused towards the entrance blasting an opening for the three of them. His shield of iron sand flowed back into his gourd, a section of it was left behind. His view was clear, "Look after that other gein, i'll take care of the enemy." the section of iron sand left behind formed into ten shuriken. This gathering, cluster of ninja stars flew through aiming to deal some dammage though he expected another outcome. He just needed them to get away from the sensor.

"You're crazy! You can't take all of them on sir!" the genin cried out while he tended to his other teamate. Tetsumi on the other hand didn't care, he wanted to protect them, like the village and villagers he went on to the beast about. Each attempt was a failure, he tried to do everything with his own power, the beast didn't care so he'd pull the weight. Even if he possibly died, it wouldn't matter once the genin survived.

he managed to push the rougue shinobi away from the sensor, "If I hesitate or underestimate any of em'..It'll be my death, heh..I can't die as yet." a large amount of iron sand erupted from the teen's gourd at a fast pace. Before any of the rougues could've reacted they were binded. The sand slowly consumed them, a cry of terror escaped their figures. Once consumed enterily, he'd forcefully close his hand sending a surge of chakra through out the iron coffin. Pressure built up until it imbloded sending chakra infused blood scattering about.

"Okay, we'll clear this mean th-" as he said this a pile of logs were visible from one of the coffin of the shinobi."W-Wahh?.." before even he could react a shinobi appeared utilizing shunshin, he'd punch the teen by passing his shield of sand sending him flying backwards. Though to brace the attack he'd revert to his armor of iron. This he didn't manage to destroy, though it was a pretty damn good hit, the armor crumbled away.

"Mhmm..You're good." since he couldn't deal with the rouge's raw speed, he'd revert to his shield of sand. He manipulated a good cluster of iron sand, forming a dome of iron sand protecting himself. The man dashed forward, his punshes working on the dome easily, it would soon crumble away leaving Tetsumi vernable.

A smile was etched on his face, he'd been in a predicament like this one before. A plan formed in his mind, iron sand spewed out of his gourd. As it was expelled a clone was formed out of the material, it moved infront of Tetsumi, while the teen moved to the side. The shield of iron sand gave way, a punchflew through it went straight through the clone. The clone looked shocked, adding to the ploy and surprise of the next attack. He'd close his hand sending pressure through out the sand that trapped his hand, crushing it completely. As he did this every grain of sand washed over him like a way further consuming him. His body would be consumed, trapped in a coffin of iron sand. Once more he closed his hand causing the sand to implode. Blood washed over the area, "Finished.." after this, he'd check on each one of the genin. After this checked out, he'd clear the rubble and debree from the cave's entrance. Seeing as that much was finished, he'd leave to transport the genin back to the village. He'd be sure to infrom hassan of the events that lead up to one of the genin acuiring a broken hand and a briefing of the attack and deaths of the four rouge shinobi..* - Tue Oct 13 07:10:56 2015

This village for starters, the beast's power had already demolished konoha though he didn't feel any guilt towards that event.. They did kill Amu, one of the last people that held on to his sanity..what made him stable, at least he still had Izanami, she was an imbodyment of kastya's will, hell she even looked like his adoptive mother. 

But he was determined to overcome his fear, master the beast's power. Something that even his mother the 'White Demon' couldn't, it was power that drived most crazy, made them lose themselves. He wouldn't give in or faulter to the tanuki's game.* - Tue Oct 13 08:39:40 2015

Each one of them seemed happy, for a second he invisioned himself in the younger child's position, his two parents, Gintoki, and his wife there a happy family. But it all vanished and the family that were there in reality continued on their lifes.

A single tear flowed from his left eye socket, the platform rose landing above the house. The platform broke down and flowed back into his gourd. He'd sit on top of the roof, feet crossed, eyes closed while his hands motioned up to the mid-section of his body. His hands came together, a gentle breeze passed by drying his tear away. In his mind he called out, "Hey Tanuki." it was the nature of all beings..maybe it were just humans. The heart wanted confrontation, something that kept him wanting to connect..change things even between people, though on the outside he'd failed everytime.

If he'd gotten the Tanuki's attention his vision would have warped to the Tanuki's dimension, one that looked like a prison comprised of ancient lettering of some kind. Though he wasn't sure how much the place changed from the last time he visited, maybe it wouldn't have changed as much or at all.* - Tue Oct 13 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) ventured around the entire village, to him it felt dead. It wasn't even night, he was used to staying up by himself training while everyone slept. But it felt different today, "Weird." he'd continue his journey around the village, an entire lap but there wasn't nothing. People were in the square but as he approached them he was ignored. "...Shinobi...." it was ironic, he was a shinobi himself though he didn't put himself in the same league with them. "Maybe people needed space.." he was in denial, loneliness was obviously there but his cure for this he'd think of the memories of those that were precious to him that were now deceased. He shouldn't dwell on the past but these memories were happy ones, memories that filled him with pourpose and joy.

The iron cork from his gourd removed itself, allowing for a steady flow of iron sand to seep out. This steady flow of iron sand formed below the teen's feet, it became dense forming a platform of iron that would grant him flight. He soared up towards the sky, he'd notice his house or what used to be it before it was rented in the distance. A new family lived there, it were the memories that drawed him in. The platform of iron neared the house, in the window he noticed the family sitting down at a table having dinner. Each one of them seemed happy, for a second he invisioned himself in the younger child's position, his two parents, Gintoki, and his wife there a happy family. But it all vanished and the family that were there in reality continued on their lifes.

A single tear flowed from his left eye socket, the platform rose landing above the house. The platform broke down and flowed back into his gourd. He'd sit on top of the roof, feet crossed, eyes closed while his hands motioned up to the mid-section of his body. His hands came together, a gentle breeze passed by drying his tear away. In his mind he called out, "Hey Tanuki." it was the nature of all beings..maybe it were just humans. The heart wanted confrontation, something that kept him wanting to connect..change things even between people, though on the outside he'd failed everytime.
