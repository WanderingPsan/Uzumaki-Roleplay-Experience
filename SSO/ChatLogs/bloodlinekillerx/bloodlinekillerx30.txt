Yes, this was the second time the teen was trapped in a nara's technique. His movements were out of his control, he tried to resist but couldn't. With his arm extended outward, his hand opened up resting right on Midora's chest.  Once there, he'd be forced to give it a squeeze, 'honk honk'.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) remained quiet, his eyes were closed while he stod. He was there at the moment, but he wasn't there at the same time. In his mind, deep, deep down, the teen was facing off with the Tanuki."You really should allow me to sleep for a change.. Its annoying at times." These words were focused towards the Tanuki, he stod up looking up at the beast.

//Shukaku "You could always sleep, I'm not forcing you to stay awake." the beast's voice boomed, but it was his normal tone.

//Tetsumi sighed, "Yo-" the Tanuki looked elsewhere for a moment. On the outside, Rias was senseing him, taking note of his chakra probably? This he wasn't aware of at all. He just was thrown off by Shukaku.

Rias would notice the teen had a high amount of chakra, the depth of it probably was unknown to her still.

//Tetsumi pointed at the Tanuki, "HEY!!! *sigh* Since you're distracted I'll see you around." saying this, he'd wave at the beast, the tanuki's world getting further out of his reach and sight.

He'd open his eyes noticing Rias, "Oh.. she's still here?" he'd thought while looking around the area.* - Wed Nov 11 10:36:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) scanned the area once more, he'd stretch a little while tip toeing. He'd wave to everyone before leaving the area. Maybe he'd go pratice somemore in the Ryujin manor.* - Wed Nov 11 11:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: See you all later. - Wed Nov 11 11:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) opened both of his eyes, the teen was always awake, just simply meditating. He'd push himself off of the mat underneath his buttom, his body swayed a little as he stod. Why? Because the weight of the armor still was something the teen had to get used to, regaining his foot and center of gravity he'd slowly approach the door.

At the door, he'd peep through the peep hole carved into the door. Looking through he'd notice a red a head at the door."...What the hell are they here?..." the the teen mumbled while unlocking the door. In the door way, he'd get a clearer view of Rias, he was unphased.* - Wed Nov 11 20:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) expression was blank, plain even. He had half a mind to slam the door in Rias's face, then proceed to himself deep in his mind again. But he decided not to, why? Because he wouldn't hear the end of it, his eyes shifted from his eyes, to her breasts for a moment... Then to her pen and paper, "To talk? *sigh* A'ight." he'd point towards the table in the room, around the table there were scattered mats or pillows (can't remember what Fuji had on the ground) around the table. 

"We could speak there. Close the door behind of you." after saying this, he'd walk over towards the table, his buttom easing down to sit on the mat or pillow. Though he sat down a little bit too hard, it shook the ground around him a little, his armor clattered.* - Wed Nov 11 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) blinked while looking over at the red head, "I'm an ex shinobi.. Nothin' more I guess.." he wasn't comfortable about telling someone about himself. It was an awkward thing for him, though as Rias sensed the teen.. She'd find the teen had a really large amount of chakra. The feel of it was strange, like wind that couldn't find its right path, the path to blow towards for example.* - Wed Nov 11 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) glared over at Rias as she spoke, he found it as a threat. Even though she most likely didn't mean it as a threat at all. "Why is she so happy?.." he'd thought while staring at the red head for about three seconds or more. He'd lost almost lost count, "Hmm.. What do you need to know?" he'd ask, his hands were folded across his chest area.* - Wed Nov 11 20:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm.. - Wed Nov 11 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) really wanted to impress Fujitora with his progress, especially how attentive he was about the whole fuuinjutsu thing, as well as how quickly he completed the task. From Fujitora he'd refocus on Rias, "Every detail about every kage... as well as every battle?.." he'd look towards the table that was covered in unsealed items. "I don't like, looking back on those battles. But i'll tell you as much.. About the past kazekage..."

There was a pause before he spoke, "The first kazekage was Lord Jak... Cool guy, he battled with a fan.. Powerful wind styled shinobi, also the first legal kage... The Second was Seto... I.. fought against him in the past but.. he died young trying to take the Gezo's exam to legalize sunagakure. The third.. Kastya, my mother. She.. was very strong... In more than one way... But she died to as an unlegal kazekage.. Next up... Tategama... If I remember right, he used wind style as well, good strategist. But died as an unlegalize kage as well... Next up.. Chiyari.. Honestly, I don't know what happened to him, he up and vanished. But he was blind, good fighter either way. Still an unlegalized kage... Finally, there is Hassan, which is a legal kage.. Though as I said before, he wasn't from the land of wind."

with this much information disclosed, he'd wobble to his feet. It was the weight of the armor, "Maybe... He may know better than me?" honestly, the teen was pleaged by memories of the past.. Remember every detail for detail about the past, it made the ghosts of the past return from the grave... A grave that he burried and intended to keep there, there in the past.* - Wed Nov 11 21:17:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "You won't escape my sight!" the teen thought, he kept running while his left hand motioned up towards his left eye. He'd closed his eye while placing two fingers over said eye. As he did this he'd channeled chakra towards the eye, out of thin air iron sand gathered above himself and Midora. The sand shaped into an eye that observed from above, "This way, even If I can't.. Keep up, I'll find her!"

Honestly, he could've just made an iron sand platform and catch her.. But, he wanted to get more used to his armor. The added weight of it, it made his movements a lot more sluggish than usually.* - Wed Nov 11 21:56:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "Yeahh... I don't think I'm catching her.... Plan B.." he'd thought while running, it was obvious he wouldn't catch Midora at all.  His eye continued to track Midora down, he'd begin to channel chakra through out the sand below as he ran. 

Eventually iron sand matterialized, created from his chakra. An ability, he rarely showed.. He didn't have a reason to, he had his gourd of sand those other times. Though with his armor training, the gourd would weigh him down even greater, he didn't need the extra weight at the time being. Below his feet, he'd accumulated enough iron sand. The iron sand below his feet formed into a dense platform of iron sand, the platform rose into the air a little. It gained height, not to much height while persuing Makoto.

"You won't escape..." his face turned red out of embarassment, just from thinking about what happened in their first encounter.* - Wed Nov 11 22:08:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) levitated in the air above, aided by his platform of iron."Hmm? You yield?" a thin smile stretched across the teen's face, he'd finally caught the prankster. The eye that protrolled above, burst back into grains of sand that trinkled down towards the ground below. "I see..." though he hadn't made him decent back down towards the sand below.* - Wed Nov 11 22:16:44 2015

And..." he felt as if a bullet went through his chest, why did people try so hard to hurt him? The platform of sand landed on the ground, the moment it did he'd point toward's Shira. The iron sand from the platform formed into an arm that raced forward, the arm would attempt to grab on to Shira's mid section. If it did, it'd prevent him from using his arms as well as restricting movement for him..

"Lock him up." he'd wait for someone, one of the shinobi arounf the area had to have worked at the jail. He was sick at people ruining his rep, it was already smudged from his past, he didn't need any added filth to it.* - Wed Nov 11 23:12:12 2015
