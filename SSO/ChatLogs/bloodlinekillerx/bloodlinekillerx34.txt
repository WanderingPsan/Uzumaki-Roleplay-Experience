<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) breathing became heavy for a moment, looking up towards the sky he'd think on somethng that calmed his nerves. With what ever that calmed his nervers in mind, his breathing returned to normal, he'd refocus on Kana.

"No. I'm not finished. Cause you're going to listen for a chance. I'M SICK OF YOUR DAMN DON'T CARE ATTITUDE! LISTEN FOR A SECOND, A'IGHT?!" the teen had lost his temper, he couldn't take it any longer, her attitude really got under his skin.

drawing in more air, it wasn't a steady breath more uneasy.

"If I didn't care, I wouldn't be wasting my time here." he'd attempt to grab a hold of her hand. Which probably wouldn't work, two things would come of this action. One he would be punched, two she would pull away, punch him, stomp on his nutz, and kill him, and embarass him some more. It was a risk he was willing to take.

"Just listen." he'd ask if he got a grip of her hand.* - Sun Nov 15 19:52:32 2015

It fell towards the ground as Iron sand slithered out, he'd make a hand gesture, prompting the iron sand to form a large hand. The large hand of iron sand raced towards the wall, its fist clenched punching a clean hole through the wall with ease. 

With the new exit point created, the iron sand funneled back into his gourd. He'd simply attempt to walk out of the hole, leaving. It wasn't his house after all, he didn't care as much.* - Mon Nov 16 04:16:51 2015

This bird dipped for a moment before flapping its wings once more, it'd fly upward regaining its height to monitor the village. 

Simply scouting for Kiyo, whom he wanted to speak with.* - Mon Nov 16 04:27:05 2015

The original, eyes widened at this moment shocked. The bird flew by, noticing its facial features... It was spot on, was this really Kronos? Though, there were a few things odd about him. The old attire, and cracks in his face..

"W-What in the hell?.." the teen stuttered, the bird continued to fly away from his child hood friend. "How?.. How is he alive?.." memories of the manipulator's death flew through his mind, memories of earth spikes piercing through his chest, killing him. 

Though, he didn't act rashly. The bird flew away for the time being, maybe as Kronos gained distance, the bird would return to monitor Kronos.. How was his friend alive? This was the mystery that plagued Tetsumi's mind.* - Mon Nov 16 04:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) eyes widened from his real location, the moment Kronos raised his hand, sand from the area began to rise up."SHIT!" he wasn't sure what Kronos had in mind, but he had a few ideas.. He couldn't allow him to attack the village or the guards, what was up with Kronos? Why was the man acting like this?! Why was he alive?!

Iron sand formed below the original Tetsumi's feet, forming a dense platform of iron sand. With the iron sand platform's creation, he'd soar upward towards the sky, over the village, in the direction of the village's gate."SHIT!" ran through his mind as he raced through the sky, it was a race against time at this point. 

Since he probably couldn't do much until he'd arrived, he'd try to distract the man for the time being.. Even though it may have cost him his eye on the skies above, the bird flew into Kronos's body attempting to smash into him.. Maybe it'd hault him, or even delay him from what he had planned.

"What's even going on?"* - Mon Nov 16 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) //bird failed in distracting the man, though it seemed as if he wasn't going to attack.. The man's own platform of sand raced through the skies, from the path he intended to travel, probably the village's square? 

Either way, he would've blocked the sand manipulator's path from within the sky. His hands were crossed, his eyes trained on Kronos.."Kronos. How are you alive?" the teen asked, he was probably four spaces away from the man but projected his voice so he could've been heard from the sky above.

He wasn't intent to leave Kronos get by, not with out an answer.* - Mon Nov 16 05:28:32 2015

A large amount of the material, he'd simply make a counter clock wise spin of the sand storm, attempting to subdue the sand that tried to sneer his sight.

If freed, his platform raced forward at a fast pace. "GET BACK HERE!"" he'd exclaim, a large amount of iron sand molded together, forming a large hand that extended outward to attempt to grab a hold of Kronos's mid-section. Hopefully this'd stop his earth bound friend.* - Mon Nov 16 05:46:27 2015

"So be it.." he'd thought, he'd form a string of handseals. Executed, he'd draw in air filling his lungs with the air from around the teen. With the inhaled air, wind styled chakra mixed in with the inhaled hair. His lips parted, blowing outward he'd released a sudden gust of wind at the clones, as well as Kronos. Why? He wanted to knock the man out of the sky, ans potentially destroy the clones of sand.

With the wind released, more iron sand raced forward attempting to catch Kronos where every he off to this time. Hit or miss, the sand was seeking for Kronos's body. If the large amount of sand collided with his body, it'd began to restrict his movements, incasing him a coffin of iron sand.

"I won't allow you to leave, I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS TO ASK!"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) sand raced forward on its own, at a rather fast pace. The sand moved infront of the drill, forming a durable wall of sand infront of it quickly. Using this time, he'd control his platform to make a sudden dip, moving downward away from the explosion. If any of the blast caught him, his shield would nullify it easily.

"WHAT THE HELL, DID I SAY?!" as his voice thundered in the air above, a large amount of iron sand flew upward, covering a large amount of the area above.

{Stratgem Perk} Once the large amount of iron sand spread above, he'd morph its shape into blackened drop lets, like rain. It wasn't lethal, but held another value out of this tactic. The iron sand droplets began binding the sand manipulator's body, as well as mixing in his new sand body. Why? trying to slow him down, as well as binding him tight, preventing escape.* - Mon Nov 16 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "His body keeps reforming out of sand, I can't..." though, he kept up with the drizzle of sand, it slide off, seeping into his body if possible. Despite even falling from above, he'd will the droplets of iron sand in different angles, from the left and right maintly.

As he did this, he'd remove a scroll from his belongings. He'd sent a surge of chakra through it, the scroll undid itself, revealing a fuuinjutsu seal in the midde. Smoke was produced as a giant cloth appeared in his grasp. Hopefully, the sand would've binded him as well as slowed his movements from the previous turn.

He'd channel chakra through the cloth, it swirled flowing forward to Kronos's sandy body as he soared through the skies with the aid of his platform of iron sand. End result, the cloth would probably bind him or block, shreaded whatveer may have happened.* - Mon Nov 16 06:54:43 2015

"D-Don't leave me again..." the teen left the fleeting Kronos with these words, as his body disolved into sand. His eyes were reddish in color from the tears, pain of the past that stung his eyes.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) "I'll... I'll start off with Gale palm then.." brought both of his hands up to the mid-section of his body, once there he'd clasp his hands. As he did this he'd concentrate, doing exactly as Hassan instructed, well following his tips he'd given him. Drawing in oxygen, he'd filled his lungs. With the air he'd inhaled, wind natured chakra mixed in, he'd channeled a little more chakra than usual as Hassan instructor.

"G'otcha.." he'd thought, his lips parted. Blowing outward, he'd released a powerful gale of wind towards Hassan, as the wind raced forward he'd expand his chakra outward. The cork from the teen's gourd poped off, forcing its way off. A little bit of the material was released, it formed into a single kunai. This kunai was manipulated forward, it flew into the compressed wind focused on Hassan, embuing itself with wind natured chakra, sharpening the blade.* - Mon Nov 16 09:51:21 2015

He'd release a sigh, "I was coming at you, That was supposed to be diversion. I failed, it seemed. Heh.." he'd felt a little bit sad, but he was caught for now.* - Mon Nov 16 09:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Ooooh there Lord Hassan with another kicker... He is so amazing  <3 - Mon Nov 16 10:03:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) wrist was grabbed, he couldn't move.."Shit.." raced through the teen's mind the moment Hassan's hand rose, the moment his finger attempted to flick his forward.. Iron sand raced forward at blinding speeds, over the flicked finger hopefully protecting the teen.

With his free hand, he'd manipulate the kunai from before. Its struggle with the wall behind where it collided. Once out, it'd attempt to come behind.. Though he'd most likely stop it, two tiles behind of Hassan.. He didn't want to hurt the man, or surpise him with this tactic, especially if he wasn't aware.* - Mon Nov 16 10:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) shut his eyes tight the moment dust was sent about, as the dust died down. Hassan was at Akira's side, that sucked.. Either way, he'd turn around and attempt to leave.* - Mon Nov 16 10:17:48 2015
