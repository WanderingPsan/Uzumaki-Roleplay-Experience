"It's a shame. I wonder awaits those that do not sin those that are pure..I heard storys but we all know worlds just a big lie right."She mumbles before using kunai to carefuly cut into girl ass. Being ever so careful hanae was only trying to cut off a thin slice of skin and bit of flesh nothing that would be lethal in her mind.

CArefully shuffling through it all before walking back over to girl she held what seemed to be a one bones in formarm in her hand. She stares at girl with a evil smirk on her face. "Ever had a bone inside you?"she asked kind of playfuly it was a funny joke. Hanae laughs and walks over so she had girls ass in her sights again. She places kunai in her mouth by holding th ehilt of it with her teeth as her hand then grabs onto girls cheek. Slowly and carefuly hanae starts press bone against girls cheeks moving it closer to that hole.

"This should be exciting."she mumbles* - Mon Nov 30 06:12:03 2015

Hanae keeps on wit her action untill at elast a good three inches of bone was inside the girls ass. it didnt have a sharp end so no prries other then stretching and any other pain is what girl might feel. Once it was in there hanae would walk over to other side slipping a figner between girls folds.

"Sadly I cant let you stay upside down."Hanae said before tossing her kunai aiming to cut rope keeoing hanae hanging up. Allowing girl to fall to ground though her feet and hands would still be binded of course.

"I suggest you get some rest. "Hanae mumbles.* - Mon Nov 30 06:59:50 2015

"I'm happy to see they doing okay."she mumbles.* - Mon Nov 30 10:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Would smirk a little before pushing on zenakis chest with force to get her to back up once or if that was done hanae presses her hands together forming a few seals. If zneaki happen see the seals it would be all over as a bit dust would seem float around zenaki with powreful gust of circling wind before stopping. "We going to take a trip"she mumbles.* - Mon Nov 30 10:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) would remove a kunai form her holst and points it at zenkai.

"We are going on a trip. Now you can do this easly and come along and not say a word or hard way, which ends up in me slottering your kids and then taking you by force your choice."hanae whispers* - Mon Nov 30 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Keeps lookignat Zenaki with emotionless face. Hanae skin had changed a slight color as well her eyes. Eyes are black, every thing baout hanae seems little changed something was indeed new.

"Then we are in agree ment. Pack up some stuff for you kids and then we are going to leave."she said.* - Mon Nov 30 11:14:59 2015

Soon after it wibbles around and Hanae smirks tossing it to the floor. The fish creator then grows and shape shifts into a perfect copy of zenaki.

"Get packing zenaki. Wouldn't want them die in desert now would we."she said* - Mon Nov 30 11:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) snaps her fingers slightly and walks off heading north. 

"Been so long."Hanae mumbles looking around the village lots have changed but it didn't matter really.

<This new power I wonder what I can really do with it.>She thought.* - Tue Dec  1 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Many memories from this place...  - Tue Dec  1 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) arriving in the training area hanae glances around and sighs.

"Indeed."hanae said, memories over flowing her mind it was all her past something she cut ties to. 

"But some memories are just past events. Those events no longer matter."She said* - Tue Dec  1 19:39:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Okay. - Tue Dec  1 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Lets start wit your poison fog. - Tue Dec  1 19:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Lets go. - Tue Dec  1 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Would slide her hands form her cloak and clap her hands together then spreads her feet apart a little and bends her knees slightly. Starting to focus on her chakra as well keeping eye on zenaki. "I see build up of chakra for that jutsu is rather large."She mumbles before gritting her teething letting out a slight sigh. It was hard to tell but hanae was on going a transformation. As the poison fog began to spread slowly through the area hanae would stick her hands out openign them. Her palsm facing out as if targeting the fog.

Zenaki may see a pare of lips in midle of hanaes palms. The lips open slightly but as nothing happens Hanae raises a brow. "Shit"she mumbles before placing her hands down and rushing off to the side placing a hand over her face to keep poison from getting inside her.
 
Once she was slightly clear she takes in some air and glances at her hands and would smirk. "Thought that would do sometihng."She mumbles before relaxing her self allowing the transformation to wear off. Which means lips went away, once that was done she looks at Zenaki.

"Hopefully I didn't get poison-"sentence was halted as she felt odd feeling in her body. "I guess I breathed in a slight bit of it."She mumbles scrtching her neck.* - Tue Dec  1 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) ||

"Don't worrie abuot it now just focus on your jutsu. "She said before darting off runing after zenaki. Of course she held her breath trying to fiigure out what jutsu to train so many she needs to master. So just for damn fun she presses her hands together forming a few seals. Once the seals were complete she takes time to focus on her own chakra supressing it so it could be faintly sensed. As if it mattered but she needed to water this jutsu and the rest she held in her mind.

<this poison is..Hope I dont end up hurt all that much.>she thought,really hoping she can hold out on inhaling it. Her goal once she got close to Zenaki was to send few jabs into girls stomach light onces that is.* - Tue Dec  1 20:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Kept her breath held she still had few more second before she needed air. Her eyes were kepts on zenaki figure she couldtn hide from hanaes sight unless wall stood in her path. Hanae quickly moves in a zig zag motion dodge a few of shuriken but get hit in her shoudler by one. It cuases her pain so it was hard not to smile from it. <You play dirty. need to focus on my own jutsu though>She thought clapping her hands together, focusing a tad as she ran to suppress her chakra a tad more. Then returns her focus on runing at zenaki. 

Able to close distance between each other rather quickly but Hanae wouldn't attack her no assuming zenaki was still on the move. <This fog is rather annoying>She thought.* - Tue Dec  1 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Would halt her approach to Zenaki allowing chakra to pour into her feet then quickly pushing off the ground releasing the chakra aiding her in jumping high into sky. Hopefully where poison had not reached yet. Once there she inhales depely through her nose and stares down at the poison fog cloud.

"Ease up, not really trying to fight just trying keep u under some presure. You need get good in combat."hanae said, at same time she rolls her eyes pressing her hands togehter forming a few seals. Then again focuses on suppressing her chakra a tad bit. See when she used suimen to help her jump it roke her focus she had to restart it all over again.* - Tue Dec  1 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Once she had got some breath back she holds it and gravity forces her body down to ground. Hanae sees fog coming and holds her hands up as she enters it alnding on the ground she grits her teeth slightly and starts to rush off aiminng to run where znekai was because it most safe area form poison she assumes. At the same time she focus on supressing her chakra keeping her hands together so she can slowly force her chakra to give off a little signature.* - Tue Dec  1 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) would turn around qucikly and try to see fi she could find zenkai but it was hard..She kept focusing on supressing her chakra keeping her hands pressed together but then shelf her legs go num causing her to all to her knees. Her arms then went num and then haane falls down her face hitting ground and her hands nex tot her said. She still holds her breath but is wondeirng how poison got her. 

<Damn it, zenakis jutsu is rather annoying.>she thinks before keeping her breath held knowing soon she was going open her mouthing to breath..But she is going to fight it, so she trys to force her sel fup. Able to stand to her feet against bust stumbles over ot fence. Her face turning blue..<damn I need get away form the fog.>she thinks.* - Tue Dec  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) would inhale through her nose then falls back laying on her back coughing. the poison taking effect causing her body ot go num, she couldnt move this was strangly bad for hanae.

"fuck"she muumbles* - Tue Dec  1 21:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Miscellaneous... Different things that is important about me..That is to be noted down. Do you know something? - Fri Dec  4 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Closes her eyes slightly inhaling then exhaling. Hanae listens to Rias speak about the jutsu, carefully she listens to every detail. At th esame time hanae woul have took a seat on the ground crossing her legs. Her hands press together and she starts to focus on her chakra slightly. Allowing her mind to be given th eneeded boost it needs to use such a techinque.. 

"Last time I did this I strained my mind..Hopefully I wont push my self to hard."Hanae thought before having all information transfered over from Rias into her own mind. Hanae smirks a little licking her lips the very thought of having knowledge poured into her own mind like this was rather interesting. An inner spark inside her very soul of thousands of ideas and jutsu to creat in near futur.. 

But soon those thoughts are pushed away and Hanae focus on task at hand. Her feelings and her htoughts are slowly gathered up a bridge of mental energy is slowly formed linking up with Riad slowly. During this time Hanae sighs slightly kind of feeling the slight stress of techinque already. But so far she was able to creat the link unlike her first few times in suna where she failed before i twas created..

Now she slowly starts to transfer her very thought along this bridge this being an even harder task. As the mintuse pass on those watching can see a slight trail of blood coming from her nose. But hana seems to be locked in focus. <Come on.>She thinks remaining focus the message half way there as another minute passes it reaches its needed target. A message for Ris from Hanae simeply was <Thank you.> Once Rais had got massage hane would slouch over ending her focus. 

She pants and huffs wiping the blood from her nose. Her hands then rest on her forhead and she sighs again. "what a pain"she mumbles* - Fri Dec  4 22:26:33 2015
