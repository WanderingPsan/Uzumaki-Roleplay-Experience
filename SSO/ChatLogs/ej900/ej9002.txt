Orders few cups of tea for the both of them then makes eye contact with Zenaki.

"It sucks that Kitora died durnig the last battle. "Beth said in a soft tone.* - Sat Sep 12 15:18:24 2015

her hands shift a little as she places them together locking her fingers between one another and such.

* - Sat Sep 12 15:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: You know. - Sat Sep 12 15:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: This is pretty big table. - Sat Sep 12 15:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
with that statement her hands formed one seal and her gaze on Zenaki tunrs a bit cold. Beth was going threw some reall hard core emotions deep in her soul. a slight aura of just evil surrounds her as she kept her gaze on Zenaki. Of crouse her chakra had been gathering up as she attempts once more to take control of Zenakis body. 

* - Sat Sep 12 15:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"and I'm back inside here. "Beth said to Zenaki form her mind. It was a thought of sorts and now that beth has mastered the jutsu she is able to contorl people even better.

Zenakis hands are placed on her stomach then slide up to her chest. "So whats with bandeges and all. Why not let these big boobies hang out. Show off  yo true body."Beth again told Zenaki* - Sat Sep 12 16:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"Normaly I do this for my own fun but cleaerl you hate it. It wouldnt be right of me to treat a best friend like this."She thought.. She then gave Zenkai control of her body but dind't leave her mind but how would she know... Beht just waits a little before she would act.
* - Sat Sep 12 16:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) again takes contorl of Zenaki and makes her move a hand down to her lap. She made zenakis hands slowly move to inner thigh area..

"But you like this don't you."She thought letting out a little laugh but Zenaki would be one laughing of course.* - Sat Sep 12 16:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"Your hand has five fingers two little fingers want to go play.."She made zenaki hand slide up a little her figner would slowly rub in that around. "But it seems the door is locked. So one little finger has to pick the lock~"She thinks again, She makes Zenaki tilt her head back a little.

* - Sat Sep 12 16:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"Seems they opened the door."She thinks talking to Zenaki threw her own mind. At the same time she makes zenaki unbutton her pants so her hand could happly slide inside of clothing. Once that was done the rubing would start up again. 

"I'm just so twisted arn't I."She thinks.* - Sat Sep 12 16:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"You know I never done sometihng like this to my self.. It's intresting to see the reaction you have." She thought now making Zenaki poke the area she was rubbing with her finger and then movng that finger in a counter clock ways. At the same time Beth trys nd forces Zenakis other hand into her shirt so she could force zenakis hand to rub her breasts..

"I wonder if th eemployees have noticed you yet."She thought.* - Sat Sep 12 16:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"Why stop now? Arn't you post to get sometihng from this type of thing."She thought before she made zenakis figners slie past her panties. She makes the girl open her legs a little bit before her fingers would go back to rubing that area. 

"Now just imagen the love of your life or a someone you like right. Thats how most women do it right that dream about it. "She thought.* - Sat Sep 12 16:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"Oh please you are.. You have to be your mind must be going crazy about this..  You must be feeling alot of emotions.. "She thought now the index finger would  slide inside of zenaki it repeats that motion slowly as her thumb rubs the hot spot a little.

Zenaki hand would be foreced to squeeze the breast it was rubing on.

"Warm a virgins warmth maybe?"She thought.* - Sat Sep 12 16:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"I already started might as well finish."She thought as she would make zenaki finger go faster and such. Beth had never done this to her self but reading books about sex when she was younger made her have a littel knowledge on this. 

Beth then would laugh a little as she wasn't going to rob zenaki of a real climax her in a tea shop so she forced Zenakis hand away form her area. She would move the hand that was grabbing her breast down to her side and would try to force Zenaki to place her index finger that did the evil dead into her mouth forcing her to suck her finger clean. If that was all done the jutsu over Zenaki would be released for real.

If not then sh ewould still release it to save chakra. Returngin to her own body Beth would sit up and stare at Zenaki. * - Sat Sep 12 17:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Now that sh ewas infront fo the amle she would bring her hands up and start to mvoe threw a few hand seals. She reall hopes this man watches closely because it was going to be wonderufl for him to see the last things he would ever see.

Of course Beth had her reasons for doing tthis chain fo seals and hopefully things would go her way. As she does them she breahts in and narrows her eyes on him. Apon the finishisng the last seal she would exhale her charka had bene moving threw her loungs a little and her head. Himura wouldf ele s if his body ws being swallowed up by a large amount of fire burning at his flesh, clothing and boiling his blood.

Those around Beth would not see any thing of the such at all she wishes to shut him up for reasons unknown Beth did things rather off the book some times. Then again every thing is done for a reason in this world and as long as she has a reaosn she careless for the others.

But during thise time a cold aura is surrounding Beth and her very soul is smiling at the actions of its flesh host.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Her behavior is strange. - Sun Sep 13 01:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) A smile is still held on her face that cold aura has grown stronger now that Himura was screaming or expressing how much pain he was in. She would fold her arms over he chest and watch him roll around. Her focus very much on him she watches his chakra signature closely as well the others around her.

"Intresting his suffering will last hopefully."She thought before reahcing for a water bottle and taking a sip from it. She now stnads regaining chakra as well collecting in on her thoughts. 

"Kitora died of course not at the hands of kirigakura but you all are enemies to me. Suna, kumo, kiri, and every one ells beside the group. Once I gather the information from this one his life is only to be ended rather by me or Zetsumo. "she thought Beth wasn't someone who didn't have a strong bond to her loyalty to Zetsumo. No nothing could break that but was she one to always lsiten to him no. The death of her best friend has sparked a little lust for blood and death that evil soul of hers is starting to really show more.

She yawns a little as if bored she would inhale then exhale allowing forher mind to come to a time of rest and peace for now. It was never good for her to let her thoughts cloud her mind.

"Well thats done."she said.* - Sun Sep 13 01:54:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Well seeing that the others were busy learning and having htere fun Beth would trail off south finding a place where she could be alone for just a tad bit. The river would be a nice place to train so she heads there standing near the bank of the river lookign down at the water. It was moving peaceful and kind of let Beths mind come to peace. She inhales then exahles before bringing her hands togehter forming one seal. With that seal she began to knead chakra form her core into her gut. Sense she has done thise before for the syrup trap jutsu she laerned before she knew she could get thise raging waves jutsu down. 

Carefuly her chakra is spiraling out of her core and moving threw the hundreds of charka points in her body. Storing up in her gut letting it build up slowly. Her gut kind of pokes out just a little bit as she is allowing for chakra to build up inside her. At this time she began to think over the information Zetsumo told her and how he explained how the jutsu was done. It wasn't sometihng she would have much trouble with at all but to make sure she wouldn't fail hard core she thinks over how to do the jutsu few times.

"Okay It should be tuff but I can do it.."She thought. Now her hands would form the other seals needed for the jutsu. As the seals were being completed the chakra in her gut would spin around quickly traveling up to her mouth. Her cheeks would poke out a little bit before she parts her lips a little letting the water come out. Though instead of this great raging stream fo water it was just a littel drizzel of water that fail to the floor. Beth sighs a little and kicks at teh ground with her righ tfoot just a tad. 

"That is kind of a downer."She thought as she wipes the water form her chin and lips. Again she inhales and then exhales calmly and would make the first seal for the jutsu with her hands. The chakra inside her body began to store up in her gut again. "Gather the chakra and then follow the other steps."She thought. Once she had gathered some chakra up she again does the rest of the hand seals needed for the jutsu would do the motion to shoot the water form her mouth. 

But instead of a raging water stream it was just water slowly pouring out of her mouth moving down teh sides of her lips and such. She would sigh a little after spitting the rest of the water form her mouth out and wiping her face. "I'm just getting all wet now."She htought to her self. How could someone who dislikes water be born with the chakra nature. It was a drag for Beth but she needed to at least of knowledge of few water style ninjutsu. "Well can't just give up."She thought.

Again she goes through the chain pf hand seals needed for the jutsu. She allows for the chakra gathered in her gut to rush up to her mouth as she changes that charka into water as well tries to control it so it can be shot out liek a raging wave. But as she parts her lips and allows for the water to be free form her mouth it just pours out as if she was a water fountain. Beth would shake her head and wipe her mouth before she took few steps back and sighed. "This is bother some."She thought to her self looking around the area.

Beth then decides to walk onto the water standing on the rivers surface thanks to suimen. Little ripple move about the waters surface as she takes her few steps. Her hands come together to move threw the hand seals needed for the jutsu Zetusmo showed her how to do. Once they were done she has a littel flash back to how he did it and would then nod. "I can do I can really do this."She thought.

Her hakra began to gther inside her gut once more, she kept her focus on this. Once she felt like she had gthered the right amount of chakra for this jutsu she would let the charka move form her gut to her mouth. The charka she gathered is turned to water and soon she parts her lips and allows for a strong stream of water to shoot form her mouth pouring into the river. She smiles but feels as if she could do better it was no were near the level of power Zetsumo did it and it would most likely never get to that point but she can try.

To make it a little better. So she again she does thehand seals and focuses on her chakra gathering it up. Her eyes narrow on the river as she would smile a little chakra moved from her gut to ehr mouth turning to water quickly. Using her knowledge of chakra control she contorls the water so it shoots out in a powerful beam or raging wave type thing. She sighs a little have finally completed the jutsu all tha tneeds to be done is master it. "Piece of cake."She thought.* - Mon Sep 14 18:32:57 2015

Could feel the heat of the massive fire ball. She looks up stares into the face of it as it comes down torwards her. Normally those in this genjutsu woul dbe freaking out but Beth seems to stand up against the jutsu. She has a smile on her face for the pain sh ewas feeling brought joy to her even though she knew it wasn't reall. Inside this genjutsu she began to focus on her sensory abilities. She is able tos ense her chakra signature was off the effect of being inside a genjutsu. As well she could still sense Shins chakra or well a chakra signature close to her.

"Well I can't say this is bad at all."She said her hands coming togther as she forms a seal. Her chakra was being gathered up large amount of it and soon she relases it breaking the genjutsu. The effect soon vade away and Beth pants one or twice as she shakes her head.

"I like it."She said. * - Mon Sep 14 19:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Meh. - Mon Sep 14 19:24:09 2015

With no wait at all she brought her hands up and began to mvoe through a short chain of ahnd seals. This being a trigger for a genjutsu of ourse If shin wished to make his mind stronger thin looking at her trigger wasa  good way to start things off. 

"Don't hold back on teh screams okay."She said. Once before the effect of the jutsu would take. The sky darkens and only thing that lights up Shins world is a massive fire ball that is coming down from the sky. Its nothing but a roaring fire ball that scorcthes the grass and tresss. It burns clothing and boils flesh. 

"Descending Fire jutsu"She mumbles to her self.* - Mon Sep 14 19:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) folds her arms ove rher chest and watches Shin. It seems he was trying to fight against the genjutsu which was good. Beth wanted to see if he could with stand it for long. She also sighs as she thinks back to when she was inside his genjutsu.

"If thats not a wake up call I don't know what is."She thought to her self.* - Mon Sep 14 19:51:28 2015
