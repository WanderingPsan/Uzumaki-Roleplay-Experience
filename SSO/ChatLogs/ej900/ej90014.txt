<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Oh well. - Mon Nov  9 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Moves her hands to her straps carefully removing the turtle shell letting it fall to the ground. She stretches her arms a little and back before she grabs a little handy dandy black cloak from one of her pouches. She had carefully rolled and folded to fit in there of course. She unfolds it then places it on. 

"I don't want to get to dirty."She said before staring over to Jiki. Her hands raised up about chest level. "Here goes nothing."She said fomring a few seals quickly. Once complete she would exhales softly.

Jiki would then see a clone slowly rise up out of the sand near Hanae. Two others rise form sand behind him all three stares at the man with smirks on there face. Hanae would quickly jump back a few feet then use suimen to aid her in jumping up onto the wall behind her.

She then folds her arms and watches from above.

"Remember if you can't defeat them in one hit you owe me hundred grand."She said.* - Mon Nov  9 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: (Is it Mist Servant? Cause I'll know the seals, if it is.) - Mon Nov  9 20:06:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Finally landed on the wall staring down at Jiki she smirks a tad. Her right hand rubing her chin a little as she watches him closely. <Kneading up good amount of  chakra there arn't you.>She thought as she could feel his chakra. She watches closely as he uses his first jutsu sharuikens it seems a deadly weapon. 

"Nice.."She mumbles her left reaching in her pouch grabing a kunai. Her eyes narrow down on the shuriken coming her way but it wasn't something she couldn't dodge really. She takes a few steps back to one throw off there aim a little.

<Wind style chakra as well. Cute I'm tempted to let one hit me just for pleasure.>She thought carefully reading her self if they would come to closer to her instead of stabbing into wal some where then she would use her kunai to smack the shurikens from the air. Aiming mainly to hit one on the left carefuly moving her body to left a tad as well so second one would just pass by her.

"Post to be aiming at the clones remember?"she asked shouting a tad for Jiki to hear.* - Mon Nov  9 20:31:47 2015
