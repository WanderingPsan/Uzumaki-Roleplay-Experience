"Oh Zenaki can I help you?"she ask kind of opening the door a little more.* - Sun Nov  8 22:15:28 2015

"Well you can come inside. I'll be in the back room."She said turning around walking back to where she had remy. She opens the door and shuts but the door stays open a little.

"Now I can do lots of things to you now remy but what I really want you do try and do is relax. You got to learn to relax if you can't relax then you'll shut down fast every time domething happens to you.. This is a well how can I say training for you."she said

"Tsk, they all ways say that.. But I know this one loves me more then any thing yet I'm still treating him like all the others.."She laughs a little bringing the kunai to er mouth licking it, licking the blood off of it.

"I guess love is just something I fool dreams for in this world..I guess I'm just to twisted... Honestly he never really gave the pain I wished for...But he really did care for me..I guess I'm just a heartless being."She said turning and walking for the door.

"Oh well it's not fun when they are not awake. I'll wait for him to wake up before doing anything ells."she said.* - Sun Nov  8 22:47:02 2015
