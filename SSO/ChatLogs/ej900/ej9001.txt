<br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) had just walked in.

"Uh, sure." Quickly, the dark-skinned mentalist moves on over, and channels chakra to her hand.* - Sun Aug 30 15:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) nods. Chakra continued to be built up, and eventually, it's pouring from her palms. The right hand, now gushing with spiritual power, is pressed against Kitora's forehead. The contact prompts the gathered energy to flow through the kunoichi's pores, and attack the chakra points directly. It glides, easily slipping into her stream of power seamlessly, and melding. Now that a part of Beth's will had been ingrained within Kitora's chakra circulatory system, the genjutsu specialist now held free reign to manipulate the girl.

Yin release is employed, and the portion of the brain that governed 'will' was targeted. Hopefully, with the clear advantage in mind-based attacks, Beth is easily able to break the girl down.

"Okay. . . Let's start with some questions. Are you happy with the current directions of things? And more importantly. . . do you remain loyal to Zetsumo and the organization as a whole?"* - Sun Aug 30 15:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) tilts her head. The most important part of the interrogation had been accomplished. 

"Hrm . . .Well--" She stops herself, as Zetsumo makes a clear inquiry. "What he said. . . What has you unhappy? If you have any issues, air your greviances, and offers alternatives," the genjutsu specialist demands. The flow of chakra grows more ferocious in hopes that nothing is held back.* - Sun Aug 30 15:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) never let Kitora out of the genjutsu. Well. . . At least not until Zetsumo had given the orders.

Now that Kilm was in place, Beth is again releasing chakra  and manipulating it into the Yin Release nature transformation. There's a light blue glow developing, and once more, her mitts find it's way tethered to the male's flesh. Chakra pumps, slipping through the 'cracks' in boy's flesh, and assaulting his chakra circulatory system directly. Assuming he lacked the cognitive ability to resist, Kilm's will is completely and utterly destroyed, making it so that the truth would be the only words that could slip from the boy's mouth.

"Right. . . Let's begin,. Firs--" She stops short, as Zetsumo seemed to take charge on this occasion. * - Sun Aug 30 16:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) claps her hands together to charge up more power. Once more, the interrogation jutsu is in full effect. She huffs, and proceeds to ask question on her own accord.

"I'll start with a string of questions. If any answers displease me, I'll get more specific. Starting off. . . Your loyalty still lies within the Kenryoku, yes? And you haven't shared any information with outside parties. . . Correct?" She waits, pausing for a while, and mentally face-palms. That would have been a great question to ask the other two.

"Likewise, have you been in contact with anyone not positively affiliated with Lord Zetsumo?"* - Sun Aug 30 16:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Was unluckly walking threw village when all this shit began to happen. she had let out a sigh and for some reason found er self runing torwards the training area. She figured loud sound of explosions and rocks comign from that area ment some sort of battle. and she was intrested in that. Soon as she enters the training around she holst her movements.

"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten..And more..What teh fuck."She said to ehr self she could sense the strang black beings in the area as well her comrades..

"There weapons are coated in chakra as well.."She thought to her to self well with nothing much to do so far she just stays on her guard and readies her self for battle. First things first her hands move threw a quick chain of hand seals, her chakra was being molded into her gut..

"Let's see what I can do.."She thought. * - Sun Aug 30 22:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
She watches the creaters get blown away but they seem to pretty strong beings. As they began to get into there formations Beth would inhale then quickly release a rather large amount fo syrup style water out torwards the group of beings. Luckyl she had done hand selas for this jutsu before hand. 

"Those green spheres.."She thought as she could clearely see them as well sense them. She had made a quick sprint to her left keeping her focus on creaters as well the green slime spheres. 

"I"m sure there jutsu hold alot of pwoer behind them"She thinks as her right and left ahnd reach into her back pouches. She grabs few kunai about three for eac hand that exploding tags tied to them. She then quickly throws kunai at the balls of slime. Each tag would sizzle as she had set a timer. For few seconds so each kunai could meet with slime balls then explode hopefully this would cause them to break apart into really smaller bits of slime. 

Hopefully only things the slime would touch would be ground and maybe some on her clothes. Because yea that stuff sounds nasty..* - Sun Aug 30 23:01:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Would bring her hands together going through a chain of few hand seals quickly. Her chakra was now being sent form her body into Sabos as the genjutsu was taking root inside the boy. 

"Sabo, where does your loyalty stand? Is it with Zetsumo or with someone ells? If so who and what would there name or names be."She asked. One question to start off things.
* - Mon Aug 31 01:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Takes in a slow breath then would exhale quickly. She cocks her head to the left a little and narrows her eyes onto Sabo. She would smile just a tad because she could see that he was aggrovated a bit. Though she wonders if he telling the truth, who knew how strong his will was. 

"If you where ever captured by those outside of the Kenryoku  would you feed them information?"She askes.* - Mon Aug 31 01:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) releases Sabo of the jutsu* - Mon Aug 31 01:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) lazily walks over to Dissida she stnads infront of the female with a smile on her face. Of course Beths hands were moving through the set of hand seals for the jutsu she was about to cast onto Dissida. Once the seals were done Beth had sent her chakra into Dissidas body and would allow for the jutsu to tke root. It spreads threw her mind searching deep into her memories using thos memories to help get the questions to come answered. Seeing as this jutsu didn't take much time at all to kick in Beth would move intot he spot light. She clears her throat and would part her lips as she askes the first question.

"Where does your loyalty stand, If it is not with Zetsumo then who and what are there names?"She would question Dissida narrowing her eyes so she made perfect eye contact with Dissida.* - Mon Aug 31 01:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Witht he words from Paine Beth would form one hand seal and would increase the power of the genjutsu a little. Trying to have it dig a farther into her mind, she wanted Paine to answer these questions perfectly but that wasn't going so well now was it. Beth stands there trying to think of the next question to ask Paine.

* - Mon Aug 31 02:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) places her hands to her side and kind of glacnes at Zetsumo after he had well hit Paine in a burst of anger. Beth then sighs once more before taking few steps clsoer to Paine as she would continue with the questioning.

"Do ou know where Kronos is located or might be?" She askes, then would celar her throat a little.

"Can you list the techniques Kronos uses?"She askes then would just stand there thinking of some more..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Had walked into the area her hands folded over her chest her eyes staring at Sabo and Zetsumos spar. She couldn't help but sigh softly as she takes some intrest in watching the fight. 

"Well he must be pretty god wtih a Katana."She thought.* - Tue Sep 01 23:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) huffs. It was reaching that point. Beth, while ignorant of the ongoings of the world could feel it. It was as if she held a sixth sense, one that went far beyond chakra sensing. . . A sense that made her able to detect or feel out omens. Calmly, her eyes glance around the beautiful nature of the natural forest. The wind sang in just the right way, and the tree branches danced along to the tune. . . But it was clear.

"This isn't going to last long. . . The era of peace. It comes to a close here." THere's a wicked grin being worn.Her hands clutches, and presses against her heart, and her gaze turns to four o'clock. "Zetsumo-sama. . . Is it at last time to begin the hunt?" Her heart fluttered a bit, and anticipation for potential battle was at an-all time high.

Buuut. . .Beth knew she still needed quite a bit of work. Thus, she's back on her grind, and ready to work on mastering a slew of difficult techniques. Genjutsu. .. The art of illusion. In all honestly, it was especially difficult, as using even the most basic genjutsu required an exceptionally high degree of chakra control. What more, if not perfected, any Tom, Dick, or Harry could see through, and render the whole purpose of the application inert. Finally. . . Beth often lacked a competent or consistent training partner. Thus, knowing discrepancy in an illusion was often difficult.

On this occasion, the focus was going to be geared towards the supplementary, and often  situational technique -- Sly Mind Effect.  It was a peculiar ninjutsu, one that didn't target a traditional sense. . . but the sense of direction. Odd, and mystifying.

"Alright. . .Let me go back to what I remember. To do this technique, I have to effect the sense of direction. Which really isn't a traditional sense, but a combination of several. Which ones were they again?" The poor, dark-skinned sadist seemed to have trouble remembering. Her hand moved through er hair in thought.

"Sight? For sure. Hearing? Not so much. . . So sight is one. I'm guessing it's also the sense of feel. Since you have to feel as if you're going in the right direction. SO cool, that's how you do it. Just  gotta effect sight and feel at the same time, while tricking the opponent to go in circles." She smiles, figuring that the explanation was indeed al ogical one. Quickly, her body breaks off, and she's sprinting off into the forest, looking for some pitiful soul.

After fourty minutes of searching, she finds her target. And boy. . . It's such a lucky victim to find strolling around. A simple gent, moving with a caravan filled with apparent businessmen. The vehicle moves swiftly, and seems to have no trouble manuevering about the often rigid terrain of the forest. "Okay. . Only three seals. And the technique works uniquely in that the trigger isn;t from sight, smell, taste or hearing. But by 'feeling."

Indeed, for the jutsu to work, the victim would just have to step into the genjutsu's radius. Once their bodies came in contact, it was all easy pickings. Thus, the athletic figure speeds along the treetops, and builds up chakra. As a novice with the skill, her range isl imited. At the most, she can manage a good one-hundred meters, before her skill begins to grow unstable and generally is useless.

Inthe hundred meters being leapt, Beth effortlessly maps out how the genjutsu is to be placed. In time, the group approaching will have no choice but to continue going around in circles. In the event that they shift directions, the bulk of trees will ensure that a proper range of motion is never discovered. Thus, it will keep them in an endless loop, great for wearing out stamina.


"Alright, boys! Let's keep it moving! Kumogakure is right around the corner! Ahoy!" They seemed so happy an eager to move ahead. The destination it was so close. . .Forshame. They had trespassed onto Amegakure property.

The second a meter had been passed, the genutsu was in effect. Beth yawned, sitting among the tree and just observing as the caravan of individuals moved in endless circles. It was like watching prime-time television. They had no chance of knowing, as none possessed any ninjutsu or genjutsu ability. ". . .Oi. Don'tcha guys think this is taking a little longer than usual?"

Of course, it -had-. By now, two hours had gone by, with Beth constantly applying more chakra to the basic genjutsu, and giggling like a damn Loli. Eventually, she speeds, revealing herself to each of the individuals with a wide-grin. "Hiiiiiii~!!! IMan, you guys really haven't noticed? I placed you all in a genjutsu! It's a trick! One big trick! Aren't I smart~?!" She says in a fcutesy tone, more or less taunting.

Mind you, Beth is a petite, teenager. Meanwhile, a large chunk of the men are thick, burly and muscular. Each easily looking as if they're able to snap her ass in half without a moment's notice. And they're going to do it!

"Charge!'

Cue three seals later. Their bodies seemingly are engulfed with flames that come from the skies. Of the fireballs are large, and apparently the size of meteors. They crash harshly, and eventually the men fall unconcious due to mental assault.* - Wed Sep 02 07:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
With those trio dealt with, Beth feels that her work for the moment is done. Her body flickered within a plum of smoke and before long, the genjutsu specialist was all gone. She'd continue with the movement, up until Konoha hadb een reached once more.

In no time, she's sitting at the local park, replenishing much needed chakra that had been expended in the last outing. It takes an hour at the most before the afro-cladded shinobi up and about. The Sly Mind Effect technique was all fine and dandy, yet it still remained an irritating jutsu to master or even utilize. Indeed, she opts to go back to focusing more on an 'offensive' genjutsu. An illusion that could thoroughly mindfuck those with weakened cognitive ability.

THe 'Descending Fire' technique. Due to her growing skill in allthings illusion, Beth now possessed the ability to stray the technique a bit from the original path. In the original version, the user unleashes a simple sphere of fire from the skies. While simple, it was fiercesome, and often was used as a means to force your opponent into fleeing. Her hands go through a set of seals after getting a test subject-- who hadn't yet been alerted of the genjutsu's origin. "Okay. . .Okay. Sit still."

Her hands goes through a string of handsigns, allowing chakra to flow into the skies and attack the cerebral systems. THe chakra that vibrated eventually settles and allows for the illusion to be set into play. Due to her hight intelligence, Beth is more than able to properly manipulate and simulate the true properties of fire.

From the clouds, giant spheres of inferno-based destruction are descending. --

"W-What?! What's going on? Do you not see this?!" Beth continued to pretend as she's working on a jutsu, performed handsigns, but no longer kneading chakra. "Huh? Yeah, the sun is really hot today. Now quit whining--" The male cuts her off again, screaming and aiming to run. 

Each time  his mind transmitted a signal to actually go and escape, his body refused to react. He was like a deer in the headlights.As a result of Beth's attention to detail, not only do the giant spheres release a mass of illumination, but they gave the appearane of heat. Literal heatwaves usher through the skies, and distort the space-- making everything appear hazy.

Likewise, in it's continued approach, eventually the heat is saturating the area. It not only burns against the person's body, but naturally, he's sweating. Whether or not the sweat is an illusion, or a fake reaction towards the boy's preception of heat remained to be seen. 

Nevertheless, and it's approach, Beth is seemingly engulfed as well. The fire clings to the poor soul's flesh, and begins to burn the daylights out of him. ALthough, again. . . This was a simple illusion. It would go on for minutes at a time, roasting and burning the man alive, yet not quite reduced to ash just yet. It was a flaw she had yet worked out. Eventually, would the opponent not ponder whhy they weren't  reduced to dust?

Eventually, the person is rendered unconscious, much to Beth's delight. She takes a seat, giggling at the success and marks the technique as 'mastered.' * - Wed Sep 02 08:15:08 2015

"Allow me to restore some of that chakra you used."He statse as her hands move through a chain of hand seals.

"Seems good."she thought before making hakw flap its wings to pick up some speed and fly acrrost the skies quickly again still heading east to check out the rest of the area.

"So how long have you had that head band? Seems real bear up and dirty."She said just trying to start up some friendly chit chat.* - Sat Sep 05 15:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Would jump off the fence but onto other side of it. She then calmly made her way north moving past the trees and such.* - Sat Sep 05 16:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
STands ther elistening in on the sounds of battle happening to th e west of her location. From the reports coming in it was kumogakure shinobi attacking. What a intresting twist to all things hse knew she should have went on her misison to dig up information on kumogakure but she was stopped. Beth couldn't help but to look at Zetusmo and think back to those words he told her..

"Next time I'll just go."She thought to her self. Se began to focus her sensory skills on the area around her incase the enemy found a way into village to attack. Once hearing her orders Beth nods and would take a seat ont he ground before fomring a signal hand seal. 

She then sends her self into a hawk or bird that on one of the naer by fences or maybe the guards protecting her would havesupplied a bird for her to use or maybe had a bird near by. Once it was done she would take to the skys in her new body flying up into the air searching the sky. Most likely starting with area around the vilalge and down south.* - Sat Sep 05 18:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) || 
Scouts a little farther out downsouth searching for the enemies army as well any small group of people from the skys. Using the body of the bird she took over as her own it was a good skill to have and very intresitng and useful one at that. She can feel the tax from this jutsu on her chakra but it wasn't as bad as it use to be she can go on for longer amoutns fo time now. She also keeps a close eye out for others bird or things that might try to attack her incase mother nature wanted to be a big bitch.* - Sat Sep 05 18:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) After a long time traveling threw the skies searching over the area sh ewould release the jutsu she had on the bird snapping back into er own body with whatever amount of information she had gathered form this scouting mission she was given. She would stand up and head off west to where she knew zetsumo was. * - Sat Sep 05 18:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) HAd traveled threw the village quickly heading west she moves threw the trees and hle dher breath most of thetime incase she was in danger of the poison. Once she got to where Zetusmo was at she stops and stnds near a tree and would wave to him.

"I have the gather the information I could. Most of there attack force is coming the west near kumogakure but the soldiers are dressed in sunagakure clothing. So they are form snuagakure and not kumogakure."She stated in a clear voice.* - Sat Sep 05 18:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||

"I'm going to ake to the skies once more"She said before forming one hand seal again she looks around aiming to look for a bird or soemtihng to use. Once she had found that she wuold use her mind body rtansfer jutsu on it and take to the skies in her new bird body. Her own body was of course left behind untill she reutrns hopefuly she was guarded during this time. 

Inside the birds body Beth flys out west scannign the area tha tthe suna sinobi are trying to take to retreat as well looking tos e eif ther eany more calls of the army waiting to do more attacks. Or if they had set up a near by base incase they wanted to do attacks at a another time of day.* - Sat Sep 05 19:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) had released the jutsu on her bird returning to her body in few mintuse. She wakes and would head off to the villages gates seeing that she was moved to a safer place.* - Sat Sep 05 19:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would take few steps back sitting on the ground elaning agains the fence. She stares at Osamu.

"I wonder If I can have some fun with him."She thought.* - Sat Sep 05 22:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) walks over to Kitora and stands by her side.* - Sat Sep 05 22:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Would calmly walk off to the north heading to training grounds maybe?

"Forget that I need rest." She thought as she quicklys heads for a home to sleep in or maybe a tree.* - Sat Sep 05 22:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would have returned to the area.* - Sat Sep 05 22:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Nods to Zetsumo she quickly forms her hand seal and stares at the duck. "Now lets get this done"She said in jsut few seconds beths body had fallen to its knees nad slouches over and duck that she had took over went flying intot eh sky. The duck flys high and then dashes off tot he west Beth was now on the job workign hard to scan over the area searching kumos army seeing what wepaons they have brought along and how amny numbers are there. 

"Its all over for you."She thought to her self as he looks down at the army knowing things were about to go south for them hopefully she wasn't being to cocky here. * - Sun Sep 06 13:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
The juts on the duck was undon once beht had gathered some information on army coming there way. She returns to her body and looks at Zetusmo with a smirk on her face. Shes tands up folding her arms over her chest and would clear her throat.

"Kumogakure is taking a round-about route. It seems the army is going around the village."She said.* - Sun Sep 06 14:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) once she spotted the duck she was looking for which most likely wouldn't be much a of a problem seeing they always cmae back to zEtsumo or were trainined to. She would fomr her one seal and look to the duck. Soon her body again falls to its knees and slouches over as if she was sleep after that the duck wouldt ake flight once more. Beth takes tot eh skies inside her new duck body and would fly off to keep tabs on the army for a few hours or how ever long sh ecould stay isnide the ducks body with out wasitng any chakra past half.  Once she reached her cut off limit sh ewould fly back or just release the jutsu she had on duck and retunr her own body to report the information back to Zatsumo.* - Sun Sep 06 14:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Walks out.* - Sun Sep 06 15:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Looks at kitora and Zenaki.

"Where are you two off to?"She askes.* - Sun Sep 06 16:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) quickly turns around on her heals. She then taks a step forward opening the door to mansion and heading outside. 

* - Sun Sep 06 16:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Takes a seat at the table and places her hands in her lap. 

"Of course there isn't."She said before shooting one fo employees in the back a glance. 

"Tea please."She said.* - Sun Sep 06 16:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) with her hands placed in her lap she forms a hand seal and just sits there waiting for her tea. She glances at Zenaki a few times debating if she would have some fun with the girl. It has been a long time sense beth had just been her normal self and not so tense and edgy. 

"Alter-ego cool. So if you were to meet someone who gets first dibs? "She asked looking at Kilm.* - Sun Sep 06 16:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) || Chakra in Beths core had gathered up now and seeing that Zenaki was still just being miss grumpy pant Beth had made up her mind. She clears her throat a little and would stare at Zenaki then she would her jutsu to take effect. It should be a easy hook for Zenaki was just sitting there with her head down made things easer. 

"Let's see if I can make every one laugh."She thought of coruse Beths hea just kind of sloucehs over and rests on teh table once the jutsu was casted.* - Sun Sep 06 16:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Doesn't allow Zenaki any control over her body at all. INstead Beth makes her body sit up straight and smile. As the same time she makes Zenaki's ahnds move to her lap just leaving them there for now. 

"So whats been buging you Zena"Beth said talkign to zenaki through her mind and such.* - Sun Sep 06 16:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Makes Zenaki climb onto the table and stand up. She move her hands to grip on base of her shirt and slight pull it up.

"Fine don't want to tell me I'll just give th employees here a good show.. Well it'll be you seeing its your body and all."She says through her zenakis mind.* - Sun Sep 06 17:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||

"It's fine if you tell him. But come on you seem rather down today"She thought inside of zenakis mind. 

Now making Zenaki pull her shirt up some showing off what ever was under it rather it be another shirt or her skin. * - Sun Sep 06 17:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) || 
Just like that arms move to fully remove teh shirt and toss it over to the floor. Beth then looks at Zenakis bandages well makes Zenaki look at them but you get the point. She began to move her fingers on the bangages a little wondering what they were hiding.

"Alot of bandages here.. Whats under them?"She said to zenaki through her mind.* - Sun Sep 06 17:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"Order me?" She question with a thought. Now Beth had to make things happen but she could feel Zenaki fighitng back which was intresting. Beth never really had to deal with this but in all she was going to do what she wanted to. "Well let's not leave the employees hanging."She thought as she moves Zenakis hands to up to rip the bandages near her chest maybe exposing her breasts.* - Sun Sep 06 17:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"Then why did you seem so down today?"She thout still trying to rip the bandages or pull them downt o expose the chest. At the same time Beth began to make Zenaki shake her hips a little. 

Beth s forces Zenaki lips to part and her tounge to move to create words. "Don't be afriad to toss some yen boys~"* - Sun Sep 06 17:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"Fine." She said to Zenaki through her mind before releasing the jutsu that she had on the female. Beth sits up and looks at Zenaki who was standing on the table.

"I havne't had that much fun in a long time."She said as she moves to lean back against teh wall next to her.

* - Sun Sep 06 17:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) looks at Zenaki and would shake her head a little.

"I don't think a person needs love."She said.* - Sun Sep 06 18:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Would look at zenaki or stare at her almost as if her eye balls were trying to stretch out closer to the girl.

"What are you thinking..."Beth mumbles..* - Sun Sep 06 18:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would relax her self and leen back in her seat leaning on the wall.

"Say Zenaki have you ever had someone love you?"She asked.* - Sun Sep 06 18:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) reaches into her pocket pulling out a little white note book. She opens it and began to stare at what on the first page.

"I'll leave you alone though..."She said.* - Sun Sep 06 18:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) glances at Zenaki hten back to her book.

"Its nothing really."She said.* - Sun Sep 06 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Hair was kind of moving do to the speed of bird they werew riding on and the wind moving about. She has a smile on her face as well her hands are put close together incase she needs to weave an hand seals. She also keeps focus on using her sensing ability to scan for any signs of chakra in her rang. She also scans the area around her and maybe if she could take a glance down looking useing her above average sight to spot out any thing coming there way.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Osamu(Assassin241) whispers: (I hear a wild Katsune whispering) - Sun Sep 06 21:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"I can't give you those abilitys there has to be contact made between you and me at all times. Any way I'll just try to keep tabs out doe anytihng. Hopefuly your summoning can handle its self."She said.

Ofcourse beth had kept her focus on her sensory abillityes focusing alot more then what she normaly does. She was also ready to weave hand seals at a moments notice looking and watching her own back and such. She wasn't going to die today.

"I don't fear death at all. But I'm a ready to grant it."She mummbles.* - Sun Sep 06 21:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: (Well my traps did not get set off:c) - Sun Sep 06 21:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Her sensory abilitys are up and she is focusing on them more then she normaly does. She also had spotted the flying Amai with just eye sight alone and her sensing ability. She smiles a little and parts her lips a tad to talk to Zetusmo. 

"Just call my name when you need something."She states. Beth was standing ont eh same large ass duck Zetsumo was making sure to keep a furm grip ont he bird with suimen if need be. * - Sun Sep 06 22:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
kepts her focus on her sneory abilities happly telling Zetusmo teh location of teh girl that was free falling so he could have done his catch and choke out to her or whatever he had planned. She as well felt the massive amoutns foc harka from every oen on the field mades things a little hard for her to trac those in her rang but good thing she was focusing. She would raise a brow as she owuld notice that those small flcikers of chakr aor well teh several other signatures of the same chakra had gone away.

"Intresting so whatever this is must be sued to confuse sensory types like me. Why ells would a skill like this be used? I don't feel any chakra coming torwards us."She thought before noding to Zetsumo.

She focued a little harder on her sensory ability and maybe was able to pick up on those hiding inside the ground as well those rushing to get out of the rang of zetusmos explosion. 

With that she does few seals then places a hand on zetsumo allowing him to see or feel what she is sensing. 

"I'll give you charka son but take a look at what I can feel."She said to her elader.* - Sun Sep 06 23:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Eyes widne as hs ecould sense all teh massive amounts of chakra on the battel field or well those in her rang. She would sighs softly as sh eoulwd part her lips to warn Zetsumo so he knows.

"Chakra based attackes coming our way, hard to say the laction other then below us must be the ground troops along a massive amount fo chakra coing our way to. Its moving fast really fast."She states warnign him of the atack from the golem and th attacks form the troops of kumo and suna. If they were chakra based Beth damn well knew about them. Zetsumo would as well seeing she was transfering her sensing over to him at the moment during most of this clostery fucking.

She would remove her hand from Zetusmo which ends the sensing transfer to him. She now completely focuses on sensing for chakr abased attacks and such coming there way. 

"I'm getting damn good at this."She thought.
* - Sun Sep 06 23:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Raised a brwo as she could sense the massive amount of chakra coming from the troops as well Chiyari jutsut hat was made to incase them Beth had opens her mouth to warn Zetsumo...

"Massive amoutn fo charka below us form all sides and well chkra moving fast seems to be moving torwards us fast as well.. I'm sure your summon is handling this all but just be careful."She shouted for Zetusmo to hear..Her warnings kept on coming as the battle waged on and such. 

"This birds chakra is getting low."She thought.* - Mon Sep 07 00:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Would let out a soft sigh as hse flet her feet toucht he ground. They were no longer on teh alrge duck this made her sad becuase she was enjoying the fast safe life but hey now she can enjyo her self a litlte more.

"Zetsumo there is a odd amounts of chakra to my right as well still in this rea a little. But to my right and and south I can sense it I can't tell what it is but its annoying makes things hard for meto home in on who or whatever it is.. I felt the same chakra when we first came to the field but ti went away when your fire blasted teh area."She said to her leader as well keep her guard up and a close ey eon things* - Mon Sep 07 00:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Likely hostile. SHall we displace our location? - Mon Sep 07 00:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) whispers: Just keep a clsoe eye out. I'll try to figure out whats this chakra im sensing is all about..Wont take me long at all. - Mon Sep 07 00:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Again her hands moved through just few hands seals before her and Zetusmo went into battle now it seems they are going to aid in this fight some more. She placed her hand on Zetsumo body giving him the ability to sense what she coudl sense this should aid him during his moment to aid those who fight for him. 

"Chakra signature in those trees near Kitora and them.That strang chakr ais still over to the right unsure whats coming from there. "She said to zetusmo just giving few warnings and such.* - Mon Sep 07 00:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
notes teh fact she is still there using her sensing ability to keep tabs on things warning zetusmo as well using sensing transfer to allow ihm to sense what she can. 

((not really going to rp all tha tmuch. yall giving me a head ache))* - Mon Sep 07 02:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) yawns. She takes a seat, and looks around the relatively small village. As usual, she faintly picks up on chakra signals, almost out of reflex. While it wasn't quite was focused as it could be, this is what allowed Beth an almost constant awareness of the world.

Subsequently. . . her gaze falls onto Suitengu.* - Mon Sep 07 23:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) glanced to Suintengu. By now, she lazily keened in, focusing on his eyes. . . and gaining a strange vibe. It was subtle, however. Taking a quick comparison, she looks back and forth, eying Zetsumo, then Suitengu againa nd again. After a few minutes, the woman finally speaks up.

". . Does your eye hurt?" That was a logical question, right? Maybe something was just bugging this kid.* - Mon Sep 07 23:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) goes to rest her eyes.* - Tue Sep 08 00:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) walks off to go train.* - Tue Sep 08 01:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
After a good deal of time, Beth went back to practicing her own skill. The jutsu in question happened to be the oft overlooked, 'Chakra Transfer' technique. It was a skill that greatly assisted in her own ability to support, and certainly was an asset to the jutsu slinging abomination known as Zetsumo.

Quickly, she would call for an assistant. One of Amegakure's shinobi, that had recently suffered an excessive drain of chakra. He's winded, and is breathing heavily.

Swiftly, Beth orders the male forward, andh is sweatied body falls before her. Going over the thought, she re-iterated just what chakra transfer entailed. And honestly, it was a simple jutsu, in comparison to whatever else the world had to offer. After all, when you ran along with a guy that could nuke entire houses in single strikes, you tended to realize just how significant chakra could come to be.

Overall, chakra transfer was just seeping your own prowess into someone's body. However, it went further, as you would have to shift your chakra signature, and make it usable for each unique entity it entered. Clearly, this required impeccable chakra control, but what more, usually the technique henged on being familiarized with the chakra source.  As a sensor, this was no real issue, and the technique WAS possible wiithout having the ability to sense. Just more difficult.

Regardless, this made the woman a grand candidate for such. Without question, chakra is pumping, and being guided down her belly, or rather, up it as it tranverses the chakra pathway. Eventually, an azue-color foams out of her arms, speeding away from the chakra nodes along her body. It takes a gaseous state, before eventually latching onto the test dummy's frame. His body soon takes on the same coloration, although it's from every inch of flesh. Already, the Amegakure shinobi's breathing rate is calming.

Slowly, the chakra that once was Beth's own is flowing through the foreign pathway, and infusing itself with each of the nodes along the way. Eventually, each particle of energy finds it's way within the shinobi's belly. This being, the largest source of chakra in a human's body -- while the heart itself was the originator of said energy. It would coil, and tumble around even, before she'd proceed with the eventually manipulate of the chakra's signature. 

With a grunt, Beth is able to subsequently make her chakra pulse correspondant with the Amegakure shinobi. It comes to a rest finally, and a large chunk of her own reservoirs are drained. Beth now is sweaty, and breathing in a tired manner. She falls to a knee, and beckons the shinobi to leave her. 

Already, with that motion, the skill in the chakra transfer technique was growing more potent. In the beginnings, the teen found herself expending too much energy that really never made it's way to the desired target. Rather, a large bulk of the stamina found itself being dissipated into the wind, while a good ten percent had actually found a home in a new, foreign body. Today. . . was completely different, though. 

Now? Approximately seventy-percent had been used properly. Delighted, she allows herself to amusingly she looked ahead as her power replenishes itself. "Oi. I think i'm finally getting the hang of this. Let's roll. Just a bit more, and I should be able to not waste a single drop of my energy. Then I can probably try to teach other people the art. . . If they prove worth."

That said, she goes over the train of thought, and visualizes how to better reproduce the act.Beth's hand remained laid out in the air, and in the proper motion to truthfully provide additional energy. Along with these thoughts, she often contemplated working on her own chakra reservoirs. Perhaps then she could be a human battery.

* - Tue Sep 08 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) inhales softly then exhales quickly she begnat o focus one her sensory abilities. Would help to spot traps based on chakra she also pets the head of duck that was near her.

"Let's move."She said turning around and sprinting off to the east with the duck following behind her. * - Tue Sep 08 12:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Moves rather quickly but carefully as she sprints threw the area scouting for traps and other people. Beth was using her above average sight and her sensory skills to look for traps. scanning the ground for wires looking the ground for an changes to the grass. As well searching and looking nears trees to see if she could see any traps in the most common areas. She was also a smart girl sos he would thing outside of the box sensing for cakra signaturs as wellw atching her own incase she had walked into a genjutsu. Beth also made sure to try and keeps tabs on Katsune and Kilm incase they were ever trapped insid eof a genjutsu. 

Moving threw the forest was a danger already seeing as the forest poeple had many spots to hide traps. But Beth had a feeling they wouldnt run into any in this first section she feels as if they would eb set clsoer to kirigakura.. "So he plans to attack kirigakure.."She thought to her self as she moves threw the forest. She wa sure the other two would fan out a little so they would search in more wide spread fashion but as long as they were not to far away form each other Beth didn't seem tow orrie as much. 

"If things do go south this duck better know howt o kick it in high gear. LAst thing I want is to run into a squad or camp..Then again it would be fun to fight."She things as she stops standing in a tree on its brantch looking over the area. Nothing seemed to be out of order or well at elast so far. But just incase if ther ewere and she was able to pick up on it she would write it down in her scroll and move on. "Make sure to use the trees and such to keep your self hidden."She said in low tone of voice to the others hopefuly they could hear it. "I'm sure they arn't dumb."She thought.

Again stopping standing near a tree that was all clear as she took some time to rest as well serch for again traps and any signs of the enem.y As in foot prints old camp sights maybe fire pits and things like that. "Breaking down the walls to kirigakure would be a mager goal to complete."She thought as she looks out into the distance knowing they were moving closer and closer.. "Staying about here would do it. Or should we move in closer risk it to gahter more data.. Nah."She thought.

AGain she kept a close ey eout listneing to others reports as well making sure the duck that was following her would stay cler of traps incase it ended up walking off or soemtihng. Beth takes breaks to write in her scroll sketching out where they searched as well the locations of traps, and things they might have found. The forest had a cool breaze feeling to it wich made Beth feel little edgy it seemed so relax and calm and quite.. 

"Hmmm time to move."She thought moving bit more east searching for traps of course she dindt talk out loud that much and trys her best to be a ninja hidden. Out of sight and quit but she was no light foot so if she steps on a stick it would crack leafs would crumble and things likes that but she still tries to stay quiet and out of sight. Kirigakura was not some dumb villag eon the break of falling in on its self. They were rather smart peoplea nd powerful from the soudns of it. Beth knows if cought by these pople or spotted would end well. 

But with each houre that passes on during this time Beth was gathering more data and writting it down. She aslo keeps a map of where they search well a hand drawn one but she still marks down where she was and where she plans to go and stores it inside her pocket. She evne galnces tos kys wondering if the flock of ducks Zetsumo sent out would be attacked or spotted. If those were spotted then it would mean someone was posted out in the forest looking and keeping a eye out.

"My senses are getting better I can tell."She thinks to her self as she moves threw the trees and sprints from tree to tree if ont he ground to stay hidden as well keeping a low profile. "Hmm, traps and maybe more."She thought as she scanns over the land now farther east then before lookign searching. Scanning the area as well moving close to rivers or any ponds or bodies of water in the forest or area she was scouting. If camps were around they would be clsoe to water for sure but if not she still checks to makes ure it as clear of traps. 

Checking the ground for any sings of foot prints that maybe be fresh. Even few days old would be a alright every thing must be marked and wrote down in her note book. This data was important not onyl to her team but to her self. Gathering data was a hoby of hers and she enjoyed being a scout a little bit. It was a rahter drag havin gto do this but she done worse more boring stuff. "Getting hungry need to hurry up and finish."She though tot her self.

With those thoughts she began to head back to the camp sight. Or village they were in. Checking over the areas she had already looked to make sure she didnt' miss any thing. She was sure the others were right there with her. Getting back to report back to zetsumo was a must and gettingback with out a innjury was a must. But hell they could have ran into trouble during that time of scouting hopefuly not thought.

Beth moved through trees jumping from tree to tree as well trying to stay light on her feet. "Intresting."She thought to her self a she stops to writte sometihng ells in her note book and on her map before moving on heading back looking over areas she had before as well areas she may have over looked. No one was perfect sos he knew she oucld have over looked sometihng so she doubles checks and checks again.. As they got closer to to there camp or village Beth stops to take a sip of water and then move on making sure to keep a eye out for anytihng fishy..

When lookignf ro traps beth had moved leaves and looked threw bushes and such making sure to place stuf fback the way they were so there was no sign of scouts in the area. She also kept trak of chakra signatures around her or well in her rang searchign for chakra based things. Some traps could ahve used chakra some counldn't. She even keeps a close tab on th eanimals int he areas she knows there was people with summoings so those could have spotted them. She trys to make sure she wasn't spotted but if there was small animal summons int he area hten there was no use. 

"CHakra signatures all around."She thought writitng downf ew things in her note boke and mpa as she moves on keep the serch even she was heading back to Zetsumo she wante dot makes ure her double check was 100% and she had all the data she needed. She keeps moving searching hoping they were not spotted. 

"I can't wait for when we burn them to the ground.."She thought thinking about how she'll feel when they win this war. Nothing was going to get int here way soon she was going to end up takin down few targets of her own but in do time of course nothing was goign to stop her from reaching her goals not even those in her group. But she wouldnt break her loyalty to zetsumo never she loyal to him till deth and more. 

"Almsot done."She thought as she writes downt he last bits of data she had collect then quickly move to regroup with the others if they ende dup splitting up and then she elads htem all bakc to zetusmo or just moves back knowing they all knew how to get back agan her team wasn't dumb. Some of them she had the pleasure of torturing so things might be weird for few of htem but Beth treats it as if nothing happend and every thing was all good. 

"Alright guys I think that wraps things up."She said as she gives them both a nods and smile as if saying ood job and all that good stuff and such..she could really creless because this was a pretty easy mission with just high risks.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) climbs up into the tree and would make her self at home just relaxing kicking back in the tree. Reaching into her pocket pulling out her little white note book opening it and looking at the first page.. She made sure to focus on sensing chakra incase someone tryed to sneak up on her or sometihng on that level.* - Tue Sep 08 13:47:05 2015

Once more, Beth is back to training and refining each and every one of her genjutsu. By now? Most of her skills had been refined to the point of mastery, at least those that were purely illusionary. All except the most irritating of genjutsu techniques. One that continued to effect one's senses of direction. 

Quickly, Beth speds off, going into the centre of Amegakure, and eying the bustling town. A sly smirk came upon the face of the grand trickster. After doing three short handsigns, chakra is flowed into the area and runs along a widened radius. With the vast increase in her genjutsu prowess over the years, she's well equipped with utilizing the mid-tier skills in her repteroire. 

The chakra previously called upon rushes ahead, and of course fills the desired radius to the brink. Casually, thje flow of chakra saturates the region, and thus is in primed condition to activate, once someone foolish enough ad finally stepped in the required location. "Okay. . .Okay. . .Keep it steady, Beth," the youth muttered to herself. 

Eventually, she's shifting the nature of the illusion itself. It's difficult, considering the jutsu effects two senses simultaneously. This being, the sense of sight along side the sense of feeling. Those two conjoined were the most logical sensations that depicted one's 'sense of direction.' After all, in nature, there were only five basic senses, that honestly went about depicting the other mischellenous feelings that the natural world had to offer --  things such as direction, time, balance, and so forth.

That said, Beth is carefully, and keeps the flow of chakra steady. Eventually, some poor sap steps into range, as he moved to the general shopping district. Considering the massive crowd, he's unable to detect just when the technique is activated, and thus endlessly muscles his way through. All to no avail. As the genjutsu was firmly in place, the male continuously went in circles, seemingly unaware that he was in fact making no actual distance to the desired location. His stomach is growling all the while.

"Oi. . . The shop seems a lot further today. Maybe it's cause of this giant ass crowd. Gah, how is a guy going to get grub when I can't even navigate through this giant ass mob. It's like i'm going in circles," the poor citizen complains. Meanwhile, Beth's senses home in on the poor soul, with devious and humored thoughts. 'Oh how little he knows. . .' Stated the teen. The sequence was kept up for another hour or so, and by now, the boy had given up and proceeded home.

Yet more unfortunate was casted onto his life. As even in the opposite direction, the genjutsu remained consistent, and disallowed him from returning. Thankfully, in another half hour or so, Beth's chakra was beginning to feel parched. Dissipating the jutsu, she moves  away, her body blurring and soon after returning to camp. It's there that familiar faces are seen. 

Katsune and Kilm. With a yawn, the woman proceeds to take a seat while waving lazily towards the duo. Soon, practice would need to be delivered towards her clan's trait -- the Mind-Body transfer technique.

* - Wed Sep 09 13:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) takes a seat.

Her chakra to this point, continues to speed out into surrounding areas, catching the unsuspecting citizens within the technique. If those fools were caught? They'd be trapped in a block-radius wide genjutsu, that forced them to continue moving around aimlessly. It worked, considering many of the pathways appeared to be similar, and thus detecting a cycle was to be all the more difficult.

Her eyes fall onto Kilm and Katsune, and with a shrug, her mouth flaps open. "Hey. . . Anyone want to help me with my Chakra Transfer Technique? I need a test dummy to learn how to place more chakra into my allies. Y'know, 'cause I can't really use it on myself. Well. . . Without boring myself to tears," the Afro-wearing shinobi declared.* - Wed Sep 09 13:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) tilted her head.

"For why? Chakra transfer would give you energy anyway."* - Wed Sep 09 13:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) scratches her head.

"Uh. What have you two been up to?"* - Wed Sep 09 13:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) takes steps forward to be in hearing range. * - Wed Sep 09 14:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: The reason I need marksmanship and more sight . . . I plan my storm release jutsu to be very long range. - Wed Sep 09 14:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) yawns.

She aint have time for this anyway. Casually, the woman moves off to go train her jutsus a bit more.* - Wed Sep 09 14:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) takes a step forward then reaches into her holster pulling out a kunia. She looks  at the middle fo shins back before throwing the kunai. If it was to hit him he would be hit with hilt of kunai.

"Lets see if you can dodge it."She thought.* - Wed Sep 09 15:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) flicks her wrist a little and soon after the kunai she threw would have back torwards her. Once in her hands she stashes it away and pulls out a white note book. She opens it and looks at eh first page as she leans against the building next to her.* - Wed Sep 09 15:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would sigh a little as she heard Zetsumos words. She kept her gaze on the page she was looking at but would address the male quickly.

"I'm not writing I'm reading."She said.* - Wed Sep 09 15:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) quickly closes her book and stashes it inside her back pouch. 

She then pushes her self off the wall and stands up straight, she looks out at Shin and Paine then glances over to Zetsumo and his son. 

"Zetusmo summon me a duck."She said.* - Wed Sep 09 15:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Would turn to face the duck scanning over its figure.

"Yeah this should indeed do."She said before forming a specail seal knonw to Beth. Her chakr awas being gather into her mind quickly her contorl over her chakra was pretty good at her levle of skill. The duck just stands there with a confused look on its ducky face. "Now let's see how things are."She thought before injecting her own mind into the ducks. Beths body of course falls to its knees and slouches over. the duck woddles out of way to allow for the body of beth to rest. 

It then looks back to to Zetsumo and quacks at him befor eit began to take few steps on forward flapping its wings at the same time. After about two or three flaps the duck had gone air born. It reaches a good hight quickly just to circle around the air looking down at those who were training. It circles three tiems before heading off north torwards the direction of konohagakure. 

The goal was scout the area to the north for above as well if able to reach the village its self to scout the area from aobve. To see how many shinobi where there and what they were doing and if the village was heavely guarded or not. Duck hopefuly able to make its scouting run and come back safe and unseen but if things got little ruff Beth would just release the jutsu and allow for the duck its self to take on the full force of whatever may come its way.* - Wed Sep 09 15:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Flys east after heading north and kept on going keeping a clsoe eye out and if she could using her sensing any charka signatures coming to her. She travels over the land awaiting to get to konoha so she may scout that area ands ee what is going on and what have they been doing so far. To see what the troop count was as well to see the routs of supplys that may be coming in. 

"I can see every thing I love this skill."She thought as she keeps on going. Her knowledge of th emind and how to use it to her own will was wonderful. She keeps it going flapping them duck wings to get to her target. Flying and flying as well searching the area she flew through. It wa sonly about time for when she would reach konoha.* - Wed Sep 09 16:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) was flying west north now not east. (typo) She kept it going flying she was reaching konohagkure and knew she now had to keep a close eye out for tings. She searches the area quickly and takes metal notes of things she could spot form the ducks eye few. She was going to gather all the information she was going to need hoepfully. 

"HEre comes Mama."She thought to her self. * - Wed Sep 09 16:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
A duck is flying up in the sky and just mind its own buisness it would see.* - Wed Sep 09 16:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
". . . Damn."SHe thought as she saw a figure getting closer and closer it was moving fast. "Yellow.."She thought a shs ecould see the yellow hat she wans't going to stick around of course and at the same time she was still flying about but to be on the safe side she releases the jutsu she had on the duck allowing for it to take control of its on body. The duck would quack and just kind of fly off as women was no longer controling the animal.

"and off I go"She thought.* - Wed Sep 09 16:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) arrives shortly after.

The plan with the duckling had gone poorly, sure enough. She drags her feet, and stares lazily to the captive blonde. "This is the one. . ?"* - Wed Sep 09 18:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) yawned. 

She takes a step towards the side of the captive Kunoichi. Her digits press together, forming the strange formations that were needed for pretty much. . . any ninjutsu -- save a selected few. Gently, the chakra pooled together in her belly is active, and being bent to her will. It seeps into the general area, and eventually moves through Amai's pores. As if it were apart of the Ink User's actual body, the flowing chi subsequently binds to the charka circulatory system that ran rampant in one's head. Thus completing the first portion of any genjutsu. Yin Release is in abundance, clearly.

Targetting that portion of the brain, she proceeded to chew away at the gal's will. Hopefully making it certain that each question would be answered truthfully, and to the Kenryoku's favor.

"Mmm. . . What questions you want to ask?"* - Wed Sep 09 18:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) releases the jutsu at last. She heads off shortly after.

"Good luck. I don'tthink this one is worth your time, but good luck."* - Wed Sep 09 19:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Again, Beth is hard at work, willing to place the bulk  of here attention into mastering the last of her various genjutsu. This one happens to again be the Sly Mind technique -- a jutsu that effected one's sense of direction. Casually, she again is pressing her hands together, and weaving through a set of handsigns.

With the last handsealing being completed, chakra is churning around her belly, and being shifted. Rather than going to change the jutsu into a strange nature type, such as fire, lightning -- and the list goes on. Beth does a unique change. Genjutsu, at it's base, utilized simply 'Yin Release'. Which was chakra based on spiritual energy, or the mind's consciousness. Thus, the limit was simply the user's imagination.

Unlike before, she gives a great deal of care in building up the necessary energy. Her soul worked overtime, caressing, and manipulating her chakra with enthusiasm, in order to have a thick enough quantity that was adequate in casting an illusion onto the massive crowds of individuals. Not only did a bulky enough quantity had to be formulated, but the chakra had to also be calmed, or in the control of the user. After all, genjutsu was a precise art, that was predicated on the user being in complete control.

For the next few minutes, energy continued to flow about. Before long, she'd unleash it into the atmosphere. While thick, the chakra was anything but concenrtated, and thus would remain invisible to the naked eye. It flows, and creeps about, spreading liek common oxygen, and cover the general bloxck radius.

One good thing about this unique jutsu, it required no exceptional skill to capture multiple shinobi at once. Rather, anyone that was unlucky enough to step into the range was automatically caught. Typically, it took careful observation to even notice the illusion in work. And considering the target market was a crowd of citizens, and not shinobi, things were likely to go on without a hitch.

Indeed. After some minutes of spreading the genjutsu, a viel of chakra was over the block radius. It works, making sure to manipulate the senses of sight and feeling, and of course takes advantage of the fact that this entire area was bustling in ecommerce. Due to the sheer numbers, no one actually has a clear view of anywhere -- well at least, no better view of more than a few meters. Again and again, as they fought to manuever through the townsquares, the bulk eventually find themselves just going in circles.

It was cute, and brought a clown-like chortle to escape her voice box. Was genjutsu really that hard for most people to overcome? "Mmm. . .I chose a good profession to go in," Beth muttered to herself.

Regardless, the jutsu again is fiercely in effect for the next ten minutes. It brings great concern among the citizens, as they can't make heads or tails on WHY it's taking such a long time to reach areas that usually were trivial to come upon. ". . .My wife is going to kill me if i'm late for dinner. AGAIN. . ." One man notes. Beth, as per usual, kept that cheeky smirk and slipped away. Her work was done.

As she exits the general radius, the genjutsu is force to dissipate. Given enough time, the citizens that were once confused eventually can reach their destination. Much to their delight, of course. Some are fatigued, others are simply just irritated. "Finally . ."

Like a school-girl, Beth continued to grin. She's eventually out of sight, and a bit fatigued due to the constant emanation of chakra that was required. Cue a few minutes, and she's back to the usual loitering spot, where the rest of the Kenryoku typically spent their time.* - Wed Sep 09 19:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) nods.

"Why else do you think we got ran out of Konoha?" She says with a light facepalm.* - Wed Sep 09 19:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) facepalms. 

"I didn't mean like that, Paine. -- And yeah, I do. . " She says towards Shin.* - Wed Sep 09 19:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) casually. Her hand comes together, forming a ring. 

"Try that again, Paine. I'm sure you can do it," the afro-having shinobi states.* - Wed Sep 09 19:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would have walked off. "Bah. I tried. . ." muttered Beth with a shrug.

Once she was good distance away, she decides. . .Why not have a little fun? The reason for the movement was simply so no one could take advantage, and of course so no one could pin the sudden change of Paine's demeanor on her. 

Chakra builds up, and is manipulated entirely into 'Yin Release.' It represents her spiritual power perfectly, and of course governs the mind's conciousness. Using this, a sphere of sorts is created, although remains invisible to the naked eye, considering the low concentration of energy. 

She's careful with the release too, and takes time in ensuring that the strength or concentration is sufficiently powered. Slowly, more and more yin chakra is being developed, and thus a larger portion of Beth's consciousness is entrapped within that invisible sphere as well. Oddly enough, a small portion of her consciousness would linger, to ensure that she'd be awake long enough to actually cast the jutsu. Yet the bulk was already stored away.

Finally, the genjutsu-minded shinobi unleashes the jutsu. It moves forward in a straight-line, and aims to smash against Paine's body. Assuming success? Then the real fun began. "C'mon. . . land...!"

* - Wed Sep 09 19:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Mind Transfer Technique. . . success!

"That was. . .Easy ---" Beth declared. She's stop short, once the  internal scenery had been taken. Of course, rather than being in an empty plane, it seemed Beth had now entered some strange. . . asian-like temple. Equipped with an Old Man and Old woman to boot. Even while in this state, however, the brown-skinned mercenary now held complete and utter control over Paine's frame. Casually, she walked about, and even speaks, wearing a silly grin in the process.

"Alright. So. . . My name is Paine, and I. . . I like eggs!" A hand sets itself onto Paine's hips, and runs up her waist. "I'm built. . . a bit like a tomboy too," Beth states -- while still possessing the taijutsu spec's body, of course. Meanwhile, she's taking in the view from her inside, and seemed to be unalarmed. After all, mental strikes is where she excelled. Certainly, there was no shot in hell that Paine could give her the boot, right?

". .Uhm. So, this is why Paine is always so. . . Air headed? I think you be distracting her, old lady. Are you like her dead granny or whatever?"* - Wed Sep 09 20:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
While not a physical specimen in the actual world, in terms of mental things -- Beth was Queen. She doesn't even flinch as the old hag blurs. The second the kick went, a hand rises, parrying the blow. 

Why was this possible? Simple. In a mental scape, prowess were based on your will, mind consciousness, and overall mental competency. All things that Beth excelled in. With a yawn, the woman again continued her previous task, and moved to take a step forward. Subsequently, this would beckon the Dissida to her own will, and of course ensures that Paine's body moved ahead in unison. 

Insidet he Mind Scape, Beth got cheeky, and looked towards the Tai Spec's alter ego. "I get it. This is some strange world that Paine made. Odd that she pictured herself as some old woman? A groompy one at that." Internally, the Genjutsu Specialist makes her move. A right hand is delivered again, this time sending the OLD WOMAN skidding, along the mindscape. 

Arrogantly, she'd again yawn, presumably amused with the attempt Paine had put forth to resist the genjutsu's effort.* - Wed Sep 09 20:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Paine's body would have moved. Nevertheless, the girl's mind was proving to be a pain 

Calmly, she releases the technique, and thus returns to her body. The once limp figure jolts back to life, and she takes a step. One hand runs through her afro, and calmly she's walking away. "Well. . . That was fun?" murmured the illusion specialist. Assuming no stop, she's heading into the city.* - Wed Sep 09 21:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Stops as she could see Misa from corner of her eye. Beth turns her head slightly to look at the women. She nods slightly then rubs the back of her neck a little.

"Have you seen Kitora?"She asked.* - Thu Sep 10 14:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Sighs.

". . ." She is speachless at the news of kitoras death. A little bit of anger surrounds her soul but soon it turns dark and cold. 

She then looks at Misa and narrows her eyes on the women. * - Thu Sep 10 14:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) turns to face Zetsumo  she glances at him making eye contact when she does. She then glances to Zenaki and back to Misa. She then looks off north into the distnace looking up at the sky.

The effect of genjutsu works to reach far into targets mind to aid in getting informaiton or solid answers to questions the user asked.

"Ushinawa is your loyalty with the Kenryoku and most importantly to Zetsumo?"She askes the male the first quesiton of maybe many. She waits for a answer before moving one to the next questions.

"Ushinawa do you have any ulterior motives? Do you actually wishes to work in unison with the Kenryoku'? And do you have any thoughts of betrayal?" There her questions had ended she waits for the answers.
