<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) would remove her turtle shell then her bath robe exposing her body to the air. She sighs a little and walks over ot dresser leaning against it so her back side faced out.. Her legs spread apart a little, a bitof her juices run down her legs a little.

"There.."She said closing her eyes leaning her head down on the dresser..* - Thu Nov  5 16:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) thinks: S-She just doesn't want to feel good for that long. . . - Thu Nov  5 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) moans a little her knees would kind of buckle a little causing her to hang onto the dresser. She closes her eyes and just waits for Remy to start and when her thrusted in her walls quickly tighten around him so much it could force him back out. 

"F..uck..it' feels so good..."she moans.* - Thu Nov  5 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) turns around to face him looking at Remy with a smile and bit of drool on the side of her face. She knows tis really isn't her shes not a big person who lusts for sex that much but when it came to remy she caves in all the time. As he entered into her she would moan a little her face getting a tad red. Then when he moves to play with the ring her eye swidena nd she quickly moves to wrap her arms around him. Her left leg is raised up and kind of wraps around him and she starts to move her hips putting in her own thrusting speed wich she trys to go fast.

"S-stop it...I..I..can't..contorl.my..self...cum..already..."she said.* - Thu Nov  5 16:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) would open her mouth and bite down on Remys shoulder and trys to increase her thrust speed. As she does that her juices would coat all over remys dick and he rinsides as she cums again. Her juices drip to floor making a puddle again..She would break from bite and look to remy.

"Fucking, cum in me...Fillme up cum, Remy cum. Cum remy do it!~"she moans.* - Thu Nov  5 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) nods to remy and carefuly puts her other foot back on the ground and picks remy up bride style taking him to the beth room. There she washes her self off and licks remys penis clean of all her juics and his cum swallowing before getting out. She drys them both off and gets dressed.* - Thu Nov  5 17:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I'm going to head to my firneds house. - Thu Nov  5 17:07:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) A knock could be heard as hanae slams her knuckles against Zenakis home door with force to cause her self pain. It felt amazing but she doesn't show it on her face she just keeps knocking waiting for zenaki to answer. "Zenaki answer the door...Slow poke"she said* - Thu Nov  5 17:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Smiles looking at Zenaki. she takes a step forth trying to push the door open letting her self into the home. "I came to visit you silly. Wanted make sure you are doing okay."She said walkined in if allowed. If Zenaki happned to glance at her left hand she could see a wedding wring was around hanae ring finger.* - Thu Nov  5 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Blinks a little at zenakis words. She shakes her head and chuckles a little before clearing her throat. "Since when cant I come over to hang out with you?"She asked looking up to zenaki.* - Thu Nov  5 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) blinks a little staring at the door wondering how she might take this. She reches her hands back toher pouch counting her exploding tags but shook her head. Instead she knocks on the door again wanting zenaki to open it up. "Zenaki, why are you being so mean for...Open the door."She said.* - Thu Nov  5 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) shrugs her shoulders moving to grab the key she had to unlock the door. She then opens it and steps inside closing the door behind er she stares at zenaki then at the mess of a house.."So want to talk about it or are you going to keep being a cold shoulder giving bitch?"she said putting her hands on her hips and leans her weight to her left side.* - Thu Nov  5 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Just like tht zenaki had annoyed hanae a little. So she clears her throat and would stare at zenak. She watches her closely then replays the words she said to her and trys to piece to and to together. "Tell me whats bothering you...Why are you mad at me?"She asked agin trying her best not to snap right now she wouldn't want to anger her best friend.* - Thu Nov  5 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Stares at her closely watching her movements glancing at the book as was reading. Beth couldn't make out a name of it so she just stays near the door watching zenaki. "Not sure what type of problems you and Fuji have right now but..Not leaving until you talk about it with me I'm your friend..I'm here to listen to your problems and help you with them."She said, walkoing over the kitchen to grab a drink.* - Thu Nov  5 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) cracks open her nice brisk drink and takes a sip of it looking at zenaki. She lets out a little belch but just shrug her shoulders not caring really. "Oh now you just miss cold. I still don't like how your talking ot me so lighten up a little."She said, taking another sip of her drink but the whole time she next takes her eyes off of zenaki. Watching that crafty little medic closely.* - Thu Nov  5 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Belches a gain setting the drink down staring at zenaki still. She would nod her head a little it did taste pretty good and she was thinking about eating and drinking some more. "I might but no really.. I came to tell you I'm or well I did get married."She said with a smile her face getting all pink and plush she was really happy. "I also wanted to check up on you.."She said pausing before she snaps her fingers a little. "So he removed his chakra from your body."She said. Beth was staring t zenaki for more then one reason she was focusing on zenakis chakra signature.* - Thu Nov  5 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) would just shake her head moving to graba bag of chips opening them and eating them.* - Thu Nov  5 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) grabs her drink and would waltz her self over too zenakis room peeping in. She looks at her and glances at the book she was reading then looks at zenaki again. Taking a sip of her drink before clearing her throat a tad. "Still ignoring my question or you going to answer it?"She asked.* - Thu Nov  5 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Would take a step forth standing in the door way sipping on her drink. She still stares at zenaki watching her closely. "No sorry not leaving.... What book you reading?"She asked, really wondering what so interesting about that book. * - Thu Nov  5 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Would sigh taking a few more steps into the medics room moving to stand near her bed getting a better look at the scene. She glances at the book then back to zenaki wondering what the book was all about.. "Just interested in what you are up to."she said* - Thu Nov  5 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) would sit down on the side of zenakis bed and looks at her. Hanae extends her hand to gently pat zenaki on her arm  little. "Come on now zenaki. Open up to me."She said.* - Thu Nov  5 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Blinks a little as Zenaki turns over on her belly or trys to. Hanae quickly moves grip her arm and pull to keep her from turning on her stomach. "Zenaki you can't lay on your stomach."She said..She stares at zenaki and then goes over some past events in her head... "What did Fuji do to make you so down today?"she asked* - Thu Nov  5 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Eyes widen up, as she listens to Zenakis words. She oddly lets her stand up and walk over to her drawer staring at the knife she had grabbed.. Hanae shakes her head a little and would just put her hands together then placing them in her lap as she sit on bed. "Zenaki... Well I'm happy to hear your no longer sealed... But are you really going to kill your unborn  child or children.. They are a part of you zenaki, hell more you then him.. So just put the knife down please and come sit next me.. clears her throat after feeling a tad worried for zenaki now.* - Thu Nov  5 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) panics a little and jumps up a little her hands formed one seal and she readies to take control of zenaki but stops seeing her get her side. Hanae grits her teeth walking over to zenaki aiming to help her back over to the bed.. "Zenaki stop this. They are not just a piece of him but you.. Soon they'll call you mommy and make you drawings and give you flowers.. she takes a glance at zenaki side and sighs a tad. "Baka.'* - Thu Nov  5 17:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Shakes her head a little kind of sighing just a tad. "Well then have the children and just use them as dolls..But don't slotter them!" She had yelled even though hanae her self tortured and broke up several families during the attack on konohagakure but it seems she had changed maybe?* - Thu Nov  5 17:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) would walk over to zenaki trying to wrap her arms around her to hug her. "That doesn't mean you should hate the children..They did nothing wrong zenaki..They were just put in middle of everything.." trys her best to sound caring and like she could understand how zenakiw as feeling maybe this would help her relax a little.* - Thu Nov  5 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) takes a few steps back looking at zenakis hands.*"More useful? Are you kidding me?*Cracks her neck a little as she felt her true self slipping out of her very soul hanae had it. Fine then you want the child or children dead so bad? Okay toss me your knife and I'll do it for you."*Hanae had said her words cold and dark she ment every word of it.** - Thu Nov  5 17:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Takes a few more steps back just to gian a bit of distance between the two. Beths lef thand had reachd into her holster removing a stack of shuriken. "OH no, no..You want htem dead so badly just let me take care of it.."She said smirking a little narrowing her eyes down on zenaki.* - Thu Nov  5 17:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) smiles a little crouching just a little taking a little stance. "I don't want to leave just yet."she said licking her lips after her statement.* - Thu Nov  5 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) moves her left hand slightly up fannig the shurikens in it out like she was holding some playing cards. Her eyes focus down on zenaki now and her smiles gets a tad bit bigger.  I don't think I'll leave..Prehaps I'll stay."She said, her voice dark but still soft..** - Thu Nov  5 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) shakes her head a little then smirks a tad "I'm not leaving and I'm not going let you rest until you let me kill the child or you promise to have them and take care of them.Thos re your choices before this get very ugly." Hanae had said, meaning every last one.** - Thu Nov  5 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) her left hand moves up slightly. "Are you promising to keep them?" She asked* - Thu Nov  5 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) quickly tosses the five shuriken in her hand at Zenaki the shurikens were a wide spread type attack aiming low and high.. I don't belong?! I'm just trying to fucking understand you and help but you curse me and then tell me I don't belong! ZENAKI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"she shouts, her hands had came together as she starts to forma chain of hand seals rather quickly. Hanae had inhaled and quickly exhales, causing a stream of water to shoot form her mouth with a bit of force to it. It aims to crash into zenaki and wash her away into a wall or something...** - Thu Nov  5 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Eye twitches a little as she hears zenakis words. She then opens her mouth to mouth a little before inhaling deeply and then exhaling out. she cracks her nuckles a little before stuffing her hands into her holster pulling out a stack of shuriken for eachhand. Each hand held five and with little to no thought to it beth tosses them out at zenaki.

"To alte now! ZENAKI I'll fucking show you wher eI belong!"She shouted.* - Thu Nov  5 17:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Would yawn a little then she would sigh..

"Want me to stop? I'll stop if you promise to keep the child if not then I'll slotter them."She said her hands came together fomring a chains of seals her chakra building up in her hands..

"You have ten seconds to decide."She said* - Thu Nov  5 17:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) ||
"Tisk, tisk.. Wrong answer.."She said before the effects of the an genjutsu would take over Zenakis mind..Slowly fromt eh shadows and from under the bed black clone type figures of Hanae form. They move slow but all start to close in on zenaki each one staring at zenaki wtih reds eyes and a creepy smile..

"I'll let them handel you."She said.* - Thu Nov  5 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Stood there staring at Zenaki. Soon Hanae body would take on shaoe of a tall black shadow type figure. It had very long fingers that look like sharp claws. Its smile was big and its teeth were pointed and sharp. The inside of its mouth was puprle and had a slight purple ish vaper excaping from it. Her eyes were wide open, white circels and her ahir was just a black smoke that travel high into sky.

Zenaki was stuck inside the mist survant genjutsu but Beth is now able to increase the power her genjutsu letting her bend and mold them slightly..All the others figures would take on the same shape that hanae figure did.. To Zenaki it would seem all these figure swere getting closer and closer slowly. 

The figures feet, well the yhad no feet it seems just a black mist type vaper that seems to spirals around the floor. Every minute or so more figures would come creeping out from under the bed and other places in the room even the from the floors and ceiling..

"It surrounds us both the true evil we are. I have been rather nice lately again I'll give the chance to promise. That you wont kill your child or children and you will raise them be a mother to them."She said.* - Thu Nov  5 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) ||

"That post to be some sort of jab? Children from me?. That's cute really."She said, still standing in her spot the figure now reaching zenaki each one extended there hands out to grab zenaki just figure after fige all piling over to Zenaki. If she would hit them then figurs would just split into two and contenue to approach her. Each figure goal was to make zenaki mind feel like her body was in a bind of sorts as the figures held her in place..

Hanae would then take out two windmill shurikens allowing for blades to fan out holding htem by her side. 

"Now promise that you will raise the child and you wont try to kill it or have it killed by someone ells and I'll leave."She said.* - Thu Nov  5 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Raised a brow looking at zenaki. She still refuses to promise to say those words to hanae it was starting to get ot her more then any thing really. <What do I have to do..Stab her to get her to understand I'm not joking...HAte when people call my bluff.>She thought. Hanae then lifts her hands up a little keeping them horozontal with her body. She then starts to spin the windmill shurikens around quickly just looking to zenaki..

"So you promise zenaki."She said.

The genjutsu is kept in effect draining hanae of chakra every second but it's worth it. * - Thu Nov  5 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Let out a soft sigh and would nod to zenaki. The windmill shurikens stop spinning and are quickly holstered back and then Beth calps er hands together.

"Release."She said allowing for the genjutsu to end.
