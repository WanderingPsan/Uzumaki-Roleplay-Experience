<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) once out of the base ment beth goes to her room and would just flop down on her bed burying her face in her pillow. She the lets out a loud scream into her pillow.

* - Sun Oct 25 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) places her hands over the back of her head. She sighs a little and unknown to zenaki Beth eyes start to water up.* - Sun Oct 25 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) sits up and would place her hands in her lap. Tears roll down each side of her face she was upset for reasons she didn't even understand. 

"What are you doing...You are B-HANAE!. You are a great, strong, and smart young female. You are just baby slowly growing into something bigger and better. Get over your self, and get to work."She thought to her self.  These thoughts gave her hope and boosted her mood. She nods a little as she brings her thumb up to mouth. She bites down on it wincing in pain. The bite draws blood as that was happening beth quickly brings her hands together forming a chain of hand seals. She then presses her hand on the bed and would say. 

"Summoning jutsu" A seal appears on her bed then it explodes into a cloud of white smoke that vades out quickly. Sitting on her bed is a little turtle shell. "Another baby turtle."She said, as she leans in closer to get a better look."Hey you, why are you hiding in there. Come on out I won't hurt you."She said but the turtle just returns home quickly. "Oh..What no it did not just blow me off."She said, her eye kind of twitching.

"I am going to get that turtles name no matter what it takes."She said. Again she bites her thumb in a different spot. She draws blood and then claps her hands together to form the needed hand seals. Her hand again presses against the press a seal appears then a cloud of smoke. She moves her hand to the side and looks there it was again the same turtle shell. 

"Hey its rud to just dip on people. Now give me a chance little guy."She said. She stares watching closely but then it just returns home once again. Beth lets out a loud sigh facepalming her self before she bites her thumb again. "I can do this all day."She said, clapping her hands together fomring the needed hand selas for this jutsu once again. Her hand presses against the bed, causnig a seal to appear. "Oh I'm getting blood on my bed..Great."she thought as she could see the litlte drips of blood on her bed. 

Then came a cloud of smoke, she quickly moves her hand away and looks down. The same turtle shell is there , the baby one. "Hmm, you going to ditch me or talk to me. I am a friend of Sanokes you know."She said. But that still didn't stop the baby turtle form going back home. Beth would just shrug her shoulders and would back a little.

"Hmmm."She hums.* - Sun Oct 25 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Looks over to zenaki who had entered the room. Beth takes a sniff of the air it smelt pretty good. Beth would sit upstriaght and pat her lap. 

"Cool bring it over here for me. I'm starving."She said with a smile on her face. If she was handed the plate eth would set it in er lap taking the fork and knife so she could take the first bite of food quickly.

* - Sun Oct 25 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) chews, and chews the first bite before swallowing. She then moves to take teh second bite chewing it up so she could swallow it and have it go down her throat smoothly. She then uses the fork and her knife to ready the the third bite but would notice Zenaki was just watching her. Beth turns her head to side slightly glancing at zenaki.

"You didn't make any for your self?"she asked.* - Sun Oct 25 03:30:46 2015

Once they were done Beth hands slide out from slit in her cloak and are placed on Erins shoulders. She looks Erin in her eyes and smiles a little. 

"One, two, and three all done."She said. In that short amaount of time Beth had transfered over chakra to Erin, giving her the needed chakra she had lost or well near the amount that she lost.

"Teaching you it can wait. I would like to that when zenaki is here. That way you both can learn it at the same time."She said.* - Sun Oct 25 04:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) turns around and walks out of the training area. Her steps are slow and she leaves big foot steps in the sand.

"Damn this turtle shell."She thought.* - Sun Oct 25 16:42:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) walks over to side of the couch looking down at Zenaki. Hanae blinks a few times before she had a little idea pop in her head. So carefuly and really slowly she moves her hands down to zenakis breast touching them a little.

"They are so big. So big, like big old pillows of joy."She said in a soft voice. * - Sun Oct 25 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||

"She really seems out of it today."She thought as she carefully moves her hands to her side. Beth takes a few steps over looking at zenakis lap. She moves a hnd down to gently place it on her lp and slowly moves her hand closer to her inner thigh.

"I wonder how sleep she really is."She said ina  soft whisper.* - Sun Oct 25 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"Hmmm.'She hums as she moves her hands to unbutton zenakis pants slowly.

"Is she that dead sleep"She thought* - Sun Oct 25 17:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Narrows her eyes on zenaki a little. 

"Should I... She might get angery at me."She though as she carefully trys to pull zenakis pants down.

"Well I wont but I can ge ther outof these clothes so she can relax a little more."She thought.* - Sun Oct 25 17:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) moves her hands up to grab onto zenakis panties she then carefuly slides those down or well try.

"Is she really still sleep."she thought.* - Sun Oct 25 18:05:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) grits her teeth a little. She then lets out a soft sigh as she trys to remove the panties or well slide them down. It was hard since zenaki kept moving but she trys.

"this is kind of cute..."she thought* - Sun Oct 25 18:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Blinks a little as she heard zenaki vocies. She glances at her and would just have that blank expression her face wtih that anime style sweat drop running down the sid eof her head. 

"Eh. . .... I..was ..going..to..dress..you...in...some...night..clothes...."she said kind of puasing between each word..It so awkward feeling to be caught.* - Sun Oct 25 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) lips curled up into a smile.

"But you since you know...Your lower half isn't coveredup maybe you can just lean back and let me have a lick~"she said, in a joking type voice.* - Sun Oct 25 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Oh come on. - Sun Oct 25 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) takes a seat on the couch huffing a little.

"Oh well. On a more adult note. Are we going to do more of those shots today?"She asked* - Sun Oct 25 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) rubs her chest a little.

"I wasn't going to do nothing. IT was more of a joke."She said* - Sun Oct 25 19:06:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Narrows her eyes down on Erin as she approaches and then touches her. Beth watches her closely as well keeps an eye out on her chkara signature. Once Erin was done showing her how to do the jutsu beth gives a nod and would smirk a little. "Can do."She said, placing her hands together as she does each seal for the jutsu slowly. Going of by what she remeber Erin doing. Once done Beth would focus on her chakra. "Now let's see"She thinks as she trys to supress her chakra but it fails.

"Hmm, I could try harder."She thought again doing the hand seals. She focus on her chakra and slowly but carefully starts to suppress her chakra ever so carefully but would stop. Beth pants a little and would shrug her shoulders a little."Easer aid then done."She said, kind of smiling as she would again recap what erin did. She goes through all steps in her head before noding.

"Okay, third time is the charm."She said. She again forms the needed hand seals for the jutsu before focusing on her chakra. She slowly but carefully starts to suppress her chakra. Every passing second that went by beths chakra signatre would get lower and harder to trace. She smiles before clapping her hands together slowly.

"Wow, thank you Erin for this knowledge. Now it is time for me to return the favor."She stated as she would slide her hands out form the cover of her cloak. Beths hands and arms are wrapped in bandages. She would then side step to her right and turn.

"Zenaki, and Erin watch closely."She said. Her hands would come together forming the first seal, then the rest of the seals ofr the chakra transfer jtusu slowly. "Once ou have the seals done it is all about chakra control and focus."She said. Before extending her hands out. Beth focuses on her chakra forcing it to her hands.

Her hands are soon coated in a blue aura of chakra. She looks to zenkai then to erin. "Now the transfer part is tricky but if you take your time you wont have any problems."she said, walking over to Erin placing her hands on the girls shoulders. "I know carefuly place my chakra into her body."She said, thorwing in anyother little notes they might need to know to do the jutsu. IN a few seconds beth would take a step ack and would put her hands down. Letting the cloak cover them, and hide them from sight.* - Sun Oct 25 21:26:49 2015
