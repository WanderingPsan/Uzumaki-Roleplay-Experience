Once that was done she starts to walk up the tree carefuly tying one end of rope to a thick brantch that seemed strong. Once that was done she lets go letting rope drop. The rope was long so it hangs down touching the ground slightly.

"perfect."she said before walking back down to ground she yawns. She then grabs a shovel and starts to dig some of loose sand out of the way tossing it off to the side. "I'll that to make a wall of sorts."She thought as she kept digging this creater like hole into the ground mkaing it a bit wide.

"Hmm. I hate this."she thought before tossing the shovel to side she was done it didin't take much. She then walks out of the little hole she made and stares at it. Clapping her hands together forming a few seals kneading her chakra before inhaling then exhaling. A sream of water shoots from her mouth and hits in center of the hole. She slowly but careful fills it up with a syrupy type water.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Made her way out of the village with aback pack on and other gear she had that was hidden by the cloak she had on. She looks out to distance of the desert and just sighs softly. "Wonder where I'll end up."she thought, also keeping close eye out for traps as she travels because you never know.* - Sun Nov 22 18:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Takes her times walking threw the forest knowing well that kirigakura is close by as well other villages. though shes not seaking for that she is confused and just roams in search for her own path to take in life..

<This is a head ache.>She thought* - Mon Nov 23 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Sat there on the ground. right knee up and arm resting on it slightly while holding a water bottle most likely sipping of fit. Gaze watches the area around her the forest such a beautiful place but random things happen in forest.

<Would be a shame if I ended up dead out here...>She thought, before quickly looking over her shoulder watching behind her for a few seconds before raising a brow. "Guests."Hanae said before looking in the direction of two chakra signatures she felt.

Few mintuse after she is able to see two women. 

"Just passing through the idea. If thats not a problem."She said setting water bottle on the ground then standing up.* - Mon Nov 23 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) folds her arms and stares at the women. A glance given to other has hanae makes a few judgements about the duo in her head before parting her lips. 

"My destination not really important."Hanae said* - Mon Nov 23 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: ... - Mon Nov 23 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) ||

"I didn't know my parents."Hanae said notcing the hcange of the womens engery but remains calm. Even though she took another step forward. Hanae would unfold her arms slightly and clears her throat just a little. The feeling in the air it only brought back some old memories of her past..

"I do like my space."She said calmly, tapping her foot gently on the ground. Hanaes own energy starting to spark up slightly.

* - Mon Nov 23 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Allows her hands to drop down to her side a slight glance give to them both.

"What could you want with me?"Hanae asked still keeping calm. 

* - Mon Nov 23 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Watches them closely HAnae now feeling a tad excited but doesn't show it. She glances to them both each on watching closely and once she had heard blonds commint about coming willingly she smirks.

"The hard way is all ways fun."She said as her left hand slid into her pouch grabbing a stack of shuriken quickly taking a step back as she tosses the shurikens forth aiming for Bay. Five shuriken not really aimed not like hnae was trying to really do much just wanted to keep her busy for a few seconds.

Once the shuriken were tossed she took note of the chants blond was making and narrows her eyes as her hands came together going through a few seals rather quickly inhaling then exhaling a stream of liquid that moves to cover the ground. The liquid if they happned to step on it was really sticky like syrup but hanae figured they were not rookies most likely knew about the jutsu.

"Men are hard headed."She calmly said.* - Mon Nov 23 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: I must win for master. - Mon Nov 23 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Eyes move off of the blond women and loosk  to one runing. Hanae quickly moves back to step onto the water. She has been through so many fights during her past that she doesn't even need focus chakra no she just stands on water like it was normal. Like most shinobi do. He gaze is on Bay witht hat she smirks clapping her hands together before inhaling then quickly exhaling out. Bay would see a massive amount of fire rush torwards her the heat was insane not only was fire going to hit but it move to surround around her like a massive dome twisting fast to burn her to ashes.

On the other hand the blond women wouldn''t see any of that for it was all just illusion.

* - Mon Nov 23 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Again leeps off to the side keeping focus on Bay it seems the women didn't care much or broke the genjutsu. Though Hanae can sense that her own chakra was still around Bay so that couldn't be. "Tuff."She said  watching girl land on the ground.. 

"In that case."Hanae said before clapping her hands together now the flames had quickly came down apon Bay from all directions just a massive flaming ball of it Hanae goal to crush this women mind to get ot her fall..

"This is a pain."She thought.* - Mon Nov 23 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: Fire..Is nothing. - Mon Nov 23 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) ||
 "I can sense your every move."She mumbles lookign down quickly pushing more chakr aot her feet and jumping releasing chakra to aid in jumping higher up and faster. Soon she is able to see Bay appear out of the water hanae grits her teeth wondering how strong this persons mind is to still fight through such.

"Prehaps I'll just change it up."She thought before clapping her hands together the effect of burning quickly changes to strong feeling of being shocked by lightning.. Hanae now testing to see how she would react to this..

* - Mon Nov 23 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) lands ont he water and leaps back a few to gain some distance. She glances at the big ass monster and sighs a little scratching the back of her neck.

"Oh I have seen bigger."She mumbles before letting out a soft sigh.

<Hmm what to do..What to do.>She thougth before shaking her head slightly.

"Yous ure going through a lot to catch me.. Flattering but I can see when I'm beat."she said before tossing her hand sup into air then folding them over her chest.

<Not fightning that.>She thought* - Mon Nov 23 02:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hanae(Ej900) Body shakes and she trys struggle against ropes and chains that bind her. She is unsure on whats happening to her not really listening in to what Asteroth was saying because this was all just to weird for her..<this pain..This pain>she  thinks  opening her mouth to let out loud screams but it's not like she doens't enjoy it.. The pain kind of feed her inner self her true self her dark soul the evil that makes up Beth or Hnae. The true beast with inside her is unleashed and she starts to laugh. Her eyes widen up and she just starts to laugh loudly..

Though the strang change she was going through still hurt so her luaghter has groans and yelps mix into it as things on her body are being changed. Rather htis be a fast or slow prosses Hanae still struggles trying hard to get free but its a waist of time.. Her true self giving in to the wonderful feeling as her pure evil self takes enjoys the feeling of..

Of well as if it was on fire the heat of a fire only hell its self can birth. It felt at home it felt as if it had found a little piece of its self.. As time goes on it seems Hanae will to break free of htis wasn't storng at all instead more welcoming most likely do her past and just how damn evil she really was..

though once it was done fusing with hanae she would go quiet taking time to breath. Hearing the voice of Asteroth slightly she turns her head to look at her.
"I feel amazing."she mumbles

"I wonder if I'll come accrost some travelers."She mumbles landing on the ground going itno a quick roll then standing back up runing downing the land fast rather it be open or forest or even river she was making her way through it all fast.
