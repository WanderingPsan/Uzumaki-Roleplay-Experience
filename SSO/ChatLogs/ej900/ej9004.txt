<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Like getting the academy started. Handling little problems the village might have. As well keep citizens of the villlge happy. Even handling a few of the shinobi, train them, and give missions if your not around. - Fri Sep 25 16:31:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Supposedly, Kirigakure "sees us as a potential threat" according to Erebus. Using those words it sounds like nothing to worry about, but.... - Fri Sep 25 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He seemed pretty upset about it. - Fri Sep 25 16:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Well only hand full of you really got to see what It really was like to be interrogated by me. - Fri Sep 25 16:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's funny. I say I'm good at lying but I lie less than anyone else in the world. - Fri Sep 25 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not less than me though. - Fri Sep 25 16:37:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I wasn't dumb. I scouted ahead and well could see how it wasn't going to work. - Fri Sep 25 16:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: It seems to me... - Fri Sep 25 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: He wants to keep me from checking on Zenaki and Suitengo. - Fri Sep 25 16:50:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Brought her hands up to her midsection and would press them together. A few hand seals were made she does this quickly her hands are fast. Her chakra began to gather up inside her guy with each seal being complete. She is able to pull chakra but to much do to her lack of mastery of this jutsu. Once she had gathered chakra up she would allow it to rush form her gut up to her mouth. She opens her mouth and allows for the chakra to flow out but it is turned to water quickly before it is released from her mouth. It has some sort of level of power to it but not as good  as a novice in this jutsu. She sighs a little and would wipe the water from her lips before looking up at a the sky. * - Fri Sep 25 17:30:27 2015
