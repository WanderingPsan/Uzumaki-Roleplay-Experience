"Man why cold sake.."She said before walking to grab a pot as well setting teh sake on the counter. She then fills the pot up with some water and sets it on the stove. She turns that sucker on high and waits for the water to boil.

"Got to warm this up.."She whispers.* - Mon Oct  5 19:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) smiles hte water in pot had came to boil. So beth grabs the sake bottle and places tinsdie the pot but holds it. She doesn't let it set on bottome of the pot but holds it carefully. 

"Been a long time.  Now that I think of it I never had this before.."She said.* - Mon Oct  5 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Never before? - Mon Oct  5 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Woah. You missed a lot.. - Mon Oct  5 19:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: And swallow. - Mon Oct  5 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) removes the sake bottle from the pot. She blinks and wonders why she even did that maybe because she really wanted tea. AFter heating it up some she grabs a normal cup and would open the sake bottle up. Then carefully pours her some sake into the glass filling it about half way. Once that was done she sets the sake bottle down and grabs her glass and walks off. Leavin the living room ara and just walking around the house. 

"Intresting floor plan."She thought moving to look at the bed roms, bath rooms, closests all that good stuff.* - Mon Oct  5 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Zenaki . . . - Mon Oct  5 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Zenaki, who is your master? - Mon Oct  5 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) stands there looking at the door. She glancees at her cup still has yet to takea  sip from the sake. She would then sigh before extending a hand out aiming to open the door to the basement.

"I wonder whats down here. "She thought.* - Mon Oct  5 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: As I suspected. If she was sealed, surely Beth would know. Suitengu is safe and she seems to be relatively normal. But something has changed . . . whatever reason she had for this was her own choice. She wanted this. - Mon Oct  5 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would kind of turn her head to look back at Zenaki. Beth would blink a little but her arm is still pushing the door open ever so slowly.

"Curious a little. I saw the rest of the house might as well check in here."She said.* - Mon Oct  5 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hmph - Mon Oct  5 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I have things that need to be doing. - Mon Oct  5 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) pushed the door open and would walk down stairs. Her eyes widen when she saw the basement and the state it was in, she stops standing on the stares looking around. The smell of the dead and the just feeling she got from this brought back memories. Most would fear this sight but Beth has done many things that are close to this a little. Though she does turn to look at Zenaki and clears her throat a little.

"Want to explain?"She asked.* - Mon Oct  5 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Oh. - Mon Oct  5 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Well. - Mon Oct  5 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would walk down the rest of stairs to check out the bloody mess of a basement. She smiles a little and walks over tot he large drawing on the wall. She glances at it trying to see what it was.

"Oh my."she thought. She still holds the glass of sake in her hand still full of sake she has yet to take a sip.* - Mon Oct  5 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I see. - Mon Oct  5 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. - Mon Oct  5 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I still can't beleive hes dead. - Mon Oct  5 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Same. - Mon Oct  5 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Been a while now though. - Mon Oct  5 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) a tear slowly runs down the side of beths face stopping at her chin.* - Mon Oct  5 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Oh well whats done is done. *clears throat* - Mon Oct  5 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) turns to look at the rest of basement. So she walks over to th ebodies hanging from ropes and looks at them.

"Three. So are these experiments that failed or just toys?"She asked.* - Mon Oct  5 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Failed experiments. Now used as targets. - Mon Oct  5 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Well at least its just three. - Mon Oct  5 20:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) turns to face Zenaki.

"You never care to clean the blood from the walls? I mean if you do experiments down ere wouldnt you need to keep it clean?"She asked.* - Mon Oct  5 20:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: To lazy. It's clean enough. - Mon Oct  5 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Right. - Mon Oct  5 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: So what type of experiments have you done? - Mon Oct  5 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: A lot of kinds? - Mon Oct  5 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Why so intrested? - Mon Oct  5 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Just wanting to get know you better and the things you can do now. It's been a few month ssense we talked. - Mon Oct  5 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hmm.. - Mon Oct  5 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Just the standard medical stuff? - Mon Oct  5 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Wow. - Mon Oct  5 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Jeez. - Mon Oct  5 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would shake her head a little and then would move the glass up to her lips taking a little sip of the sake. She look sat the floor then looks back up to Zenaki and would extend her hand out ot rest it on the medics shoulder.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Curious. - Mon Oct  5 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: It's just sometihng I need to get done. - Mon Oct  5 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Remember. It's the first time for me. - Mon Oct  5 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: So there are risks. - Mon Oct  5 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: The risks don't matter to me...and well - Mon Oct  5 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) turns a looks back at teh drawing tha twas on the wall then looks at Zenaki.

"I want to look like a man."She whispers.* - Mon Oct  5 21:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: -smiles- - Mon Oct  5 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would follow Zenaki but does look over at the drawing again. She wonders a few things about that drawing her mind working hard as she thinks about a few things. Mostly about this basement though..

"So whos this master person you keep talking about. I never thought you would fall under someones command.. "She asked* - Mon Oct  5 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would kind of just shrug.

"Okay.."she said taking a little sip of the sake again before pouring the rst of it out into the sink.

"Nasty."She thought. She then turns to face Zenaki as her hands came together fomring a seal. "But I'm feeling a little warm inside."She said as her chakra is gathered up.

((JK on that jutsu part going to log off))* - Mon Oct  5 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"Old trick maybe but it's a trick I enjoy."She thought to zenaki before making the girl walk over to Beth sbody grabbing the colar of the beth shsirt then would drag her body to one of rooms. Once i the room she sets the sleeping Beth off to side near the wall before making Zenaki sit on the bed.

"So tell me about this master person. They got a name?"She though tto zenaki not really making her do anything odd unlike the past few times this happened.* - Mon Oct  5 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"I was going to come up with something new after I changed my life a little"She thought to zenaki. Beth makes the girl drop the bacon sticks if she didnt eat them up before this had happened. At the same time she would make Zenaki kick off her shoes then stand up to unbutton her pants.

"I'm just intreste din why you call them master...Also do you hate me for this? "She asked.* - Mon Oct  5 21:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
"I see well I was never really plannig to do this to you. I just wanted tot alk to you where others couldnt hear. I'm worried about you Zenaki.."She thought to zenkais making the medic rebutton her pants before releasing the jutsu on her best friend. After that Beth stands up from the floor and sighs.

"I apologize for doing that.."She said.* - Mon Oct  5 21:54:59 2015

She has heard of people with this skill but never eally seen it before. It was spikes her interest in the figure who was in the area so she calmly jumps up on the large rock near by and sits down to watch.

Though for others looking at her you cant tell what sh ewas doing thanks to thecloak she wears. Her hands quickly move threw a few hand seals and just like that she inhales then with a gentle exhale a stream of water shoots from her mouth. A small little wave smakcs against the sandy ground causing it to turn from a light brown to dark as the sand absorbs the water.

"Well it's nice to know Zetsumos name is truely stuck in the history of this world."She thought to her self. She glances down at Yan and other watching them for few mintuse as they train.

Her chakra pours out of her mouth and as it pours out it turns to water quickly creating a wave of sorts of water that smacks into the ground.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) takes her drink and would bring it to her lips. Tilting it up a little letting some of liquid pour into her mouth. She then sets the drink back down and swallows what little bit she had in her mouth.

"Ever thought about doing something new with your hair?"She asked.* - Fri Oct  9 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I somethimes braid it.. Put it in a ponytail.. Bun.. Whatever.. Why so? - Fri Oct  9 22:47:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. - Fri Oct  9 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: Well I might have smoe fun with her. - Fri Oct  9 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: Though she threaten to not do my surgery. But I'm feeling a little frisky. - Fri Oct  9 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Gives a glance to Zenaki seeing that she was busy braiding her hair beth would take a few spets back and then would take a seat down on the floor leaning her back against the wall. She stares at Zenkai looking her up and down.

"Does this mean I'm into girls?"She thought to her self.* - Fri Oct  9 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) hands slide into a seal, and her lips form a little smirk type smile. She inhales then exhales softly allwoing her chakra to gather up as she watches Zenaki braid her hair. Just something about the smell of pizza and watching someone play with there hair that was just so peaceful.Soon Beth makes Zenaki her target and then the jutsu was released once again. Beth seems to have gone into a little  nap as her eyes are closed and her head is leaning against the walla nd her hands at in her lap. 

Though of course if able to she was inside of Zenakis mind just there for now.* - Fri Oct  9 23:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Would now take control and make Zenaki turn off the oven. She then opens it and looks down at the pizza. <Yum.>She thoought before moving to grab a oven mit so she could remove the pizze placing it on the stove. Though she doesn't cut it she just leaves it there to cool maybe. But now she trys to force Zenaki to take a seat next to the sleeping Beth.* - Fri Oct  9 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Now with her sitting down beth make her stretch out her legs and spread them open a little. Once that was done she slides her right hand down to her inner thigh letting her rub the area gently. <Yum> SHe thought again.* - Fri Oct  9 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
<Oh I'm sorry. I forgot the drinks."Se thought letting Zenaki stand up so she could then make her walk over to the fridge. Opening it she lets Zenaki hand grab a bottle of alcohol then would let her return to her spot on the floor. Again making her spread her legs and she makes her open the bottle. Once it was open Zenaki is forced to hold in her left hand unless she fights back. As her right hand goes back down to rub her inner thigh area gently. 

<A nice gulp should get the juices runing."Se thought making zenaki take a nice gulp of the alcohol.* - Fri Oct  9 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Felt Zenaki fighting back to rubing so it woul dbe slowed down to all most stopping motion. But Beth makes her take another gulp of the drink before trying to force her to keep the rub up. This time slide her hand a little over moving closer and clsoer to that high light spot. 

<I don't believe you will. Plus Zenaki I think you hate this so much because you really enjoy it."She thought.* - Fri Oct  9 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
For now Zenaki had stopped the rubbing the right hand was doing. But her other hand sets the bottle down and moves to squeeze her left breast as well rubing the area her nipple might be.

<It's okay.>She thought trying to force that right hand to start the rubbing again now more intens then the last time. She also takes note of the bird in the window and kind of shrugs it off.

<Even the animals in this world are pervs.>She thought.* - Fri Oct  9 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Feels Zenaki really fighting back it kind of made this really fun for Beth. She trys even harder to get Zenaki to do her will.

<Why, why my dream? Telling me you don't find this fun not even a little bit.>She thought. Beth really is trying hard to get Zenaki to do her will she must get her to do this yes.* - Fri Oct  9 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Trys to fight Zenaki back trying to gain control again. As well to move her left hand down to her pants trying to get her to unbutton them so she could slide her hand inside. If this would happen then beth would try to force Zenaki to grip her pants if she had any on and pull them up. This causing them to rub against Zenakis lips or wel in between them. 

<Why are you glaring at my body. Oh, are you wondering what it might feel like to play around with it. Want a taste of my flower?"She though chuckling a little.* - Fri Oct  9 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Had quickly ended the jutsu and snaps back into her body. Beth stands up and yawns a little before grabbing her drink and taking a few sips of it. She also looks to Zenaki and extends a hand to help her up.

"You should lay off the alcohol Zenaki you get odd some times."She said.* - Sat Oct 10 00:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) |The bir dint he window scrams fast.* - Sat Oct 10 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) eyes widen her reflexes kickign int o quickly stop the kick a little but she was still hit a little bit. It stung a tad but Beth didn't mind pain so she just stands up and dusts her self off. She then glances over to the man who was showing off his katon spark finger thingy...

"So is that the master guy ou keep talking about Zenaki."She asked looking the male up and down as well scanning him carefully. She even takes a step back just incase.. 

"She cant' have friends over now."Beth thought.* - Sat Oct 10 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Stares down Fujia s he get scloser beth is on edge now but really doesn't wish to make things worse then what they are. She was about to part her lips to speak but she could sense a large amount fo chakra moving about the home. Beth feels her hands get a little clamy as she had to think of a way out of this.

"My name is Hanae but my old friends call me Beth. Zenaki here is one of thos good old friends.. Also I don't think I have broke any of the laws in this land..Thena gain I'm not sure what they are."She said.

Then out fo blue she feels the pain of sometihng in her arm as well the slight tickle of her arm going numb.

"What the hell."She shouts lookign at Zenaki.."Oh you going a little far Zenaki!"She shouts snapping a little. 

* - Sat Oct 10 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Is well grabbed by the one called master or Fuji. She stares bakc into the males eyes but the stare down he gives her doesn't seem to really to reach her soul at all. She isn't scared really nore is she shaken up other htne having been poisoned by Zenaki she felt the same.

"This is not how I thought my day would go."She thought. She then inahels slowly and exahles keeping her cool. So far she sees no way out of this and would just relax.

"Co-operate with the master? Now those are intresting words you chose there. But what do you mean by noises and do you mean by what you sensed?. It was very quiet to me."She said.* - Sat Oct 10 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
Could probably sense the chakra from Fuji being transfered over to her figure. ((unless not. not to sure on that.)). Beth could feel her leg going numb whatever Zenaki hit her with worked pretty durn fast. Beth now has a bit of a. Damn I fucked up. Look on her face but just smiles oddly.

"See now I would but I can't realy move. I lack the space you know my own little bubble of sapce. "She said..* - Sat Oct 10 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: *shivers* - Sat Oct 10 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Eh. - Sat Oct 10 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: . . . - Sat Oct 10 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Would roll her eyes a little, she didn't have much choice here.She would try to move the hand arm that was all numb form the poison slowly trying to undo her cloak. It was hard because she had one fo those good cloaks taht had buttons, clips and zippers and such. 

"If only this was the first time my body was abused.. "She thought, keeping her eyes on Fuji and also glancing at Zenaki.

"You know your post to buy a girl a drink first."She said just trying to lighten the already fucked up mood this was heading in.* - Sat Oct 10 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: butt - Sat Oct 10 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) leans againt he wall sense one of her legs were kind of going numb. She sighs a little as her cloak was undone with the help of Zenaki. Beth seems a little annoed at this point her face turning a slight red color but she still keeeps a smile on her face. "Yeah I'll need a drink."She mutters under her breath. Kind of having a flash back to her past. The first time she was ever touched by a man..That didn't end to well at all. She shakes her head a little and would slowly start to pull at her shirt trying to ge tit to lift up. Under her shirt was cloths that kept her torso wrapped up. 

"If I'm going to be forced into this then I should enjoy it."She thought. She looks at Zenaki and would part her lips to speak "Smack me."She said.* - Sat Oct 10 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: This will be good for my book. - Sat Oct 10 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Yes, get down to the skin.. - Sat Oct 10 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Inhales deeply as her shoudler is moved the pain she felt from senbon still being in her arm was indeed bad but she couldn't help to smile a little. When she is slapped her smile grew a tad its mroe of a smirk but it's working its self into a smile slowly. The pain she felt from this was a turn on for the girl..

As the bottle was brought up for her to drink Beth trys her best to suck down it all she really wanted to be drunk off her nips so she wouldn't remember this all that much. "Rr, I got to try."She thought. Though when Zenaki starts to speak Beth stops drinking holding a bit of liquid in her mouth. She would then press her lips together and kind of spit the alcohol that she had kept in her mouth out a in a little stream. It could hit Zenaki if she dind't move in time but Beth was still pissed off inside. 

"stupid idiot..You are post to be turnig over a new leaf and you get stuck in this shit. Jeez."She thought.* - Sat Oct 10 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: This dud...I don't take being touched by men... Damn I think I like girls... - Sat Oct 10 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: Sadly this strip stuff isn't my style. But I guess it's better then being dead... Rrr I need to get the fuck out of here - Sat Oct 10 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) blushes a little when zenaki kissed her. It was something she kind of wanted to do but enver went that far witht he girl. Beth couldn't help to like this was no doubt pay back for all stuff she done to Zenaki but even this a bit much. So Beth watches as Zenaki tkes off her shirt showing the cloths that was were wrapped around her body. Beth again rolls her eyes and would let out a sigh. 

"Eh, careful with my pants."She said, kind of sighing again. Beth had on a some white boxers that had pink hearts on them. She never wears panties or stuff liek that good old boxers did the trick for her. 

"Rr, I need another drink"She said.* - Sat Oct 10 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) also her body getting more numb from the poison.* - Sat Oct 10 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: I wonder how she taste...Hmm~ - Sat Oct 10 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Susu~ - Sat Oct 10 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Take note Realest - Sat Oct 10 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: -omit- - Sat Oct 10 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) inhales deeply once more as Zenaki began to kiss her again. As she slowly moves down with each kiss made Beth take in more air. She couldn't help but to enjoy it slightly she did enjoy being around Zenkai in odd ways. She then exhales slowly yet she still rolls her eyes if something was missing. 

Just before she was going to speak she felt Fuji hands touch her. Though her legs were becoming numb from the poison and Beth couldn't really feel much but she still felt that mans hands. She grits her teeth a little and trys to stare down at Fuji. "Hey, get away from there."She said, before resting her head back down on the pillow or bed. The light teasing he was doing kind of made her speachless at first. But the thought of a male touching her body in such a way was still a turn down for her.

"I...Can..See this won't end with just some light play..So Zenaki slap me again."She said. Oh how she really wanted to be hit right now. The very thought made Beth smile the very thought of being hit..

"Infact take a kunai and slowly drill it into my side."She said agian her tone changing slightly, before she puases. She trys to move her hand that may not be as numb as the arm that was already numb. Maybe she could plant her hand fimrly on Zenaki's ass in hopes to grab a handful.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Arches her head back a little as Zenaki bit down on her nipple. The pain she felt form it was such a damn rush that she opens her mouth and lets out a loud scream. Her eyes get all big she smiesl ear to ear, so much joy that she licks her lips. Soon the loud scream dies down as eh inhales and then exhales, her chest now panting as she is breathing faster. "Such a rush, yess..More, more~"She called out her hands both gripping the hips of Zenaki. "More, I want mor-.Awwh!~"She shouts a little as she felt the pain of Fuji thrusting his member insid ein on go. Though it did help that he teased her before beacuse her vagina would have been oozing the females juices getting the sheets under her wet. 

Beth couldn't help it but to arch her back now and curel up her toes as well bite down on her bottom lip. She loved most of this but hated some of it. But she couldn't just ignore most of it she really enjyos the pain and pains he feels is a plus. Evne with her nipple being bit into it gross hard and so does the other. "This is so wrong... I cant' beleive this I feel so abused...."She though tto her self..Now coming in terms with her mind she would exhale trying not to give into the pleasure of pain.

Her eyes focus on the male scanning over him closely watching his chakra as well his body closely. Her hands at very samet ime press against each other and in all most a blur she moves trhew a chain of hand seals. 

Once complete Sanoke would feel a gust a wind surround him as well as sand in circles around the chuunin level shinobi. Soon the wind would vade and sand wuold fall back down to the ground ever so slowly and gently. Beth then moves hers hand back into her pouch as she moves to gather up some supplies one could say.

"Let's see how fast he is. Looking at this dud he seems to be rather full of him self. Proabbly back that up with his skills so I should watch out."She thought.* - Tue Oct 13 04:04:03 2015

"He seems a little shaken up perfect timing."She thought to her self before removine her righ tand left form her pouch. Each holding about five shuriken. She would then quickly inhale as well tossing the shuriken out five aiming high five aiming low. As she does this she pushes off hte ground ot gain a bit of a distance to ready her sel ffor her next attack she was planning. She skids on the surface of the sand a little but is shocked at the males speed a little.

"I would think he would move faster..I'm pretty slow when it comes to reflexes and such."She thought, thena gan she opens the wide spread shuriken attack would give buy her a little bit of time though. 

Her hands onces more coming together as she moves through a bit of seals though trying ot time it right. "How much are you focusing on me boy."She though as he does the seals. 

((Pretty sure he can dodge them but my throwing speed aka rang is 6. Based off strenght my strenght be 6))* - Tue Oct 13 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Of course her seals wehre complete and the trigger was set but she was amazed at the turtle shell wearing males speed. He was fast, very fast, it made ti hard for beth track his movements all together. Her eyes don't lose sight of the dud it was all about her reaction how fast can she move. Her reflexes kick in quickly as she takes note of him closing it seems he was going for  asweep kick. 

"Non!, so fast"She thought trying her best to quickly side step over to her right in hopes she could gain a bit of distance. If able to just dodge that sweep kick by a tad bit she would be happy and table would turn a little. Her hands once more come up this time forming on seal. Most commin seen in katon style jutsus suchs as the fire ball jutsu. She inhales threw the nose and would narrow her sights down on Sanoke..

"Katon, fire style!"She would say letting the boy know that if felt liek she couldnt damge him or hurt then she was going to try. Stepping up her game with katon style lets see if he can dodge at such close rang. In just matter of seconds she exhales allowing for flames to spiral about infornt of aiming to swallow up Sanoke.
