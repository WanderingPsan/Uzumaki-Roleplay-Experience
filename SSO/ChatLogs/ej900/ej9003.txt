<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Beth.  - Mon Sep 14 23:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) reaches into her pocket and pulls out her small white note book. She opens it and stares at the first page. She grits her teeth a little and lets out  asoft sigh. She sloely sits up and glances at Zetsumo.

"Yes my Lord."She said.* - Mon Sep 14 23:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Yes, my lord. - Tue Sep 15 00:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Would close her book and place it in her pouch. She stands up and began to walk to follow Zetsumo. She did look down at the creater he mad ein the floor. She swallows bit of her spit she knew this wasn't going to be a good talk.

"That's understood."She thought.* - Tue Sep 15 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ... - Tue Sep 15 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Gaps for air as she was grabbed and then salmmed into a wall she slides downt eh wall and is sitting on her butt. She sighs a little and rubs her neck wit her right hand. Her eye's watch the man pace back and forth and then she stares into his demonic eyes.

"I apologize."She said as clear as she normaly talks. Her mind is racing with things to say to the man. But her mind is drawing up blanks here and there but she would inhale a litlte then exhale softly.

"I figured I should test the strenght of my jutsu. I needed to see how far I could take it. How much control I really have over those I capture inside it."She said. She speaks calmly trying not to show to much fear at all. Though she knew she would start to show signs of it when it came to Zetsumo.

* - Tue Sep 15 00:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) closed her eyes and took in a deep breath then exhales. Apon exhaling she opens her eyes and looks to Zetsumo. 

"Why won't you just hit me like you do the others? Isn't that how you like to punish your kenryoku memeber!"She said her voice kind of raising a little. Her mind unsure of a punishment for her self. It was like havin gto pick which switch your grandma was going to beat you with. Do you pick a stiny one or a thick one. Her eyes water up a little but she tries to stay strong to not cry for the punishment she did think of made her upset a little inside.

"I... "She goes queit she didn't want to say what she thought how could she say it.. 

". . ."She said nothing just tilits her head downa nd clintches her fists rightly as she wanted to say it but she just couldn't give the right answer.. * - Tue Sep 15 00:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) inhales in when her hair was touched then as her body was lifted up she alllows for her hands to hang near her side. Her eyes locke donto Zetusmos she had clearly pissed him off more then ever. Though when he spoke about the diea he had in his mind her eyes got wide and she parted her lips to speak.

"No."She said puasing to exhale then take another breath in. "Just shun me like you did the time I took the life of that kirigakure pirsoner we had."She said trying to get him to move away from the idea he had.. 

A tear runs down on each sid eof her face down to her chin.. Again she tilits her head down and sighs.. "I knew this would happen. Zenaki I swear you have yet to feel last bit of my mind control jutsu."She thought.* - Tue Sep 15 00:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) slowly began to move her hands so they were clsoe to each other. She bit her bottom lip a little ashse heard Zetsumos words. He was going to do his idea after all this made Beth completely worried she didn't want that to happen at all.. The thought she had in her mind could help her out a little but would just get her in more trouble.. 

"Damn it.... Yes I was a little jealous.."She thought she wouldn't dare to tell the truth or well speak her mind. She could onyl feel her heart start to pound and her blood start to boil as she was freaking out a little. Though she tries her best not to show it but the more the male works at her clothing the faster he hearts pounds and more her chest moves as she starts to breath faster.

". . ."She opens her mouth to speak but could not say a word. Just quiet listneing to her heart pound..Her hands still slowly coming closer to each other. * - Tue Sep 15 01:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Closed her eyes and pressed her hands together. She tries to calm her self down but the things Zetsumo said and his actions all kind of freaked her out. She tries her best to ignore his touch that feeling of his hand against her naked skin. 

Her soul her very soul. That dark and cold soul that thirsting for the blood of there enemies is put in a cage.. She felt his stare that deep even if she didn't make eye contact she knew what he was doing she could almost sense  the energy from the man.. ((probably can lol.))

But she was strong young lass and would allow for her own dark soul to break free of that very cage it was trapped in. She slowly opens her eyes and make eye contact with the man.

"Get your hands off of me Zetsumo... Please.."She said she hated being touched like this brought back bad memories of her child hood... "..Just let go.."She said again but in more whispered tone.* - Tue Sep 15 01:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) again sighs as she finds her self on her knees. Her head is tilted down and her eyes are staring at the ground. Her hand formed a seal as she was thinking about getting out of this in a way. But she is a bit frozen by fear the very thought of touching Zetsumo or doing things like this with the man was never something she wished for. she shakes her head side to side and closes her eyes letting a few tears run down the side of her face to her chin. Were they would build up then fall down to the ground creating a small puddle.

"Zetsumo please... Just give me another chance and don't do this... Please Zetsumo!"She said still in whispered tone but her voice gets  atad high as she was pleading or begging the man. 

At teh same time of course her chakra was spiraling about as she still had the thought to use her jutsu but the fact he said this could get worse is what makes her think twice..

". . ."* - Tue Sep 15 01:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) A eye twitches as she was slapped by the memeber. She kind of gags a little at the thoughts he has never done thise before nore has the thought been in her head all that much.

"That thing is touching me.... Why Zetsumo...."She thoughta s her mind began tos how flash backs of her past. The things the bandits wanted to do with Beth and the torture she went through. Now she has lit a fire that can't be put out now she has burned her self by playing with those flames..

She leans her body back a little letting her back rest against the wall a tad. She then just sits there looking at the grond still not trying to do any thing... But it was this or something worse so she inhales threw her nose then exhales slowly from her mouth. Her eyes a kept closed tightly as she moves to start the act but she is slow and frankly doesn't knwo what the hell she has to do.. 

"Zetsumo please just let it slide....."She begs out ina  whispered toned of voice.* - Tue Sep 15 01:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) She felt completely destroyed in a sense. She wasn't as pure as she use to be something she had kept for a very long time. Though it is sad that it was slipping but the just tate of mans flesh the feeling she was getting from it..It made her sick deep inside so much her stomach feels liek its about to come out of her mouth. She couldn't take it she couldn't do this. She pulls her head away and turns her head to the side and then turns her body to the side.

She brings her knees up to her chest and brings her hands up to her face covering it as she began to let tears soak her face and hands. She shakes her head to the sid ea little as if she was saying No. Thought she remains quiet and just tries to stay in her little balled up pose.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
felt a cold shiver run all around her body as the male got closer it seems he wasn't backing down  from this. Beth felt her face get hit be something that was wet something tht slowly ran down her face a little. She would use her hand to wipe her face and would then rub that hand onto her pants. She made sure to keep her head turned away from the zombie like member... Her lips part as she speaks her tone of voice low as she can only speak in low whispers for her fear had that much of a effect on her.

"I'm not a whore.."Is what she whispers a hand is extended out to push the males memeber to the side. She then opens her eyes to glances at the male.

"Please just stop."She whsipers again. Her eyes glossy form all the sobing she was doing..* - Tue Sep 15 02:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
just lies there on the floor she stares at the floora nd feels nothing. Whow as she now was she even Beth any more. Was she even going to be seen as the same person any more. HOw fast will the word spread about this who will know about this. 

She no longer holds tears in her eyes for that Beth was gone now. This would for ever change how Beth thought and did things in her life to come. She lies there to recover a little from her punishment once she felt as if she had done so she would move to clean her self up.

Assuming she had some way to clean her self up she moves to do it quickly. Her top was all cut up and her clothing was probably ripped to shreads. She didn't have anything to put on so she sighs.. But the girl searches the cell for any pieces of clothing that were alright and places them on...

She then stands up and folds her arms acrrost her chest and keeps her head tilited down.* - Tue Sep 15 02:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) shakes her head agreing with Zetsumo. She clouldn't even speak or look at him at this time.* - Tue Sep 15 02:45:20 2015

"Yes."She whispers agreeing with the male.* - Tue Sep 15 02:47:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Sighs a little and would turn her head just a little so she oculd get a glance at zetsumos feet. Her eyes don't make eye contact with any one at all.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would stand up slowly keeping her self cloake din the bed sheet for reasons kind of unkown as for the moment. She walks over to Zetusmo but still keeps her gaze at the man feet. Her lips move as she whispers to him.

"What are your orders my Lord." is what is whispered.* - Wed Sep 16 03:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: work and more work. - Wed Sep 16 03:28:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) turns and starts to walks towards kilm. She holds a emotionless look on her face and still remains cloacked in the bed sheet. Once she reaches the boy she would part her lips to whisper to him.

"You are first. Answer the questions honestly. If I find out you did other wise I'll kill you."She whispers her words said with no emotion at all. Though once she was done speaking she slide she lets her hands slide out of the cloak. They form a seal a with that seal she starts to cast the genjutsu. 

Assuming Kilm doesn't resist her or anything she would get to work. 

"Have you been in contact with anyone outside the village? Have you done anything to apprehend the Kenryokus efforts? Does your loyalty still with Zetsumo and the Kenryoku? Have you found a crush, or fallen in love with any one part of the Kenryoku, and if so wht is there name or names?" Her questions would seem to stop there. She of course makes to take puases in between them to ear the answers. 

She also focuses hard to amek sure her jutsu get sthe most honest answers from the boy. She could not fail she could not allow any rats to go unsniffed out.* - Wed Sep 16 03:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) squints her eyes a little at the sound of the word alter-ego. This could mean alot of bad things when it came to her jutsu. But this woul dbe delt with later of course. 

"What did Tethys say to you? How did you get away from Tethys?"She askes still having her jutsu at work of course. * - Wed Sep 16 03:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) pulls her hands apart and moves them back inside her cloak. Her eyes stare at Kilms chest a she began to focus on the males body or well his chakra signauter. She also searches for any other chakras that may be on his body incase there was a seal on the boys body. ((unless U cant sense seals in that case yeah.))

After she had gotten what she needed from that she would take a step back and walk over to Ushinawa. 

"You next"She whispers to the male.* - Wed Sep 16 03:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Your Genjutsu will have no effect on me. - Wed Sep 16 03:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But I will tell you. - Wed Sep 16 03:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I collected my sister. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: That is when I left the village. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: No effect. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Indeed. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Why is that? - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Because your Genjutsu is trivial. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: That much is the truth. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Oh tht is true it is a weak technique - Wed Sep 16 03:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I'll just have to creat something stronger for you. - Wed Sep 16 03:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: If you wish to use it. - Wed Sep 16 03:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You may. - Wed Sep 16 03:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) glances to the women next to Ushinawa.* - Wed Sep 16 03:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Even if my jutsu "wont work" Still need to do what I ordered to do. - Wed Sep 16 03:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Go ahead. - Wed Sep 16 03:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) allows her hands to slip out of her cloak a little. She forms one seal and assuming no real fight from the male she attempts to cast the jutsu onto him before she starts to ask the questions. we all know how the jutsu works by now so no need for me to type it here.

"Have you been in contact with anyone outside the village? Have you done anything to apprehend the Kenryokus efforts? Does your loyalty still with Zetsumo and the Kenryoku? Have you found a crush, or fallen in love with any one part of the Kenryoku, and if so wht is there name or names?" Her questions would seem to stop there. She of course makes to take puases in between them to ear the answers. * - Wed Sep 16 03:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: ...Why is she still asking about crushes....? - Wed Sep 16 03:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: God damn, Beth. - Wed Sep 16 03:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: My personal life on who are my love interests are none of your concern. - Wed Sep 16 03:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: For now you can keep the answer from me. - Wed Sep 16 03:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would side step over to Ushinawa sisters. 

"Your next""She whispers.* - Wed Sep 16 03:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Hm. Not sure if I lied or not during the last question. - Wed Sep 16 03:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: *Vacj - Wed Sep 16 03:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Are you gonna ask me the same questions? - Wed Sep 16 03:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Such imprudence. - Wed Sep 16 03:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) again the seal is formed ((or how ever it is for this jutus.)) Beth seems to just ignore the girls question for reason known to her only. Assuming no fight or fus sor whatever Beth works hard to get the jutsu into gear. Of course her target is Mariana and once she felt that her genjutsu was all set she parts her lips to ask those questions.

"Have you been in contact with anyone outside the village? Have you done anything to apprehend the Kenryokus efforts? Does your loyalty still with Zetsumo and the Kenryoku? Have you found a crush, or fallen in love with any one part of the Kenryoku, and if so wht is there name or names?" Her questions would seem to stop there. She of course makes to take puases in between them to ear the answers.

((ye sim copy and pasting why because fuck trying any more.))* - Wed Sep 16 04:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd be mad too if she was asking me who I had a crush on. How does that help? - Wed Sep 16 04:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: . . .I don't recall asking for your opinion.. - Wed Sep 16 04:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) her hands remain in the seal for the jutsu. Her gaze is kept on the girl but her earchs twitch a little hearing the males words. She wonders why he was trying to get in the middle of her job it annoys her but that emotion is not shown on her face at all.

"My orders are to Interrogate those in this faction."She sai her words emotionless but she seems calm. She still awaits the girls answers of course.* - Wed Sep 16 04:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Oh boy. - Wed Sep 16 04:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: She should've noticed that Ushinawa didn't want to say anything about his personal life. - Wed Sep 16 04:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Should've tried not to say anything about it. - Wed Sep 16 04:20:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: That wouldbe a plot twist. - Wed Sep 16 04:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Beth. Your job here is done, I suppose. I'll have you screen the rest as they're awake. - Wed Sep 16 04:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: I suppose, however. . .His weakness is a good thing. - Wed Sep 16 04:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) pulls her hands apart and moves them bakc inside her cloak as she takes a step back and kind of stands there.

"But I can screen her later if you wish my Lord."She said. Her eyes glance at Mariana once more as a few thoughts pop into Beths mind. Though she just turns to face Zetsumo of course awaiintg for any more orders to be given.* - Wed Sep 16 04:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: The emotional tie. . .It will ensure that he never has a prayer of a chance to catch me. - Wed Sep 16 04:29:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: So if u got kai mastered - Wed Sep 16 04:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Eyes widen for a breif seconds before she felt her body completely go num. Oh the feling she had was not a good one at all. Beth then collapses onto the ground it seems something is up. Ushinawa has unleached the dark power of the sharingan onto Beth. A bold move for the male but not really needed at all.

"I can't move. I can't talk. This is genjutsu I know that I feel it. It spowerful very powerful.. Chakra, yes chakra."She thought to her self as she began to focus on her sensory abilities. She trys to sense outside of the genjutsu focusing hard. 

If able she can pin pout the chakras around her. THe one she was lookign for of course Ushinawa. "Was it him that did this. Makes sense to be him he was very upset form before."She thought. She is struggling to break free of this genjutsu not like she was up against some childs play.

"I'll try to use kai or I'll have to try to hurt my self. Or I need to rely on others to help me. Well I can't stayed depressed any longer.. I was enjoying it to."She thought still laying there on the ground. For now she thinks and focuses on sensing chakra around her. 

"Such power.. I wish I could have it."She thinks.* - Wed Sep 16 04:58:52 2015

The time she was being held and carried was time well spent inside teh genjutsu. She had plenty of time to sense the chakras that were around hers and had gthered some intresting data from doing so. ((gotta chekc with admins first)) Of course as she wa sbeings et down Beth is trying to strong arm her way out of the genjutsu.

Starting by moving her right hand a little trying to get her hand to clsoe tino a fist. She repeats this untill she able to do so if even able. She hten trys to move her arm as well maybe a foot. Testing the real strenght of the genjutsu which it was powerful. 

"Damn this power is amazing. "She thought. Not even to worried about it all that much. She knew she had to break free of course but she really wanted to know the trigger of such a powerful genjutsu. "Oh the data I have to gather now. "She thought.* - Wed Sep 16 05:19:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) takes a seat on the ground still wrapped up inside a bed sheet but as if it was a cloak and hood. Covering her body and concealing her face from the others. Her right pokes out of the cloak as it holds a scroll in it. She sets the scroll down onto the ground and opens it up. She then retracts her right hand back into her cloak then would let it slide back out now holding a pincel or a pin. 

She moves her hand so the pin tip is pressing on papers surface. Se then starts to gently move her wrist and hand a little as she starts to write. * - Wed Sep 16 13:33:26 2015

Beth's hea dis slightly tilted down and her eyes are more focused to the ground or Zenakis feet. * - Wed Sep 16 15:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) slowly lifts her head up so she could make eye contact with Zenaki.

"Hi."She said in a very whispered type tone.* - Wed Sep 16 15:14:59 2015

"Take it."She whisperes again.* - Wed Sep 16 15:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) would release her grip on the honey bun letting it fall to the ground. She then retracts her hand so it was once again hidden by the cloak. Beth would then lean it a little clsoer so she could whisper something. SHe wanted make sure Zenaki could hear nice and clear.

"So be it."She whispers before taking a a few steps back. * - Wed Sep 16 15:26:56 2015

She tilts her head down looking at the ground, the words Zenaki said replay over and over in Beths head. After few mintuse there was a strong evil aura that surround beth it was so big that it could be felt b the others. (I assume thats how it work idk)

"Liar"She whispered to her self. Beth would then look up staring at Zenaki making sure to make eye contact.

"Let's have a duel Zenaki."She said loud and clear.* - Wed Sep 16 15:34:36 2015

Her cloak move around with the motions of her feet clearly she has shifted her stance a little. Her hands shuffle around a little cuasing the cloak to sway a little from slight move ments of her hands.

"My problem? They have nothing to with this. This about you and I. When two best friends get angery at one another they tend to get into a fight. The fight is harsh for each hit or word they to pass to one another is full of the surpressed anger they have for each other.. Though once the fight ends those friends..There bond grows evne stronger because they were able to let out some steam."She spoke her words loud and clear of course.

Beth sensory abilities re being focused on now of course she needed to make sure she knew what was going on around her. Though instea dof staying in one spot she pushes off the ground and sprints forward.

"I am not attacking any one calm down."She said. If Katsune kept with her attack she would end up getting those around Beth as well maybe. 

"Why are they so hot headed."She thought.

The massive amount of raiton charka is clearly sensed by Beth no worries hopefully before the time she was able to release the jutsu bet had already made it forward a litlte just clearly the main line of the attack.

"This what I get for trying to talk and repair something with a friend."She thought.* - Wed Sep 16 16:15:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Had kept on with her sprint but she quickly shits to the right and leaps a little climbing up the building before turning and useing suimen to allow her to stay there. Beth looks at Katsune and pants a little.

"Calm down."She said the bed sheet cloak slides down off of Beths figure and falls to the ground. Now her normaly clothing is shown and her hands are on her hips but more torwards her back.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) Eyes widen as she sees the sparks from Katsunes hands. Beth seems not to react or attempt to dodge teh jutsu. Instead she takes note of hand seals Katsune used and would place up her hands to cover her face a litlte. When she touched Beth felt her body become numb and the shock form the jutsu was amazing the pain she felt was always amazing. She doesn't scream or make a sound instead she kneels down still keepign her control with suimen but slowly is losing her focus and is sliding down. soon sh ewould fall landing on her back with a loud thud. 

"Man that's such rush." She said. Even with Katunse levle in ninjutsu beth only has medium amount of damge. (7 was the difference of our stats.) 

"It's be a long sense I was hit with a jutsu. But I can say she really has lost her own mind hasn't she."She thinks. * - Wed Sep 16 16:57:23 2015

"I never casted one genjutsu."She said rubbing her chest a little.

Well only one that may be clear is rage a slight hint of rage.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) ||
The cloak she wears seems to move around a little bit as she shuffles her hands around. They quickly went threw a chain of hand seals hidden from sight of the others of course. As the seals were being completed her chakra spikes as she quickly gathers it up into her gut. Apon the finshing seal she would pucker her lips a litlte allows for her mouth to fill up with water. A few seconds go by before a large stream of water is shot from her mouth it moves fast and clashes against the building infront of her. 

"It still needs a lot of work. Sme for my other technique."She thinks to her self.* - Wed Sep 16 20:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Beth(Ej900) stands tall with a dull expression on her face, her entire body is cloaked in a white bed sheet. Her head is as well covered by some of this sheet like a hood. The cloak fits her so she can keep her hands hidden from sight unless there are those with above average sight that can pick up a slight movements her body does when her arms or hands move. With in the cloak her hands are pressed together forming the hand seal or seals for the jutsu she wished to practice. Upon completing the hand seals, her chakra had spiraled out from her core and is gathered into her gut. 



Her gut is carefully filled with chakra that keeps a constant spinning motion going. This to represent the power of the jutsu to come for those with sensory abilities that just might happen to be focusing on Beth. The chakra from her gut is brought up to her mouth causing her cheeks to poke out. Her pucker up and would part and as they part she releases the chakra allowing it to manifest into it's true glory. The glory of stream of water that shoots form her mouth like a raging wave water that smacks into a near by wall. The water spreads out and soaks the grass and ground around the wall causing it to turn into a muddy mess.  "No good." she said knowing very well the jutsu was lacking in size and over all power. 



This of course cant really be helped unless she trains more. So she lets out a soft sigh and again her hands come together moving quickly to form the seal or seals for the jutsu. Her chakra moving threw several different chakra points in her body, only to find it's self captured inside the young adults gut. Focusing on that chakra causing It to spin rapidly inside of her gut, soon being moved threw more chakra points to reach her mouth. Once there she puckers her lips parting them and allowing for another stream of raging water to shoot from her mouth. It slams into the wall causing a little beads of water to fly into air and hit her. This being the effect of a fast moving source of water slamming into a solid stone wall. 



She shakes her head a little and would inhale slowly then exhale quickly. Her hands again coming together forming the seals needed for the jutsu. From her inner core chakra spirals out and moves threw several chakra points like of the very complex chakra circulatory system that all living things have. Her chakra again is stored inside her gut where she focuses on keeping it spinning quickly and making sure she has the right amount of chakra for the jutsu. "N-now" she thought, puckering her lips and parting them letting another stream of raging water to shoot from her mouth. Once again when it collides with the stone wall some water splashes back and gets on her and falls to surrounding grass. 



"Still not at the level I need it to be. To think of it I hardly understand my chakra nature." She mumbles to her self. Her hands once more moving quickly, with the cover of her cloak keeping them hidden. Her chakra from her core is pulled threw that circulatory system with in her body. The chakra being stored in her gut where she focuses on keeping it spinning and making sure she has gathered the amount needed for her to create the jutsu. The chakra is soon sucked from her gut and brought up to her mouth. Her lips pucker and she parts them quickly allowing for yet another stream of raging water so shoot from her mouth. It collides against the stone wall once again and a little splash effect is made from this. The ground near the wall is now soaked and all muddy. Beth is now panting a little it seems she should take a rest now and that's what she was going to do. "I'll rest but still training is important. Next is my genjutsu."She thought.* - Wed Sep 16 20:58:01 2015
