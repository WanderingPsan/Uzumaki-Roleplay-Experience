<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles at first- but finds this soon grows both disconcerting and unnerving.. and insulting- and so asserts her dominance in the best way.

Simply attempting to force her arms to stop. And succeding as she slowly pulls her arms back to her sides- still grinning lazily.

"Cool, yeah. But don't push it, yo."* - Wed Nov 11 05:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Aight. - Wed Nov 11 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks out into the center of the room- then breathes in as she forms her weapon, lifts it, then slashes down. She steps forwards- as she begins to do her swordforms in slow motion with the Nodachi of her soul- getting used to whatever minute changes where wrought by it absorbing those souls before, and keeping herself from dipping behind in skill through practice as she focuses on her swordsmanship calmly- moving with the blade and flowing behind it, humming as she works.* - Wed Nov 11 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) after moving fully though one Kata, dismisses the Nodachi. It fades into purple smoke, as Kiyoko is waking up in the back. She sighs, as she dismisses the blade, and turns to head out back.* - Wed Nov 11 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) steps into the backroom, knocking on the side of the door frame.

"Yo, Doc. You up yet? Feelin any better?"* - Wed Nov 11 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Better than I was when he was cleaning the wounds. - Wed Nov 11 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) scratches her head at the sight, sighing as she leans against the doorframe, hand twitching as she does.

"..Yeah, no kiddin... you where really out of it earlier." She muses softly, scratching her head still, before running that hand down through her hair. "....Man, but that guy, Aza, sure did a number on you.. glad to see you're alright. I didn't see what ended up happening there- but Jiki took him away alive, so I'm sure he'll be fine. Don't worry." She says- smiling gently.

There's blood splatter on her face, and on her hands. 

"Hope that guy didn't do anythin wierd while cleaning your wounds.. probably not, he seemed liek the honorable sort."* - Wed Nov 11 05:48:35 2015

"Let me go get a wheelchair for you, then."* - Wed Nov 11 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks back in a short while later, wheeling in a wheelchair towards the bed.

"This about right? Man, I'm gonna need to walk you places n'shit, aren't I.." She muses aloud as she wheels it up beside the bed. "Anyway- need help getting into this?"* - Wed Nov 11 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs and shakes her head- but smiles faintly as she shifts to help the girl into her wheelchair.

"Eh... I guess it's no biggie. Not like I can practice properly with these ribs.." She muses idly, as she helps the other woman into the wheelchair with a sigh.

"So, where to, eh?"* - Wed Nov 11 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I guess to the square...is the fact my um...my shirt is so small and I have no facepaint on ...rude? - Wed Nov 11 06:33:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: But I don't think anyone cares about the facepaint but you. - Wed Nov 11 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) calmly shrugs as she starts to wheel the woman along casually.

"So, seems we'll be spending a good while in each other's company, huh..?"* - Wed Nov 11 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And my family... - Wed Nov 11 06:34:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slightly, and continues on.

"Fair enough, yo."* - Wed Nov 11 06:38:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) wheels Kiyoko up in a wheelchair- humming calmly as she pushes her freind along in the wheelchair; humming calmly.

"So, here we are. The square. Who do you wanna talk to, or.. whatever it is you wanna do out here?"* - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) pushes the wheelchair a little further in, then lets go and heads to lean in a corner of the room, stretching out and smiling.

"I agreed to haul your stitched-up-ass around, didn't I? I'm a lotta things- but a liar ain't one of 'em." She says simply- before pushing of the corner and taking a sword stance. She holds her hands low to the waist, and focuses... before looking at Sanoke.

"So, you done here?" She says calmly- before she does anything else.* - Wed Nov 11 08:17:04 2015

"No, no she is not pushing herself around." She says- as she moves to take up the wheelchair halfway there and finishes pushing her there- but then frowns as she looks at Kiyoko.

"KIyoko! Yo! No need to follow into the bedroom- let her talk to her man, then let them come out when they are ready! Chill!"* - Wed Nov 11 08:20:28 2015

"So. Have we met before?"* - Wed Nov 11 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... Man if you're not gonna make conversation, this is going to be a /longgg/ fucking period of time. - Wed Nov 11 08:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at that- but something's off.

Despite the hopeful, corny, cheerful tone of what she's saying.. she's not really smiling at all; only halfway, and it seems.. fake. It doesn't reach her eyes as she sighs and leans back- feeling empty inside after speaking about it all... as she sighs.

"...Anyway... let's.. change the topic.. yeah..?"* - Wed Nov 11 08:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ....Uhhh. - Wed Nov 11 08:53:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs- moving to take over the womans wheelchair once more.

"Where to next, Doc." She says with a gentle smile- sighing wearily. For some reason... she just seems tired despite the smile- and it fails to reach her eyes. "I'll be happy to.. keep helpin you out, yeah? Where to."* - Wed Nov 11 09:00:35 2015

He wants strong Shinobi on hand if he snaps- not a bunch of doctors and injured people. So how about you calm down- and see it from his side of things for a moment. - Wed Nov 11 09:08:16 2015
