<br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles at that, eyeing the puppet closely, then letting her eyes look towards Gojiro, and with a sigh- she bows her head before sliding into that basic stance she was holding before as she looks towards the dual wielding puppet.

"...Hrm. I see. Well, I'm barely even a novice at close quarters combat, so my guess is that this thing will still be better than me. With that said... sure, I'm game." She says with a lax smile, as she reclines back onto the balls of her feet, short Tanto blade in hand as she analyes the thing before her, looking at the twin-katana wielding puppet warrily.* - Thu Oct 15 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slightly as the man asks if she's ready.. as she holds her Tanto one handed, and her right hand hovers near her waist. As the puppet lunges towards her, she gups audibly; the things movements faster than her own by a good deal, as she barely manages to get her tanto up in time to try and divert the horizontal slash upwards, as her other hand reaches for a Kunai that she throws towards the things center mass as she steps back, gritting her teeth as she looks at the thing.

"Phew.... this thing isn't half bad, is it..?" She murmurs, as she staggers back from the brief clash of blades with the far, far stronger machine.* - Thu Oct 15 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grunts as the brief break between her and the puppet gives her a moments breathing room. She squares her stance, reaching back to her waist with her right, as her left continues to hold the Tanto.

She knows she's far physically weaker than this puppet, far slower, and even propably less durable.. but she is, hopefully, smarter. As it approaches she does her best to try and read how it's arm is moving- watching the machination.. and then she throws herself to the side, as her left hand snatches up to push her Tanto into the side of the weapon to try and redirect it with minimal force on her part- just a brief clash of steel to buy herself a moment to get to the side, intended to elongate her dodge-window of time as her other hand grabs for a tag, but isn't quite quick enough to do more than ready it as she pulls it while dodging.

"Hrn.."* - Thu Oct 15 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces- continuing her retreat as she pulls her Tanto back to it's ready position, and throws the paper tag towards the puppet- the rolled up piece of paper drifting to the ground just beneath her as she steps backwards, grimacing as she refuses to drop her guard to the charge- instead trying to detonate the tag as it runs over where she left it on the ground as she steps back.

"Ggghh.." She grunts out- a vauge sound of effort escaping her as she staggers away from it.* - Thu Oct 15 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks as he pulls the puppet back, then heaves a sigh of relief, rubbing her forehead and sighing.

"Gyah.... that was close. I'm just smart- I'm not really all that talented or strong in combat, but.. thanks for the help. Hope that was okay- nothing else I coulda done would have actually damaged it at all, you know?" She says, rubbing the back of her head sheepishly with the hand that dropped the tag- coughing from the smoke that it blew up.* - Thu Oct 15 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Heh...Yeah...I suppose. - Thu Oct 15 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Thanks by the way. - Thu Oct 15 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: I actually got to test it out against someone alive! - Thu Oct 15 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Thu Oct 15 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So this is your first time actually using that puppet? - Thu Oct 15 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Nah...Just the first time against someone capable of defending. - Thu Oct 15 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..Ah..? Well.. I'm really just a rather average Genin, so... - Thu Oct 15 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I mean, I'm sure if that thing had actually been trying to kill me, I'd be in a bad way. - Thu Oct 15 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Nah...You did good. I'm sure you'd be fine. - Thu Oct 15 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh... I like to think of myself as fighting smarter, not harder, most of the time- y'know? - Thu Oct 15 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Heh, yeah. I agree. - Thu Oct 15 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: It's why I made this guy...and a few others. - Thu Oct 15 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I see... Hrm? Seems orders have come on in. - Thu Oct 15 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Seeyah round. - Thu Oct 15 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks into the building, then salutes and bows to the Kage.* - Thu Oct 15 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Alright. - Thu Oct 15 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Then, it's time for the team exercise. - Thu Oct 15 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Four of you. - Thu Oct 15 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: One of me. - Thu Oct 15 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .....Huh? - Thu Oct 15 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Notice the bells? - Thu Oct 15 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) narrows her eyes at this curiously.* - Thu Oct 15 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Hmm.. - Thu Oct 15 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hai. - Thu Oct 15 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You're going to take them from me. - Thu Oct 15 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: However, it's not a simple. - Thu Oct 15 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Fight me for them. - Thu Oct 15 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's a simple. . . . . - Thu Oct 15 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: -Get- them without being stopped by me. - Thu Oct 15 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You win the exercise when you take all four bells. - Thu Oct 15 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: They're in four locations. - Thu Oct 15 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You'll make a strategy. - Thu Oct 15 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Right.. - Thu Oct 15 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Your goal is to get all the bells. - Thu Oct 15 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Gotcha. - Thu Oct 15 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Howver. - Thu Oct 15 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: None of you can be knocked out. - Thu Oct 15 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I will be coming at you at full force to knock you out. - Thu Oct 15 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You must work to protect your teammates. - Thu Oct 15 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: May we leave the building to discuss the strategy without you listening in, before we begin? - Thu Oct 15 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: While simultaneously completing the mission. - Thu Oct 15 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You may leave the building to discuss. - Thu Oct 15 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hai. - Thu Oct 15 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Guys, let's have a huddle outside to figure this one out. - Thu Oct 15 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) thinks: Full force.. Eh.. This isn't going to be a walk in the park. - Thu Oct 15 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Am I in this too? - Thu Oct 15 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hai, he said all four of us. - Thu Oct 15 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Oh, alright. - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I think i'll just sit this one out... - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Oh, Shinjin me and Takeda finished th- Oh. - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: .... - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Why? - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .... - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Takeda, come on man. - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't really feel like doing this, you guys don't need me. - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I've actually got something of a solid plan brewing, and you're a big part of it! - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nonsense. We're going against the Kage- we'll need every bit of teamwork and help we can get. - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah, we do need you. - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: All of us need to participate in team exercises, Takeda. - Thu Oct 15 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm not strong or fast...what am I suppose to do? - Thu Oct 15 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Simple. - Thu Oct 15 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: You're suppose to be a team player. - Thu Oct 15 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'll explain when the Kage isn't listening in. - Thu Oct 15 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'd rather just train alone... - Thu Oct 15 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Let's go outside so I can explain. - Thu Oct 15 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Just.. - Thu Oct 15 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Trust me, okay? - Thu Oct 15 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Thu Oct 15 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: ... - Thu Oct 15 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Anyways. Before we talk any further, lets go outside. - Thu Oct 15 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods, beaming happily as she turns to walk outside, humming.* - Thu Oct 15 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. hope the other two come out here. - Thu Oct 15 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grins as everyone walks outside- beaming happily, a gleam in ehr eyes as they walk out.

"Hai! Alright guys- this is a pretty simple plan. See- okay! Amrbocio-Sensei is the strongest of us... and Hana-Senpai is by far the fastest, yeah? Meanwhile, Takeda, you have lots and lots of ability with Jutsu. So here's the idea. I'm the weak link here, I won't lie- I'm barely a Genin, and it shows.. so. Ambrocio Sensei holds Kage Sama's attention as best he can, while Takeda provides him with Jutsu support to keep his attention focused on you two, while me and Hana run to the bells to try and snag each of them while he's focused on you. Basically, split our forces between the two tasks- occupy the Kage, and get the bells. SImple, right?"* - Thu Oct 15 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Basically, you two restrict his movement and keep him focused on you as best you can, while I and Hana run for the bells. - Thu Oct 15 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I agree, that is quite a simple plan and probably the most logical. - Thu Oct 15 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: That's my student, good job girl. - Thu Oct 15 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: However, Hokage-sama is much more skilled than me in every way, you will have to remember that. - Thu Oct 15 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. Of course- he's much more silled than anyone here.. - Thu Oct 15 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I can't guarantee that I'll be able to hold his attention just on me. - Thu Oct 15 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But the idea isn't so much to be winning a fight, as to stall and restrict his movement as much as possible. - Thu Oct 15 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: He'll most likely figure out our strategy quickly. - Thu Oct 15 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Simple plans are the best, because you limit the number of factors that can go wrong, and leave things open to adaptation. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We'll just have to adapt as we go, based on how he reacts. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Oh, Ambrocio. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Mm.. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Try to calm down your anger. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: ---- - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: ------------- - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -------- - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: ----------------------------- - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Though, as I said and am Ashamed to admit... - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'm propably the weak link here, and the weakest of us in terms of raw strength and ability. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Have you seen Zeus fight? - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I might try to catch the Kage in a Genjutsu while you guys have him distracted, but... - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Also. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I have seen him fight. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I have spar'd him the other day. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I saw him take down a man within a few seconds. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: He bust his head wide open. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: The man can throw a hook faster than I can throw a straight. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Ew. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm? Yeah, we're outclassed, sure... - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But... - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We have our mission, our objective. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Who will be the runner, again? - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hana and myself will run. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: He uses lightning by the way. - Thu Oct 15 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: And is incredibly fast. - Thu Oct 15 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hana's the fastest of us, and I'm just.. not much good for anything else in this situation. - Thu Oct 15 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I believe that Takeda and I should follow near either of you, a buffer zone so that he can't just run to the side infront of either of you. - Thu Oct 15 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: It'll be easier than just jumping onto him, and him just reaching one of you two. - Thu Oct 15 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Right... so one of you matched to each runner, then..? - Thu Oct 15 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm.. I can see a lot going wrong here, but.. I guess we'll have to give it our best. - Thu Oct 15 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: We're all equals in this mission, do either of you have suggestions? - Thu Oct 15 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Don't be afraid to offer any ideas of your own. - Thu Oct 15 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Let's just wing it. - Thu Oct 15 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Well. - Thu Oct 15 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Takeda, any thoughts? - Thu Oct 15 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Not many, he had the experience, strength and tactical advantage over us. - Thu Oct 15 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I can't use doton in there. - Thu Oct 15 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Lightning does nothing. - Thu Oct 15 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: My fire jutsu would burn the place down. - Thu Oct 15 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Water is a horrible idea. - Thu Oct 15 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I can barely use my one wind technique. - Thu Oct 15 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So no...Not many ideas. - Thu Oct 15 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Don't be afraid of messing the place up a bit, as for fire though. I believe its best you avoid burning the entire building down. - Thu Oct 15 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: You'll have to protect yourself, you know. - Thu Oct 15 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: To make things easier on the runners, Takeda you should follow up on Hana as her buffer zone while I buffer Ketsuki. - Thu Oct 15 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Remember, we can't be knocked out or we fail the mission. If you begin to feel overwhelmed, we should group back up. - Thu Oct 15 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Okay, break! Let's go. - Thu Oct 15 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods her head, slamming her fist into her palm.

"Right! Let'sa dooo this thing!" She says with a bright gleam in her eyes, and a toothy grin. "Let's party!"* - Thu Oct 15 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Right. - Thu Oct 15 23:59:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) wraps one of her explosive tags around a Kunai, then tenses- holding that in one hand, and her Tanto in the other, as she tenses to run.* - Fri Oct 16 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) gulps as the Kage begins to form handseals. She seems to have been the only one not performing any handseals- instead just preparing a Kunai. She throws herself to the side, having been forewarned about the mans element of choice- and knowing she has no real means to counter anything he does- gulping audibly as she throws the tag-wrapped Kunai towards the Kage's general direction- as she hits the ground and rolls, staying low and praying to at least barely avoid the Jutsu.

That said, theres almost no way she'll be able to fully avoid it- and even the slightest exposure is likely to defeat her in a single blow. She quietly prays to avoid any stray arcs as she throws herself to the side with obviously tense fear.* - Fri Oct 16 00:20:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: W-Would this be counted as a mission reward?! - Fri Oct 16 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) gulps at this as she tumbles to land on the soft cushion, grabbing at the Senbon just where she landed. She barely has time to snatch it up, before a massive horde of Senbon begins to form around the area. Her eyes bulge with obvious fear and suprise at the sudden wave of destruction about to be unleashed, as she holds the bell in her hand close. Her eyes work rapidly- and she reaches into her pouch to grab a few Shuriken, and throw the metal objects haphazardly into the way as she ducks to the side...

Hoping that the shuriken will deflect some of the attack simply due to being metal, and thus good conductors of electricity... and more than that, hoping that somehow, Ambrocio can help her; as she has no real way of fully avoiding this technique- yet another that would certainly defeat her if it landed at all.* - Fri Oct 16 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: She uses her brain well. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: She knows that metal conducts electricity. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: However, that doesn't compensate for the force and pressure that is added onto these electric constructs. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: It'll absorb a couple and be blown away from excess force. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: If she had a shield of metal though, that could ground itself. . . .  - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: If only I was faster... and could throw more of these... Tch. - Fri Oct 16 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) thinks: Damn, Shinjin looks so good from behind. - Fri Oct 16 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Okay, just.. - Fri Oct 16 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Stay out of Ambro-Sensei's line of sight, now. - Fri Oct 16 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Just stay /out of his fucking way/.. - Fri Oct 16 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) is in the midst of darting out from behind Ambrocio- not wanting to be too close to the raging Chuunin as the battle begins. She crouches to leap up- and as she turns to keep her eyes on the target even as she uses Suimen to latch to the nearby wall and scurry up, she is caught in a Genjutsu... a most interesting one, at that.

"Kage-Sama, I like that trick!~ I'd love to learn it sometime!" She says jovially, as she pulls herself up and ducks behind the ledge, out of sight after a full moment of climbing up the wall and out of Ambrocio's way.* - Fri Oct 16 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) continues to quietly crawl along the wooden floor. She's not particularly sneaky, but she's hoping to capitalize on the distraction provided by her comrades as she crouches low underneath the lip of the the wall on the upper level. She says nothing, as she pulls herself along at a suprising pace.* - Fri Oct 16 02:20:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) continues to crawl as quietly as she can, wincing at the sound of the flowerpot shattering.* - Fri Oct 16 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Guess this is over. - Fri Oct 16 02:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So close. - Fri Oct 16 02:40:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: How long have you guys been working together as a team? - Fri Oct 16 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, poking out from behind the bannister and rubbing her head.

"I've never worked with any of these people before, Kage-Sama, outside of Hana-Senpai teaching me a few things about swordsmanship, and Ambrocio-Sensei teaching me a few things in a training session."* - Fri Oct 16 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: This is incredible, then. - Fri Oct 16 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Give yourselves all a pat on the back. - Fri Oct 16 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...I'll pat hana-Senpai's back for her.. - Fri Oct 16 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Is she going to be okay? - Fri Oct 16 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yeah. - Fri Oct 16 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Hana's durable. - Fri Oct 16 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: She's built like a rock. - Fri Oct 16 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah.. it seems like we have a guest, Kage-Sama. - Fri Oct 16 02:41:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs and turns to head down the stairs, stretching out.* - Fri Oct 16 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) looks around for her Kunai and other shit to retrieve it.* - Fri Oct 16 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sorry, Hana-Senpai- but no. - Fri Oct 16 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We lost as soon as one of us was knocekd out. - Fri Oct 16 02:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Nevermind. - Fri Oct 16 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Not fair. - Fri Oct 16 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Uhm... You? - Fri Oct 16 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh... He did say he wasn't going to hold back, you know, Senpai. - Fri Oct 16 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: W-Well! - Fri Oct 16 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hmph. - Fri Oct 16 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Ew. - Fri Oct 16 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) tilts her head to the side, then smiles as she looks at Hana, chuckling.

"So, while we leave those two to go get a room, wanna get our own?" She suggests casually.* - Fri Oct 16 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Our own for what? - Fri Oct 16 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) just smiles at Hana's question, crooking an eyebrow up playfully- likely joking, of course... right? Before she turns to look at the Kage as she's patted on the shoulder, and smiles.

"Hrm? Ah, thank you Kage-Sama... and... Hana, didn't you get the joke?"* - Fri Oct 16 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blushes indignantly at the grip on her suprisingly mature chest; about to scold the Kage for groping her, when a sudden surge of energy with a very specific goal floods her. 

Her eyes widen, her pupils dilate- and the virginal young Uchiha experiences her first Orgasm.... and then pisses herself. It's a very odd moment- as briefly, she feels really, really good. Better than she ever really has- and the next she's pissing herself. She sways back, obviously uncomofortable.

"H-hey... t-the hell was that?" She grumbles, crossing her arms under her breasts and glaring indignantly as she furrows her brow- still confused and uncomfortable from the sudden sensation, followed by pissing herself.* - Fri Oct 16 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I'll be out. - Fri Oct 16 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I have to go on a mission shortly. - Fri Oct 16 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) whispers: T-the fuck did he just do!? - Fri Oct 16 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Ambrocio can look over the place while I'm gone. - Fri Oct 16 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hey! You can't just go groping people like that..! E-even if you are the Kage, that's just rude! - Fri Oct 16 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) squeeks and nods, walking after Hana and with her, blinking a few times.

"Y-yeah.. I just.. uh... need to change my clothes... that... wierd thing he did.." She shakes her head and frowns. "Ugh, that was disgusting." She says, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath. "Anyway, right. Training or food, then?"* - Fri Oct 16 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah, we should go to the clothes store first. - Fri Oct 16 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Get you changed, and myself. - Fri Oct 16 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: And then we can go eat - Fri Oct 16 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: And then train. - Fri Oct 16 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: BOOM! - Fri Oct 16 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Who are you? - Fri Oct 16 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Weren't you back in the trainin room? - Fri Oct 16 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Speak. - Fri Oct 16 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) starts to walk along with Hana, nodding- then turning to wave at Hiro.

"Ah, Hiro-San. Heya! It's been a while, how are you?" She says cheerily.* - Fri Oct 16 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: You know him? - Fri Oct 16 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) currently smells a bit funny, and is visibly weak kneed as she walks, for some reason.

"We where just headed out to uh... well, get a change of clothes, then go have a meal before training. Would you like to join us, or..?" She turns to Hana, and nods. "Yeah, he's a freind of mine from around town. I met him a bit after our first training session, he's a pretty nice guy. He helped me out with a sparring session, mhrm."* - Fri Oct 16 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Right. - Fri Oct 16 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: He can come with, if he wants. - Fri Oct 16 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) thinks: What a weird woman. - Fri Oct 16 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) thinks: Maybe she's a social outcast.  - Fri Oct 16 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) heads outside, smiling. She turns before leaving to wave at Hiro.

"Hey. Haven't told anyone what yah told me, so don't worry. Hope you're doin alright!" she says cheerily, before turning to finish heading out.* - Fri Oct 16 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Fri Oct 16 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) whispers: Don't you have a home to shower or something? - Fri Oct 16 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) whispers: Uh... Not.. really... I am slightly homeless. - Fri Oct 16 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) whispers: Many inn, comeon. - Fri Oct 16 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: . . . . . - Fri Oct 16 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles faintly, and looks towards Hana.

"But- don't worry Hana-Senpai. I've got a plan." She says calmly, before turning to, first, purchase a new outfit- before heading into the backrooms of the building, dissapearing for a good half an hour before she emerges...* - Fri Oct 16 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright, off to train? - Fri Oct 16 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Ah, sure. - Fri Oct 16 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Let's go eat first. - Fri Oct 16 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I'm hungry. - Fri Oct 16 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) cracks her knuckles and nods, turning to smile at Hiro.

"Ah.. sorry for making you wait out here, yeah?" She says softly, bowing her head. "Anyway. Pre-Training dinner is on me, yeah guys?"* - Fri Oct 16 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) quietly walks into the resturant, holding her new cloak tight around herself as she settles down into her seat, smiling calmly.

"So, a'right. What's everyone want?"* - Fri Oct 16 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I would love some ramen. - Fri Oct 16 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. Hiro? - Fri Oct 16 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: So, Ketsuki. - Fri Oct 16 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: You might just be the genius, strategist planner out of the group. - Fri Oct 16 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles at that and shakes her head.

"Just because I came up with a simple, basic plan for todays mission, doesn't make me any kind of a genius, Hana-Senpai." She says calmly, as she waves over a waiter and quickly orders food for herself and Hana- before looking to HIro.

"And- what did you want to eat?"* - Fri Oct 16 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Mmm. - Fri Oct 16 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I want a miso ramen noodles. - Fri Oct 16 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Spice it up a bit.~ - Fri Oct 16 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles and nods. To her, treating everyone to food doesn't seem to be a big deal at all- as she calmly finishes ordering for the waiter- changing Hana's order to soup, and ordering Sushi for Hiro.

As the waiter walks away, she looks around the table and smiles calmly, cracking her shoulders.

"Anyway... Mrm.. So, Hana, Hiro. Whats up?"* - Fri Oct 16 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles serenely as the waiter walks over with three plates.

"Well, if you want to go sleep and aren't in the mood- feel free to go home and sleep, yeah? I got in some training earlier fighting Gojiro's puppets, and I can train on my own anyway, yeah? If you're tired, rest." She insists peacefully, as the food is set down for each of them, and she herself reaches for a cup of tea to sip as well.* - Fri Oct 16 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods thoughtfully as she eats quietly, eyes hovering on her Senpai as she thinks.

"Hey.. is something on your mind?" She says softly between slurps of noodles.* - Fri Oct 16 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Huh? Nope, nothing. - Fri Oct 16 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Nope. - Fri Oct 16 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Nnnnope. - Fri Oct 16 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That is the most suspicous denial of anything I have heard since Sado told me he wasn't creepy. - Fri Oct 16 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I'm serious, sweetie. I'm fine, don't worry. - Fri Oct 16 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) rolls her eyes as she continues to eat.

"I'm not blind.. but if you don't want me to pry, I won't." She says simply, as she leans in to slurp up noodles.* - Fri Oct 16 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm.. - Fri Oct 16 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. - Fri Oct 16 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Have a good rest! - Fri Oct 16 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..So, I notice you seemed a lot less talkative with her around, than you did the other night. - Fri Oct 16 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sup? - Fri Oct 16 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: She's strange. - Fri Oct 16 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: And I do not want to associate myself with the wrong people. - Fri Oct 16 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: She's a bit odd, but she's a nice enough person. - Fri Oct 16 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Not bad in a fight, at all. - Fri Oct 16 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I see. - Fri Oct 16 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Fri Oct 16 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Helped us nearly win that interesting exercise the Kage came up with, with the bells... - Fri Oct 16 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But, well.. - Fri Oct 16 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We got three outa four, on that. - Fri Oct 16 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Close, but no cigar, eh? - Fri Oct 16 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Mhmmm. - Fri Oct 16 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I see. - Fri Oct 16 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: How was that experience? Is the Kage strong? - Fri Oct 16 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Anyway. How about you, what have you been up to- Hrm? Definitly. - Fri Oct 16 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: His Ninjutsu was incredible, and his physical ability was... - Fri Oct 16 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Incredible. - Fri Oct 16 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I see. - Fri Oct 16 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I've only been training, by myself. - Fri Oct 16 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I'd like to train you, if you have time. - Fri Oct 16 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm? I'm currently open. - Fri Oct 16 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Happily. - Fri Oct 16 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Let's go then. - Fri Oct 16 05:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Shall we? - Fri Oct 16 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: So. - Fri Oct 16 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Um. - Fri Oct 16 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I'll teach you how to use a basic jutsu. - Fri Oct 16 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? What Jutsu..? - Fri Oct 16 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Do you know how to use Fire? - Fri Oct 16 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks- and then shakes her head.

"Ah.. no. It's one of my elements, but I have no training in either of them.. or much in the way of chakra control training, honestly."* - Fri Oct 16 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods calmly- as she focuses her chakra and nods.

"Right... suimen exercises." She murmurs, as she focuses intently. Her control is ironically quite low level for someone so innately skilled with Genjutsu and so studious- barely average for her rank, if that... as she focuses on holding the leaf still, and it trembles.

"Mrm.."* - Fri Oct 16 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) concentrates intently- her chakra flowing away steadily as the leaf trembles. Her chakra control is far from adept, regardless of her intellect- and the leaf, after almost a full half minute, falls from her forehead. She furrows her brow and stares at it as it falls past her nose, and tries to jab her nose forwards to catch it- only pushing it furhter away.

"Gyahh!"* - Fri Oct 16 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slowly as the second leaf is plastered. As he steps back, she takes a deep breath in. It slips- and then she forms the pads of chakra, like ripples of water against the bottom of the leaf. Her eyes closed, she breathes out- and holds it for almost a full minute this time, before it too blows away on the wind. She heaves a sigh at that, frowning.

"....Mrm. Practice makes perfect, they say, but... Hrm.."* - Fri Oct 16 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks- smiling as he walks up before going cross eyed trying to look at his fingers as he pokes her, her head bobbing back as she tries to keep an eye on his fingers. As he speaks she chuckles, calming down and nodding.

"Hai, I'll fit it into the regiment I already have going." She says simply, smiling peacefully- and then he begins to perform that Jutsu. Her eyes follow his hands movements closely, before she turns them to staring at him entirely; just in time to witness his next action, as the blossom of fire explodes from his lips and boils half the lake, it almost seems; the roaring wave of fire in turn kicking up a wave of steam and mist.

She raises a hand to shield her eyes as the fire impacts the water, eyes widening.

"...Woah. You must be pretty damn good at Ninjutsu, to cover the entire lake like that.."* - Fri Oct 16 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles and nods, pushing herself up to stand and bowing her head.

"Here's hoping, Mrm. I'll certainly keep up on the training regardless!" She says cheerily, cracking her shoulders as she rises.. then chuckling idly. "Mrm... I'll just need to fit it in with my Kenjutsu training, and my general agility practice. Wish I hadn't used one of my tags trying to hit the Kage, but.. well, that training exercise was worth it, I think..." She trails of- then blushes.

"Ah! I got distracted by tangents, apologies. So, what next- or..?"* - Fri Oct 16 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles and nods at the slightly older man... then sighs slightly as she cracks her shoulders and looks over the steaming lake, as it cools down ever so slowly from the fire Jutsu's wrath.

"Mrm... Definitly. You gotta have something to fight for, for getting stronger to be worth anything." She says firmly- a slight smile on her lips.* - Fri Oct 16 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: That's a very idealistic and noble thought you have... - Fri Oct 16 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Some people in this world though. . . . . . - Fri Oct 16 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: That something to fight for is dominance. Power. - Fri Oct 16 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .. Mrm. - Fri Oct 16 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. I've met one or two. - Fri Oct 16 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Then that makes you all the more aware. . . . .  - Fri Oct 16 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Ever since Zetsumo died. . . . . - Fri Oct 16 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: A wanderer who said that because only power changed anything, only power meant anything. Silly, really. - Fri Oct 16 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Mhm. - Fri Oct 16 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That won't let you be happy. Surviving and living- those are two entirely different things, y'know? - Fri Oct 16 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I agree. - Fri Oct 16 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: They're not synonymous. - Fri Oct 16 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: However. . . . . - Fri Oct 16 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sure, you need to survive to live.. - Fri Oct 16 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: You need one to have the other. - Fri Oct 16 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But....  - Fri Oct 16 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .. Heh. - Fri Oct 16 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I don't see much point in the other without what it is needed for. - Fri Oct 16 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Indeed. - Fri Oct 16 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I want to teach you jutsu and whatnot... - Fri Oct 16 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: So you may survive. - Fri Oct 16 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: But I do not teach you this so you may live.  - Fri Oct 16 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles at that, tucking her hands into her pockets.

"That's something I've already figured out for myself... well, I guess it could use some more thought, living... but I'm pretty happy right now, y'know? I just need to keep things going... and keep getting better. Mrm.." She chuckles softly.

"Even that annoying phony priest can put a smile on my face, sorta.... yeah. I'm real happy with Konoha, right now... here's just hoping it can stay that way, yah know?"* - Fri Oct 16 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Good luck. - Fri Oct 16 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Times... will always change. - Fri Oct 16 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That's life. The world changes, grows, moves on... - Fri Oct 16 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You just gotta roll with the blows, and keep trecking on. - Fri Oct 16 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Preferably with a smile, heh. - Fri Oct 16 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: It could be for the better. - Fri Oct 16 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Or for the worse. - Fri Oct 16 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: ---Yes, a smile.... - Fri Oct 16 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: It's very important. - Fri Oct 16 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: To smile a lot, and laugh and be merry.  - Fri Oct 16 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: . . . . . . . . - Fri Oct 16 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Even when things are sad, you gotta... otherwise, you'd be crying- and that gets no one nowhere. - Fri Oct 16 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Yes. - Fri Oct 16 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Yes, you are right. - Fri Oct 16 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: 'S why I always buy all my freinds food- to keep things happy and merry.. well, that and because I don't really have anything else to spend my money on! Hah. - Fri Oct 16 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I do owe you, from all the meals... - Fri Oct 16 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Perhaps I'll buy you a gift sometime. - Fri Oct 16 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nah, you don't owe me a thing. And even if you did, the lessons make up for it, I think. - Fri Oct 16 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: The lessons are mutual. . . . - Fri Oct 16 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I have no other way to spend my time. - Fri Oct 16 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Besides, it's sorta my thing. If I'm present, and there's a meal, your Kami-damn straight I'm paying! - Fri Oct 16 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh. Mrm, well, if you really feel that way- do what feels right, I s'pose. - Fri Oct 16 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Far be it from me to tell anyone how to live their life. - Fri Oct 16 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: You have a funny dialect. - Fri Oct 16 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles at that, tilting her head to the side with her hands and such all hidden by that cloak.

"Oh? I talk funny now, do I?"* - Fri Oct 16 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) laughs aloud at that- shrugging as she steps forwards and looks closer at the lake, slouching back casually.

"Mrm. Well, when you put it like that I just can't be offended, yah know? Mhrm, Mhrm..." She trails of, grinning faintly. "So, you don't have any other way to spend your time? We'll have to work on that, yeah? Find you a hobby or something. Ever considered whittling?"* - Fri Oct 16 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, you are the one who said that the most casual moments can be the most productive, eh? - Fri Oct 16 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm.... - Fri Oct 16 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, for me, fighting could kinda be said to be my hobby- I enjoy it enough... But... - Fri Oct 16 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That doesn't really fly usually. - Fri Oct 16 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) taps her chin, a hand sliding from underneath her cloak to tap her chin idly, as she tilts her head in an almost classical 'curiosity' expression.

"Hrm.... How about... Poetry and Calligraphy?" She suggests offhandedly, smiling placidly. She's just so bursting with a general energy and naivete, when she's happy; it's a sharp contrast from the surly attitude she adopts around the fake priest- or even the instant loyalty she seems to show around her superiors... but then.

People are always different around other people.* - Fri Oct 16 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) strokes her chin, and nods slowly.

"Hrm.. prefer more practical things, or just less intellectual?" She asks, almost probingly.* - Fri Oct 16 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods calmly, smiling gently.

"Maybe Carpentry, then? It's physical labor, difficult, and straining- but it's useful to others, and helps people. It's practical- and it's the kind of thing where once you get going, and get used to it, you can just let your mind drift away to serenity while you let your body just keep laboring on. Very practical hobby that- but maybe too practical.." She trails of, thinking.

"Alternatively, hunting animals without using Jutsu? But that's more of a training thing, even if some people do consider it a hobby... " She trails of, thinking quietly. "Hrm... Sports?"* - Fri Oct 16 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks quietly, smiling gently.

"Well, I didn't start training to become a Shinobi until much later in life than is usual, but I spent a lot of my time before I went into the academy studying all sorts of subjects. I guess you could say I'm more of an intellectual than anything- though I'm working on expanding my other horizons as much as I can." She explains with a gentle smile.

"Anyway... sports, right... well. There's... Basketball, Shield Toss, Soccer.... I'm not sure if there's any real proffesional teams of any kind around Konoha, or anywhere to play other than the training fields, but... it's a thought." She says cheerily- chuckling softly.

"Hrm.. got any ideas of your own?"* - Fri Oct 16 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) whispers: No? We'll live like a family!~ - Fri Oct 16 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) whispers: ...Maybe we should just ask him first... - Fri Oct 16 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) whispers: Fine. - Fri Oct 16 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow as she hears that, walking into the square.

"Oh?~" She says- crooking an eyebrow up as she smiles at the two of them.

"Considering adoption or marriage, Hana-Senpai?"* - Fri Oct 16 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Fri Oct 16 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Wait, huh? - Fri Oct 16 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Just talking with Takeda, probably I will adopt him. Hmhmhmhm. - Fri Oct 16 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Fri Oct 16 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I see, how adorable. - Fri Oct 16 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hana... - Fri Oct 16 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hotamoki, Sakumi(Dbzdude11) says: ..... - Fri Oct 16 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hm? - Fri Oct 16 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Can we not...talk about that in public please... - Fri Oct 16 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright alright, sheesh. - Fri Oct 16 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hotamoki, Sakumi(Dbzdude11) says: Um.. hi im from the hidden cloud village. - Fri Oct 16 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hotamoki, Sakumi(Dbzdude11) says: I need to see your Hokage - Fri Oct 16 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Why? - Fri Oct 16 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hotamoki, Sakumi(Dbzdude11) says: Um...well I want to join the hidden leaf. - Fri Oct 16 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....Hrm? - Fri Oct 16 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: He's not around right now, you'll have to wait. - Fri Oct 16 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hotamoki, Sakumi(Dbzdude11) says: Oh...well if you see him please tell him. - Fri Oct 16 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Tch... - Fri Oct 16 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Fri Oct 16 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: What... - Fri Oct 16 19:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Hi. - Fri Oct 16 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ...What is -that-. - Fri Oct 16 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: What is what? - Fri Oct 16 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That, is Gojiro, and a Corpse. - Fri Oct 16 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ...Why does he have a corpse? - Fri Oct 16 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: And from where? - Fri Oct 16 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Sado-kun asked me to carry it, heh. - Fri Oct 16 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Where did you get...the corpse..? - Fri Oct 16 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Somewhere between here and Kumogakure. - Fri Oct 16 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: That better be true. - Fri Oct 16 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Why would I lie? - Fri Oct 16 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't trust you or Sado. - Fri Oct 16 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Heh... - Fri Oct 16 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: And you have many a reason to lie. - Fri Oct 16 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Alright. - Fri Oct 16 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: I got no reason to lie at all. - Fri Oct 16 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: It's a body. - Fri Oct 16 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You do actually. - Fri Oct 16 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: What reason? - Fri Oct 16 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: For example, you could have really got that body from here. - Fri Oct 16 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I mean, it's just a dead body. As long as he's not the one who /made it/ a corpse, who cares? - Fri Oct 16 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I care. - Fri Oct 16 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: I'm pretty sure...If it came from here you should be able to recognize it... - Fri Oct 16 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Or any of ya' - Fri Oct 16 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Tch, It just better not be. - Fri Oct 16 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Heh... - Fri Oct 16 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: -- Wait, Gojiro's a gravedigger, right? That's what I assumed with how often I see him with corpses. - Fri Oct 16 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: We've had enough death here. - Fri Oct 16 20:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Only when I'm allowed to~! - Fri Oct 16 20:02:46 2015

"Anyyway.. mind if I take a seat here, or..?"* - Sat Oct 24 20:42:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slowly- listening quietly to Ai. She smiles gently as she pays attention to the woman's words. Her smile is serene, interested- concerned, even. She locks eyes with the girl who told her that she's a man, and leans forwards to look at her, smiling happily at first.

But as the story goes on, she takes a solem expression, stroking her chin quietly.

"I see... So you grew up in an unpleasantly violent place, where there was too much of it... and now..?" She trails of, and smiles- nodding gently. "I see. You seem like a really good person, Mister Ai. It's a real pleasure meeting someone kind and gentle like that, mhrm. Me, though..? I like fighting. I don't like the idea of killing anyone- but sparring, training... it's fun, you know? I know a real fight is different- and I don't like them... but, well.." She trails of and shrugs. 

"I feel like it'd be impossible to survive in this world without combat."* - Sat Oct 24 21:40:54 2015
