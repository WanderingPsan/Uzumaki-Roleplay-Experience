<br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces as rather than giving her any time to collect herself, or get into position; Takeda turns, already forming more handseals. She grimaces as she see's him stringing together more handseals; barely able to follow his hands...

As she herself forms a single handseal to flicker again; the strain on her body hurting- though not as much as it once did, as she blurs to the side; not fully escaping the Jutsu, but managing to make it to the edge, so that while she is in pain, and forced back....

She's not hit dead center, point blank; as she flickers out of sight again, and this time doesn't speak to taunt him, grimacing.* - Mon Nov  2 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces; reaching for her sword unsteadily as he rounds on her. She grimaces as she sees him casually forming more handseals; and she draws the blade he just gave her.

"Gyah... shit, this is why I hate fighting Elementalists..!" She curses; as she gets the sword out; between her and the stream, even.. but it's meaningless; the stream's force nearly shattering the iron sword even as it is restrained; indeed, the weapon barely endures the barrage of water; and provides her with no protection..

As she is flung back with a few broken ribs, gasping in pain as she's slammed against the fence; blood spraying from her lips even from the restrained blow.* - Mon Nov  2 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: G..gyah.. - Mon Nov  2 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly; grunting as she lifts a thumbs up, grimacing.

" 'm Fuckin fine... fuckin hurts, but I'l ldeal... fuck, you fucked the shit outa my sword..."* - Mon Nov  2 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov  2 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ugh.. - Mon Nov  2 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) takes a deep, low breath.

The damage is fifty fifty split between a few cracked ribs where the water impacted, some heavy bruising on the outside, and even more bruises on her back where she was slammed into the fence; though thankfully no spinal cord damage.

"Ugh. How is it, Doc?"* - Mon Nov  2 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Jeez you really fucked her up... - Mon Nov  2 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods calmly; relaxing back and letting the woman do her work; breathing in and out and just letting it happen.

"Mrm.... thanks, Doc. Good work." She says, lifting a finger in approval, chuckling faintly and grimacing as she shifts, accepting the pill and popping it back into her mouth, a motion followed by a crunch as she bites down on it.

"Ugh.. Medicine Taste... Heh."* - Mon Nov  2 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm really sorry Ketsuki... - Mon Nov  2 06:58:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So uh...think you can move now Ketsuki? - Mon Nov  2 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) carefully pushes herself to slide up the fence slowly; wincing.

"Hurts a little.. but yeah."* - Mon Nov  2 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You really can't hold back. - Mon Nov  2 07:18:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Ketsuki, since you're the oldest one, you should pay for it. - Mon Nov  2 07:22:52 2015

"So, whadayall want?"* - Mon Nov  2 07:29:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods, turning to the guy at the counter to ring everything up one by one, then ordering spicy Miso for herself as she looks to the others.

"So, Ziare. Any interests other than being lazy? And.. Nori, how are you?"* - Mon Nov  2 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm not lazy. - Mon Nov  2 07:35:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Eh. You've stated you don't feel that training and learning to fight is worth it, because of how someone will just sweep in and be better anyway, right? - Mon Nov  2 07:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That's a pretty lazy way to think, I think. - Mon Nov  2 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It's just my mindset. - Mon Nov  2 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It's more efficient than yours. - Mon Nov  2 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Running in headfirst to forcefully be the best. - Mon Nov  2 07:40:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she takes her food into the bowl and pressing it into her lap.

She yawns and looks at Ziare.

"Yeah, I underestimated you and fucked around. Heh- still, you definitly won." She admits graciously- before looking towards Rias, and waving. "Yo. Ziare, what's up? You seem bummed out by a hot chick hugging you."* - Mon Nov  2 07:49:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(Jhunt713) says: Swordwoman with genjutsu? You can combine that? - Mon Nov  2 08:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: Ziare is very intelligent...yet lacks any leadership skills... - Mon Nov  2 08:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Yeah. I just.... Ugh. Sorry, sorry. - Mon Nov  2 08:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) rubs her forehead, leaning back as she thinks.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I never thought I passed. - Mon Nov  2 08:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: And that is another reason why you fail. - Mon Nov  2 08:35:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, leaning back and looking to Ziare.

"Look at it this way. You beat me, when I spend half my time training, when you spend barely any. Why? It's not because you're stronger- it's because you fought smart. You are intelligent- and good with what you use. If you cared, if you trained like I did, you'd be incredibly strong. If you where willing to take risks, you could be a good leader through sheer strategy. But you don't care, and you don't wanna risk it- you'd rather be comfortable and happy. Right? That's what Takeda meant."* - Mon Nov  2 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Rias, Sit down a sec. - Mon Nov  2 08:40:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(Jhunt713) says: ok - Mon Nov  2 08:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: I hate when people berrate me to train, I know I can be strong if I applied myself... - Mon Nov  2 08:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Right...Where to start. - Mon Nov  2 08:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm guessing I can't pass on this? - Mon Nov  2 08:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: No. - Mon Nov  2 08:42:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..Yeah. Shit, I just realized I wasn't even... - Mon Nov  2 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: And quite possibly the most important reason, tensions with Suna are not the best. - Mon Nov  2 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .... God, he must feel like shit right now. - Mon Nov  2 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: He's trying his hardest to work with Suna right now, so he's gone a lot. - Mon Nov  2 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Plus the Gezo call on him quite regularly. - Mon Nov  2 08:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I assume stay out of his way. - Mon Nov  2 08:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Me and the Hokage have it under control, we just need you guys to keep getting stronger for this village. - Mon Nov  2 08:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: As for the village itself, changes are going to be happening. - Mon Nov  2 08:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Quite radical changes. - Mon Nov  2 08:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(Jhunt713) says: That sounds fun - Mon Nov  2 08:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I can't really say what these are, just know they're coming. - Mon Nov  2 08:46:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) hums as she walks along the trip with the Caravan towards Sunagakure, sitting atop one of the wagons in the Caravan as she hums; two swords at her hip, a Tanto at her other hip, and all manner of weapons hidden in her coat. She's humming happily as she rides along- but eventually, the Caravan reaches it's destination, and she hops free of it; forming a handseal and flickering to the ground casually as she does.

"Thanks for the ride, guys!" She says as she wavers; slightly dizzy from her use of Shunshin to leave, but not much.* - Mon Nov  2 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stretches out after catching her breath- and turns to walk towards the village of Sunagakure now..* - Mon Nov  2 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) looks around upon entering Sunagakure, rubbing the back of her head idly as she surveys the huge stone walls.

"Mrm.."* - Mon Nov  2 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Sorry I'm late. - Mon Nov  2 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's no problem... Heh.  - Mon Nov  2 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) surges forwards suddenly; stepping forwards to embrace Ai and smiling warmly.

"It's good to see you again, Ai."* - Mon Nov  2 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) squeezes Ai tight against herself, and sighs gently as she holds her for a moment- wordless at first... before speaking up softly.

"And I've been so worried. Has Edge attacked already and you won, or are you still waiting..?" She murmurs- obvious concern in her tone.* - Mon Nov  2 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) squeezes tighter before stepping back and letting go; smiling gently at her lover.

"...Alright then. So, how about you show me around?"* - Mon Nov  2 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Alright.~ - Mon Nov  2 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Bryson, still up? - Mon Nov  2 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Phew.. sure got a lot of people around here. - Mon Nov  2 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mmmhm but this isn't everyone. - Mon Nov  2 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Jeez.. - Mon Nov  2 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hmm... I guess I'll have to wait. - Mon Nov  2 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Wait on? - Mon Nov  2 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hmm  Ortho showing me some Lightning stufff. - Mon Nov  2 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Like Is that element really that rare. - Mon Nov  2 23:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Mon Nov  2 23:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Not really, I think. - Mon Nov  2 23:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: It seems to be the case around here. - Mon Nov  2 23:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: The others are sleeping I guess. - Mon Nov  2 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: S'pose so.. - Mon Nov  2 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So, how have you been? - Mon Nov  2 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: So..So. - Mon Nov  2 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slightly as she slides into a seat.

"So so, huh..? Anything wrong..?"* - Mon Nov  2 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yes and no. - Mon Nov  2 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Tell me whats up, Ai. - Mon Nov  2 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Nothing much..Been doing B and C Rank missions... - Mon Nov  2 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Had to kill or assist with killing during them.. - Mon Nov  2 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: A'right then. - Mon Nov  2 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hope it went smoothly. - Mon Nov  2 23:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) seems unbothered by the mention of killing people on missions, as she smiles gently.

"At least you got out of it safely."* - Mon Nov  2 23:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Eh....Removing someone's head kinda...Affect me menally, ya' know.  - Mon Nov  2 23:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Mrm.. Your first kill, then..? - Mon Nov  2 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It gets easier. - Mon Nov  2 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Not my first.. - Mon Nov  2 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Just...My worse.. - Mon Nov  2 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... why? - Mon Nov  2 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: She.. - Mon Nov  2 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Had to 'fight' for her survival... - Mon Nov  2 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: A'right, so..? So do we all, in the end. - Mon Nov  2 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Not what I meant... - Mon Nov  2 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Then explain properly. - Mon Nov  2 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I can't read minds, y'know! - Mon Nov  2 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly, still smiling.* - Mon Nov  2 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: She was in no condition to be fighting...You know..I kinda had a choice if I should have killed her or not...Accept the mission..Or not..In the end, her final expression after..I remove'd her heac..She was staring directly at me, with a shock'd expression. - Mon Nov  2 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So she really didn't expect you to kill her..? - Mon Nov  2 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: No..She didn't want to fight me and I could have reject the mission.. - Mon Nov  2 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, leaning back and staring at Ai quietly. Her expression is thoughtful- then she speaks up calmly.

"Would she have simply had to fight someone else instead had you turned down?" She inquires calmly.* - Mon Nov  2 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Because if she was slated to die anyway, all that you changed was who swung the blade. - Mon Nov  2 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: She would have died..Yeah or live to see her 30s. - Mon Nov  2 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares at Ai- then nods calmly.

"So what." She says bluntly, crossing her arms as she leans into the table, sighing. "It sucks, yeah. But guess what? It was your job as a Shinobi. Your Kage must have had his reasons for ordering it- and I doubt it was as simple as a loyalty test, either. That was someone your village's leader felt needed to die; so it was your job to kill them. Deal with it." She says simply. "Being given the option to deny the mission was just a loyalty test, I assure you."* - Mon Nov  2 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Sake..I forget that helps to drown away sorrows.. - Mon Nov  2 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, leaning back at that- and frowning.

"I know- you're a pacifist at heart. You don't want to fight, to kill... sometimes, I wonder why someone so gentle and kind hearted is a Shinobi at all, you know..? But still.." She trails of. "Unless you choose to retire, you'll have to kill people every now and then. Much less than a normal Shinobi, if you try hard to avoid it- but it's inevitable that some lives will be taken. That's... that's life, and it's sad, I know." She says gently, sighing.

"....But.... it's the way the world works."* - Mon Nov  2 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slightly.

"Right. At the very least, you have to stay until your village is safe from Edge, yeah?" She says simply- nodding. "I can understand.. sort of. Even if I'd never consider retiring while I was still capable of the job, I know you don't feel the same way about being a Shinobi..."* - Mon Nov  2 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I see.. - Tue Nov  3 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, I guess I get that, mhrm. - Tue Nov  3 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You would need to at least be a Jounin to retire, right? - Tue Nov  3 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mmhm. - Tue Nov  3 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'm a Genin so.. - Tue Nov  3 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I have a long way to go.. - Tue Nov  3 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... Yeah. - Tue Nov  3 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: And...Sorry I drop'd my load on you. - Tue Nov  3 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Don't worry about it- what are freinds and lovers for, huh? - Tue Nov  3 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yeaah, - Tue Nov  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: What about you? - Tue Nov  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm..? - Tue Nov  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Anything you want to talk about? - Tue Nov  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I've been training alot.. I've met a few people and met a few freinds around Konoha- but really.. - Tue Nov  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....Nothing that I can discuss in public. - Tue Nov  3 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: At home then? - Tue Nov  3 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sure. - Tue Nov  3 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Lets go. - Tue Nov  3 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Lead the way. - Tue Nov  3 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Here we are. - Tue Nov  3 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's nice... - Tue Nov  3 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. - Tue Nov  3 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles gently, before moving to sit down on one of the soft purple cushions cross legged... and sighing as she faceplants into the table.

"Ugh... Takeda is going to get himself killed because Zeus doesn't have the time to be a proper Kage, and thus Takeda intends to take the private exam..."* - Tue Nov  3 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....With the Gezo. - Tue Nov  3 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He wants to take the exam to become a Gezo Private - Tue Nov  3 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So that he can later become a legal Hokage for Zeus. - Tue Nov  3 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But the test is to fight ten men at once, to the death. - Tue Nov  3 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .... You can understand why I'm worried, yeah? - Tue Nov  3 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ....... - Tue Nov  3 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ....Gezo.. - Tue Nov  3 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Oh fuck.. - Tue Nov  3 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: He's dead.. - Tue Nov  3 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...As good as, once he takes that test. - Tue Nov  3 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Gezo are normally consider'd...A Rank..S Rank..They'll break him.. - Tue Nov  3 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Oh, no. The test isn't fighting ten Gezo. - Tue Nov  3 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But it is fighting ten other Shinobi at once. - Tue Nov  3 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Him on ten or free for all? - Tue Nov  3 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .....Still... even if he is a Ninjutsu Genius, with affinity for every element... - Tue Nov  3 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Him on Ten. - Tue Nov  3 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He has skill in every element, and jutsu of all sorts- but I'm terrified it still won't be enough. - Tue Nov  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ... - Tue Nov  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Sweetie. - Tue Nov  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You know.. - Tue Nov  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Because he's skill'd in every element doesn't mean he'll last a moment.. - Tue Nov  3 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's an impressive trait; having that many strong Ninjutsu, and enough flexibility for all kinds of situation- but yes. - Tue Nov  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I am /well fucking aware/ it probably won't mean a damn thing. - Tue Nov  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: My sensei is able to use a seal that reflects elemental ninjutsu. - Tue Nov  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I half think Zeus is forcing him to take it just to make sure he dies, because I think Zeus blames him for Hana-Sensei's suicide. - Tue Nov  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: On the other hand- people have passed the test before.. - Tue Nov  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: --.... - Tue Nov  3 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So him passing it is possible. - Tue Nov  3 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: What are the ranks of who pass'd? - Tue Nov  3 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I have no idea.. - Tue Nov  3 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But a Sargaent, which is the rank above private, is Kage level. - Tue Nov  3 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So I'd presume Chuunin and Jounin.. - Tue Nov  3 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And Takeda is a Genin. As I said- I'm sure he'll die. - Tue Nov  3 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Want..Me to save him? - Tue Nov  3 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .... No. - Tue Nov  3 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That would be wrong, and he wouldn't want that. He's doing this.. for the sake of the village. - Tue Nov  3 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ...Pride.. - Tue Nov  3 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You'll really let pride put him into his grave?..The kid haven't live'd his life as yet... - Tue Nov  3 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'll let him make his own decisions. - Tue Nov  3 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I have no right to force him either way. - Tue Nov  3 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Ketsuki..You should remember he's a child. - Tue Nov  3 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Not an adult.. - Tue Nov  3 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He's also a Shinobi who is far stronger than myself... - Tue Nov  3 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And who has resolved to do what needs to be done, when he feels ready; which, admitably.. - Tue Nov  3 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Isn't anytime soon. - Tue Nov  3 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: This feels like something I've been through already. - Tue Nov  3 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That so, huh? - Tue Nov  3 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yes. - Tue Nov  3 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: The lad is dead now though..This house belong'd to him. - Tue Nov  3 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I didn't guide him and teach him how to make good decision.. - Tue Nov  3 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..I see. - Tue Nov  3 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: He had powerful techniques that can put anyone one.. - Tue Nov  3 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Takeda was Hana-Sensei's adopted son. - Tue Nov  3 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: down* - Tue Nov  3 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I had to talk him out of suicide after she commitied suicide herself. - Tue Nov  3 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I was there. - Tue Nov  3 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We're good freinds, but... yeah. - Tue Nov  3 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You wanna know how he died? - Tue Nov  3 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Picked a fight above his league? - Tue Nov  3 01:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly, as she clings to her lover as they move to the bedroom, enjoying being held as she holds her lover back, sighing happily.

"This will be my second time... I've been wanting this since the first..~" She teases her lover idly.* - Tue Nov  3 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slightly, smiling gently at her lover as she takes a pill; and pops one, before putting that on the bedside as she sits on the side of the bed- smiling gently at Ai.

"Mrm. I'm looking forward to just spending time with you tommorow even more- but.... It's night time anyway, may as well enjoy our second night together, right?" She says gently, shrugging off her coat.* - Tue Nov  3 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly, as she finishes stripping as well; leaving her in a pair of tight shorts and a slight top.. as she turns to roll onto her side and face her lover- giggling at the kittening.

"D'aww... that's adorable..~" She says cheerily.. as she leans forwards onto her hands.

"Nyahhh?~"* - Tue Nov  3 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) giggles as she rolls onto her back, letting herself be pinned by the pounce; blushing gently as she stares up at the woman nuzzling into her, arms sliding back around her.

"Ah, I see.. you're a naughty little kitty, aren't you, Nyahh?~" She teases, rubbing her back gently as she is latched too, nuzzling right back lovingly.* - Tue Nov  3 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blushes at the suggestion of applying some natural lube. Still; she grins at the other womans words as she rubs her back, nuzzling into her and smiling as she doesn't struggle at all.

"Aha... do whatever you think is right, love.. whatever you want to, uh huh..!"* - Tue Nov  3 04:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) yawns, walking sleepily out of Ai's house as she looks around, scratching her head as she quietly looks around.
