<br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and nods, shrugging.

"Maybe we'll live, maybe we'll die. Maybe we'll win, maybe they will. Regardless of how it goes.." She smiles as she leans back. "We'll have served our village, we'll have had a battle. I'll be happier once we're fighting.." She admits calmly. "Anyway, order the booze."* - Tue Nov 17 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) pours out the first two shots- sake, at first. She chuckles faintly.

"Yeah... I guess I am a bit upset about how that went... mostly because the fucks didn't stand and fight. Didn't even pause when I killed one of them- the other's just.. fled like cowards with Chikyu. It really.. really pissed me off seein that, I s'pose." She admits softly- frowning.

"That and not bein able to chase them down, but.. fuckers went underground, I think.." She murmurs- as she knocks back the first shot and looks to Ai, grining as she gulps it down.

"Ah, well... I'll be happier once we've cut the cowardly fucks to pieces."* - Tue Nov 17 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs and nods- as she pours the second pair of shots; straight whiskey in the small shot glasses.

"Eh. To reach her, I may kill a few. I won't be restraining my blows like in practice- and a flaming nodachi is a pretty brutal weapon when it comes down to it." She muses idly- as she reaches for her glass- holds it up for a toast.

"Anyway. To Sunagakure." She says calmly- before tipping back a second and sighing happily- feeling a pleasant buzz begin to take her.* - Tue Nov 17 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and nods- humming calmly as she enjoys the warmth filling her from the two shots- as she pours out two more of Sake- chuckling softly.

"Mrm... Glad to hear you've got a plan." She says warmly, as she leans back and sighs- lifting a glass of Sake and tipping it back with a gentle smile.* - Tue Nov 17 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly as she pours out another two shots of whisky.

"So, secure her with a scouting mission, then roll in and make 'em suffer. Sound's good to me." She says lazily, as she tips back the whiskey and sighs happily- feeling increasingly pleasantly warm; though her tolerance is suprisingly high.* - Tue Nov 17 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ...Anyway. We should stop while we're still sober.. - Tue Nov 17 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, as she pushes herself up to stand and looks at the waiter, passing him a tip.

"Welp, let's go get ready."* - Tue Nov 17 07:06:14 2015

These ninja bandits are by Kirigakure, you will have no problem spotting them with Mirai's Byakugan assisting you. I want this to be a swift massacre of their men. - Tue Nov 17 07:17:20 2015

"Jahvul. We got this. And Trill- follow Ai's orders to the letter. Don't forget that was part of it. We go in smooth, clean... and leave no one alive." She says with a lax grin, and her hands in her pockets.

"Let's go take care of some business." She states lazily- turning to look at Ai.

"Well, Fearless Leader. Lead the way, and give us your orders."* - Tue Nov 17 07:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... Ai, I don't think what's east of Konoha is them either... And besides, it's on the way. We have to go through the area to the east anyway... to get to the other. - Tue Nov 17 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hey the longer we take the longer i get to sstay out. - Tue Nov 17 07:32:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Either that individual bandit is a survivor from their group, or they are camped east of Konoha... - Tue Nov 17 07:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's probably it, then.. maybe someone else got to our targets before we did, and we just need to get out Chikyu. - Tue Nov 17 07:36:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Because this guy isn't going to just let us go in, grab her, and get out. We are, in fact, goign to have to fight- even if you do send in a clone to get her while we do so. - Tue Nov 17 07:53:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ugh.. - Tue Nov 17 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) tilts her head back and sighs.

"Yeah, yeah... Ugh, this is why I hate Ninjutsu. It sucks the fun out of combat."* - Tue Nov 17 07:59:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly, tucking her hands into her pockets.

"A thunderstorm, huh..?" She muses as she looks up- then looks towards Ai. "Right. So basically- we fall back to you if we're in over our head... and for now, we trust this paper-guard to protect us in the battle? A'right. So- we ready to head in, yeah?" She says with a faint smile.

"In essence- we have a fallback point, but we're still goin in, not just bombardin with Ninjutsu. Good... sorry if I came of the wrong way- Just.... yeah." She shrugs. "Well- on your order, let's head in."* - Tue Nov 17 08:05:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) heads on in, grinning wide as she draws her Katana-- and makes an advance.* - Tue Nov 17 08:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) is calmly walking up- humming cheerfully with her Katana drawn and resting in her hand as she does. She looks on at the scene before her as she approaches. She looks on at the scene- stepping forwards calmly- blade drawn as some of Ai's paper's flutter around the purple haired swordswoman.

"Ah! Howdy! You the fine gentleman who took care of our target for us?" She inquires with a lazy smile as she approaches, waving cheerfully with the hand not holding a weapon.

"Don't suppose we could just slide in, grab our freind, and slide out? You seem to have a grudge with the people we where here to kill, after all." She states with a relaxed smile- gesturing at all the dead bodies.* - Tue Nov 17 08:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lerixus(They.Call.Me.Wynn) says: We'll have tea and cookies! - Tue Nov 17 08:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) pauses and blinks at the mans response to their arrival-blinking a few times.

"...Pardon?" She says, coughing a few times as she lowers her sword slightly- caught completely offguard. While she doesn't actually drop her weapon- keeping it in hand- she does lower it from her initial stance.

"....I mean, sure dude. We came here expecting a bunch of bandits- who.." She looks around for a moment. "It looks like you already killed, so.... yo, names Mitsunara. You are?" She says in a polite- calm tone as she cracks her shouldrs and smiles- wondering if this mission will, maybe, have a peaceful resolution.* - Tue Nov 17 08:17:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ai, you're team leader. Seems this guy who killed all the bandits before we got here is offering us tea and cookies inside the shelter of the headquarters of the peopel we came to kill. - Tue Nov 17 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: My personal input says this seems legit, but it's your call. - Tue Nov 17 08:19:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Whatever you say. - Tue Nov 17 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) calmly steps back- shrugging apologetically to Lerixus and sighing as she slinks back to near Trill.

"Sorry about the caution, I s'pose!"* - Tue Nov 17 08:21:20 2015

She then moves forwards, flanking Ai.

"So, yeah. Tea and Cookies." She states with a lazy smile as she walks forwards- then she nods.

"So, you a'ready found the chick, yeah?" She states calmly- then she frowns as Ai says the rest will hang back, clenching her fists.* - Tue Nov 17 08:25:36 2015

"I'd love to, but the penalty for disobeying a superior's orders in Suna is death, 'cordin to the Kage when he sent us out- so it's on our fearless leader to make these decisions.

But because she doesn't care about safety, or logic- and just want's to actually be doing somthing, regardless of how safe it is.* - Tue Nov 17 09:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And I'm old fashioned, y'know? - Tue Nov 17 09:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Just eat guys. - Tue Nov 17 09:28:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and crosses her legs, sitting near the food and reaching for a cookie to munch on.

"Mrm. So, you're a very polite man, huh? Letting us have a last meal and some courtesy before we fight you, Mrm?" She says with a relaxed smile as she reaches for a cup of tea, and dips the cookie.

"I'm obliged. I look forwards to the battle after the meal. Inside, outside, or elsewhere?" She inquires with a calm smile as she then moves to take a drink from the tea she dunked her cookie in.

Much like Janice from accounting, Mitsunara gives no fucks.* - Tue Nov 17 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lerixus(They.Call.Me.Wynn) says: Let's go meet Lerixus in battle. - Tue Nov 17 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: About time... - Tue Nov 17 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) pushes herself up to stand, stretching out as she thinks about the situation.

"This'll be interesting... fighting a Raiton user in a rainstorm.." She muses softly, as she flicks her Katana to the side and heads outside.* - Tue Nov 17 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Okay Team! Let's go- All Together! KAMEN RIDER KICK! - Tue Nov 17 09:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces as the being turns out to just be a clone... then shrugs.

As lightning begins to lance around, she twists her Iron blade- throwing it towards the nearest concentration to absorb the blast instead of her, as yet more bolts dance around the area. She grimaces- glanced a few times by proximity, but never hit fully...

And by that act of agility and reaction- her sensory abilities allowing her to feel the lightning chakra attacking her- she is able to avoid most of the damage..

"...Seriously..? And it was just a clone..? Good grief.. we shoulda just attacked on sight.... why didn't you give that order instead of the 'go in alone order'.." She idly complains as she flows through- her body able to resist the glancing blows that come close despite her trick with the metal weaponry being used to soak up most of the attacks near her.

"'s some real bullshit.."* - Tue Nov 17 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Attack'd on sight.. - Tue Nov 17 09:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: And what if they were just an critizen or something that wanted to assist? Have you ever heard Hassan doing anything without collecting details? - Tue Nov 17 09:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And that logic is why I didn't, in fact, attack on sight- and waited for your call. Don't mistake me being grumpy after a clusterfuck with me actually proposing a plan of action. - Tue Nov 17 09:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) eventually, is left standing still- panting lightly as the storm comes to a close... as she walks over towards her blade- where it is grounding some energy still. She waits a few before tugging it free and sighs.

"...Or something, I dunno. Ugh.... that took forever, and accomplished nothing." She says with a sigh. "Unless you got some kind of intel while you where in there alone?" She inquires idly, as she stretches out- seemingly... having no real reaction to what just happened beyond annoyance- her basic self preservation instincts seeming a bit damaged, judging by her lack of fear here.* - Tue Nov 17 09:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Location. - Tue Nov 17 09:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Great. Where? - Tue Nov 17 09:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: We're camping. - Tue Nov 17 09:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs, frowning.

"So she wasn't captured by someone who wants ransom, but a sick fuck... nice for her." She says- shrugging. "Anyway. I suggest we base out in the house while we search- we can't really go home until we've succeded, and we haven't failed until we're all dead." She says calmly- as if she has no emotional attachment to any of that.

"Anyway.... so. Who here likes campfires?'* - Tue Nov 17 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And songs 'n shit. - Tue Nov 17 09:56:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah? - Tue Nov 17 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'll need to make a few plans.. - Tue Nov 17 09:58:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... I say this because uh.. - Tue Nov 17 10:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I don't know how to camp. - Tue Nov 17 10:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: It's 'protected'. - Tue Nov 17 10:00:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shifts to lean against the wall, yawning as she pulls something out from her supplies in the robe- a scroll.

"So, Ai.... She's being tortured in some forest, huh..? This is gonna be.. interesting." She muses idly- as she leans against the wall- reading up on the most advanced Jutsu she's bothered to study to date; a Lightning Clone.

She doesn't look up, as she speaks. "Andd she's off. So, Trill, Mirai. How about we get to know each other better. Or.. something?" She suggests calmly.* - Tue Nov 17 10:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Talking. - Tue Nov 17 10:04:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles at his comment without looking up from the scroll- reading through the idea of vibrating her chakra in a bunshin to generate a lightning bunshin through static energy in the chakra- or something along those lines.

"Yeah? I see. Whatcha wanna talk about?" She inquires in an idle drawl as the storm clouds slowly clear above- humming as she reads... before looking up as Ai speaks.

"Eh? We got company?"* - Tue Nov 17 10:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: I need a cigar.. - Tue Nov 17 10:08:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You don't want to prepare for the bullshit ahead of us? - Tue Nov 17 10:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Seriously, when you talk in that kinda tone, and just sorta... run on at the end? It sounds wayy fuckin ominous. - Tue Nov 17 10:08:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: And this I shall be a stain. - Tue Nov 17 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly, and shrugs.

"I'm here, 'cus it was my fuckup that got Chikyu caught.... after all, I was with her. Even if I had no way of stopping what happened that I can think of... if I'd been stronger, she'd never have been kidnapped, and that pack of bandits who took her would be dead by now." She says- shrugging as she leans back to look back to the scroll she was reading- re-immersing herself in it's parchment.

"He's right, y'know. Even if no one here but you cares about your prison sentence, Trill, we won't fail. Even though I don't care what becomes of you, even a little, Trill. I'll ensure you live through this, and the mission succedes. Y'know why? Because it's do or die, on a mission like this. We'll only fail if we die." She says calmly- chuckling as she reads while talking.

"So, let's talk about something cheerful, instead, shall we?"* - Tue Nov 17 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Eh.. - Tue Nov 17 10:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Wow youd think people would care even a little about the current kages grandson but nice to know that  Mitsunara. - Tue Nov 17 10:14:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And in case you think it's some kind of grudge- understand. - Tue Nov 17 10:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's nothing personal. - Tue Nov 17 10:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I don't really care about much at all, beyond getting my jobs done, and enjoying life while I can. - Tue Nov 17 10:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) hums calmly as she keeps reading while idly interjecting into the conversation- enjoying her back and forth between herself and Trill, as she lounges against the wall.... and reads the scroll she pulled out with a faint interest.

As she reads it- she opines out a line at the end of her most recent exchange.

"I guess you could call me heartless..." She murmurs softly- a note of sadness entering her voice at the admission. "... Not by choice, but it's definitly true." She murmurs softly as she reads.* - Tue Nov 17 10:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) hums calmly as she continues to read her scroll- speaking offhand as she tries to comprehend the theory of making the Bunshin physical with said Raiton chakra.

"Mrm... beautiful creature, that Liger. Summoning contract or puppet?" She inquires idly- as she idly practices vibrating her chakra to convert it's nature- something she is at least minimally capable of due to affinity...* - Tue Nov 17 10:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Its on of my many summons. - Tue Nov 17 10:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow at that, as she finishes the last few paragraphs and wraps up the scroll- storing away the theory inside her head.

"I see. Many, huh? Specialist?"* - Tue Nov 17 10:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ...? - Tue Nov 17 10:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Huh Oh no not really Its just like a special skill i was born with. - Tue Nov 17 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: It comes from my mothers side of the family. - Tue Nov 17 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Kekkai Gekkai that lets you summon a shit ton of stuff? Cool. - Tue Nov 17 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Yeah. - Tue Nov 17 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Other than that im like everyone elese in my family we command the elemnts . - Tue Nov 17 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Wind and Fire are the most common nature is my famaily. - Tue Nov 17 10:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: So imangine how bummed I was when i found out I couldnt use either of them. - Tue Nov 17 10:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly as she resumes one of her practices from earlier today- drawing a sword, and immolating it... she grins as she stares at the flames- nodding.

"Flame, huh..? Yeah, I've seen that one a lot. And your Grandpa is a g'damn monster with Wind." She muses aloud. "But you- from earlier... Earth and Lightning, right?" She says calmly- humming as she holds the fire steady as long as she can- staring at the flame as she pours her chakra into it..* - Tue Nov 17 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs at that, as she continues to focus primarily on maintaining the flames on her weapon- wanting to at least push her boundaries with the Jutsu slightly today before retiring to rest and train something else; her work ethic apparently something else entirely.

Then again, work is all that fills her empty heart and bleak soul.

"I wouldn't say you're the weakest. Least likely to fit in? Definitly. But.... being abnormal doesn't make you weak. It makes you unpredictable." She advises calmly- as she holds the fire to the steel while moving through Kata's, humming calmly.* - Tue Nov 17 10:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh... I wonder. - Tue Nov 17 10:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ai. - Tue Nov 17 10:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Bryson ever tell you anything about me? - Tue Nov 17 10:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Uh? No..? - Tue Nov 17 10:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles calmly as she holds the fire in place, waiting for a response from Ai- curious as to how the man will respond to her question- as she looks towards Trilliam.

"And yeah, this is a Katon Chakra flow.. I learned it the other night from Izanami.." She explains- before chuckling at Ai's response.

"And I see... sorry- don't worry about it, Fearless Leader. I just.. expected otherwise. Bryson rather strongly dislikes me, see.." She murmurs- as she begins to speed up her motions with the flame, flowing gently through steps.* - Tue Nov 17 10:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Then I know why. - Tue Nov 17 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Same as Su I'll assume.. - Tue Nov 17 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ...Heh. - Tue Nov 17 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Bit different flavor, but same family group, is one way to put it. - Tue Nov 17 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Meh...Su was a great friend to me.. - Tue Nov 17 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah..? - Tue Nov 17 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Indeed.. - Tue Nov 17 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I've not heard much about them, other than that they where another Necro. - Tue Nov 17 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, that and how proud Bryson sounded when he recounted how Su died. Heh.. - Tue Nov 17 10:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: He got himself killed.. - Tue Nov 17 10:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Then again- he was making his big speech to threaten me into submission. - Tue Nov 17 10:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles faintly as she leans against the wall.

"Although, I'll admit. My practice of the dark art's is.. pretty different from what I've heard of Su." She admits calmly- as she focuses intently... before attempting the technique from the scroll she read- vibrating her chakra into raiton energy, which she then shapes into a Bunshin.

It's a decent first attempt at actually using the technique- as she forms a staticly distorted version of herself that grins at her. She grins and salutes back- then chuckles softly as she dismisses it and heaves a breath... leaning back.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs at the statement as she focuses her internal energy again before forcing it back out into another clone- this one's outline perhaps slightly less distorted and chaotic, at least. She hums softly as she responds to Ai.

"Maybe... the scroll mentioned that they electrocute what they detonate on, so there is that.. on the other hand, my Chakra Control isn't the best these days.." She muses aloud- chuckling softly. "And I've not the time to invest properly in elemental training." She admits softly.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: We're scouting. - Tue Nov 17 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs and nods- stretching out as she forms the seals for a Clone.... as the clone takes the Mundane Iron Sword she was carrying, and then salutes it's original with a lazy smile. She leans back to begin to rest up- then looks towards Ai.

"So. Deploy the clones, huh..? A'right.. but mine's gonna be a lot weaker, and we both know this. I'm a physical specialist- mine is pretty.... well, it's gonna be... Ugh." She just shrugs as the clone starts to stroll forwards.* - Tue Nov 17 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Right... just a warning. - Tue Nov 17 21:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: It's for scouting. - Tue Nov 17 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Just lettin you know. - Tue Nov 17 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Once it has been destroyed, you'll gain the info from it's short life span. - Tue Nov 17 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Yup I use them to train alot. - Tue Nov 17 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) calmly walks up, Iron Katana in hand as she stalks forwards at the head of their group- eyes roving the area almost lazily as she does.

Sadly, she lacks any stealth skills- as she does, however, approach the scene. The question of how a wall was erected in the middle of a forest is worth asking- and it drifts through the womans eyes.

She has no visible emotional reaction to this scene before her- actually sneering.

"So. Just a depraved lunatic, huh..? Hold tight, Chikyu... he won't be alive much longer." She states idly- as she advances with a blade in hand- smiling lazily as she starts to advance- cautiously eyeing the area.* - Tue Nov 17 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces as she charges in.

Meanwhile, the real Mitsunari is approaching the scene from a short while away- strolling up with her hands in her pockets from a good distance...

As, meanwhile, the clone on the frontlines... stares at the explosion of lightning... and begins to charge forwards just as the first stream is dying down- readying herself for something as she stares at all that lightning rushing from her foe.

She has no real idea of what to do here- but she has a pretty decent plan. Her sword is held steady and ahead- readied for something, though what isn't clear as the Bunshin runs forwards-eyes fixed on him as it draws near....

But for some reason, not quite reaching melee just yet.* - Tue Nov 17 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) flows. This attack isn't what she was planning for- not at all. But at the same time, she has an attack just for this kind of incredibly rapid attacks. The clone's chakra flows- and it's blade becomes a blurring crescent for a moment; seeming to rip through the air.

The left handed Katana swings in that lurring crescent to slice through the arm coming to punch her. It's a quick, chakra fueled slice designed just for situations like this- when she see's an attack coming, but couldn't usually move fast enough to do anything about it.

Meanwhile, her right arm is lunging low to try and make any kind of physical contact possible with his body.* - Tue Nov 17 22:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) keeps moving as her blade severs the mans arm, then twists it as the real one walks up. She smiles as her technique seems to be more effective than she expected- as it brings the Katana through the mans neck while he's held still, moving to sever it in a secondary crescent after the first.

"This is over.... quick and efficient. Thanks, Ai." She says warmly- as the clone's blade moves to sever the mans neck if no one stops her.* - Tue Nov 17 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Besides, he probably uses a Cyanide Capsule, just like his men do. - Tue Nov 17 22:33:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's Sanoke's technique. - Tue Nov 17 22:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as she walks up- dispelling the clone and reclaiming her sword. She moves to shoulder Chikyu's unconscious form with a grumble.

"Damn bastard.. killing himself before I can behead him, how dare he!" She spits- actively enraged with his suicide despite her own intent to kill him, for some reason- a hateful gleam in his eyes.

"I hate cowards like that..."* - Tue Nov 17 22:44:03 2015

"Mrm.... Well... that went well... apart from.." She sighs as she closes her eyes and thinks. "...Tch.."* - Tue Nov 17 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) calmly follows.

"Hey, Ai. How about we finish what we started 'for we headed out?"* - Tue Nov 17 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hm? Sure. - Tue Nov 17 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks on in, waves to the bartender and grins as she pulls out the two bottles they bought last night, but never finished.

"Two glasses, hoss." She says calmly to the bartender- before looking back to Ai. "Ugh... well, that went smooth."* - Tue Nov 17 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs at that, leaning back with a quiet frown.

"I'm sure you do. It was all good tactics- it just wasn't... fun." She says softly- as she pours out the first two shots, sets the bottle down- and knocks one back.

"Not like fights usually are for me. Ugh... and then he just went and pussed out like a bitch rather 'n facin his death like a man, too..." She notes in idle disgust- before shrugging as she leans against her chair.

"Ah, well.."* - Tue Nov 17 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and shrugs as she follows up the first round of whiskey, with a round of Sake- filling out the two shot glasses and shrugging.

"Eh... I suppose I woulda, but.. I dunno if I'da cared." She muses idly- before chuckling. "A worthy battle, after all... Ah, anyway. So- how are you feelin?" She inquires with a broad smile as she knocks back the Sake- and leans back, smiling peacefully.* - Tue Nov 17 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and shrugs as she pours out two more of Whiskey- humming calmly as she knocks hers back. She's a little more steady with her booze-habit; her contitution slows things down, but that just leaves it all so very.. gradual, as she lounges back and smiles.

"I would, if I where you. I dont' see any reason not to, after all.."* - Tue Nov 17 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles throatily as she pours out two more of whiskey. This session combined with their earlier session, has left the two bottles about half empty by this point. She crooks an eyebrow up at Ai and chuckles.

"Don't ask about the reasons, huh..? Why wouldn't he want someone 's strong as you taking A Chuunin exam, huh?" She says teasingly as she knocks back the most recent shot.* - Tue Nov 17 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) laughs at this display- chuckling as she shakes her head. Her own cheeks are cherry red, as she simply handles her booze much like a normal person.

"Guess we're finishing these another time, huh?" She teases idly as she looks over at Ai.

"You need a hand gettin home, or you gonna be okay?"* - Tue Nov 17 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks over and calmly picks the man up in a bridal carry- sighing faintly and smiling gently as she does.

"I have no idea where you live.." She realizes aloud as she lifts the woman up to her own chest level, thoughtfully pausing.

"..Huh."* - Tue Nov 17 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stares at the bishounen held in her arms, cradling the smaller figure somewhat like you might a child- despite the other being a grown man. She herself is just that big and overly muscular, it must be admited.

"....This is going to be a /fun/ trip.." She grumbles as she heads outside..* - Wed Nov 18 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks up carrying an absolutely wasted Ai.

"Does anyone know where she lives? Cus I don't."* - Wed Nov 18 00:00:51 2015
