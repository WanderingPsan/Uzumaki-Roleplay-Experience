<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah.. well, I was already planning on purchasing myslef a more mundane sword- so I suppose I'd say Silver, as that seems more likely to be of use against more unusual foes and styles, sir. - Fri Oct 30 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Or not I guess... - Fri Oct 30 03:58:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: I was going to buy a sword for her but...oh well... - Fri Oct 30 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) seems to be lightly embarassed at being made such an offer by the Hokage, but smiles gently as she bows respectfully in response regardless; knowing better than to insult him by saying 'no', and quite interested regardless.* - Fri Oct 30 03:59:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Maybe I should focus more on my Genjutsu and Ninjutsu.. - Fri Oct 30 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I don't mind. - Fri Oct 30 04:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: If you have any group tasks, I wouldn't mind accompanying him to see how he performs on a first mission for Konoha, to give you an appraisal? - Fri Oct 30 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: That's fine. - Fri Oct 30 04:21:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. I'll be glad to work with you, Kyu. Names Ketsuki. - Fri Oct 30 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So it's an Escort? Who are we escorting. - Fri Oct 30 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: --- That and.. where do we find the client? - Fri Oct 30 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: He'll be at the gate. - Fri Oct 30 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: An architect. - Fri Oct 30 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: By the name of Zane. - Fri Oct 30 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: A'right. Kyu, ready to head out, or need to gather some supplies first? - Fri Oct 30 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) cracks her knuckles and grins at her partner for this mission, a relaxed smile on her face as she salutes the Kage, then turns to face him.

"I'm pretty much ready to go, but I'm willing to wait if you need to prepare."* - Fri Oct 30 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Also if you see Toudou. - Fri Oct 30 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Apprehend him. - Fri Oct 30 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah..? Very well, sir. If you want, I'll send him a letter telling him I wanna meet him at the Konoha training field. We got on pretty well on our trip together; and he might actually show up there. It'd be a nice trap. - Fri Oct 30 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Very well. If that will be all, then.. let's head to the gates and pick up our architect, Kyu. - Fri Oct 30 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks out to the gate- stretching out and  yawning as she looks around; then smiling faintly at the business suit wearing man they've come to escort- waving at the well dressed older gentleman. He turns to face them, and Ketsuki bows.

"Ah. My bodyguards for the trip to Amegakure, I presume?"

"Hai, yes Zane-San. I and Kyu here will be your escorts on this trip." She replies calmly, before he responds smoothly.

"I see... just two genin..? Very well... I hope you two know what you're doing, at least." The man responds- to a faint smile from Ketsuki.

"Of course, Sir. We would not be entrusted with this mission, where we not capable. Let's get you headed to Amegakure, then." She suggests- starting to walk to the south, turning to look at Kyu. "Shall we?"* - Fri Oct 30 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kamigami, Kyu(Jetray78) says: We shall. - Fri Oct 30 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) hums as they walk along the road, turning to look at Kyu as they walk- one of them to either side of their client as they escort him along the road cheerfully humming.

"So, Kyu. Why Konoha, if you don't mind me asking? What made you choose to come to this village in particular, that is?" She inquires cheerfully as they walk along- their client, Zane, simply reading a small book as they walk.* - Fri Oct 30 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah. Like the forests and stuff, I guess- or do you mean the people? - Fri Oct 30 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kamigami, Kyu(Jetray78) says: The forest. - Fri Oct 30 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm, I see. - Fri Oct 30 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as they come to a bridge- looking around as their client pauses upon realizing she's stopped. She squints at it momentarily, scratching her head.

"A bridge... man, bridges always give me a bad feeling.." She muses- as golden bronze and red leaves float through the air from the countless trees nearby. A sigh escapes her as she begins to walk across it, and Zane resumes moving as well.

"So, you like the trees, so you chose this village? Odd way to choose where to live, but if it makes you happy, man."* - Fri Oct 30 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stretches out and yawns as they walk along the road.

"Mrm.. so we're getting near where Amegakure is meant to be, yeah?" She muses as she looks to Zane- who simply nods.

"Correct, yes. This has been a most peaceful journey, I'm suprised.." The client muses- to which Ketsuki simply chuckles and shrugs.* - Fri Oct 30 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) yawns as they reach the small settlement on the outskirts of Amegakure- and looks to Kyu, then Zane.

"Regardless- it seems we've reached our destination." She muses- chuckling softly. "Welcome to Amegakure, Zane-Sir." She says simply- bowing to the client who simply nods and scurries of- before she turns to Kyu and yawns.

"So, shall we get some rest before we head home to Konoha to report the mission?"* - Fri Oct 30 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) laughs softly at that, as she crosses her legs to sit down and catch some brief rest, nodding.

"Right. We'll rest a while, then head back."* - Fri Oct 30 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. - Fri Oct 30 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ready to head back yet? - Fri Oct 30 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kamigami, Kyu(Jetray78) says: Yes - Fri Oct 30 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Right.. let's head back, then. - Fri Oct 30 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grunts as she pushes herself up to stand- yawning and stretching out as she does before turning to head back the way they came.

"Let's move on out."* - Fri Oct 30 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) hums as they walk through the trees on the way back, smiling as the road goes on into the bridge, hands tucked into her pockets as they travel along.

"Mrm.... this sure was a simple mission."* - Fri Oct 30 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) shrugs at that- yawning.

"Anyway.. it'll be good to have another mission on my record, Mhrm." She says warmly, smiling with one hand at her side loose, and another on her Tanto's hilt.

"So! Your first mission with Konoha- nice and simple, huh?"* - Fri Oct 30 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Quiet type, Huh? - Fri Oct 30 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Anyway, we're done. May as well report to the Hokage. - Fri Oct 30 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm.. - Fri Oct 30 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Let's look around for him. If he's not here, we can just go to bed and turn this in tommorow.. - Fri Oct 30 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hey, Takeda. - Fri Oct 30 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hello. - Fri Oct 30 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: YOu know where the Hokage is? We're back to turn in that mission. - Fri Oct 30 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: No. - Fri Oct 30 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: He probably went to sleep or something. - Fri Oct 30 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah.. fair enough. - Fri Oct 30 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: In that case.. - Fri Oct 30 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It was nice meeting you and working with you, Kyu-san. - Fri Oct 30 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'll be headed to sleep now. - Fri Oct 30 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Bye Ketsuki. - Fri Oct 30 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) yoloswags off into the night.* - Fri Oct 30 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Mmm... - Sat Oct 31 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: What.. exactly is going on here? - Sat Oct 31 01:20:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Nothing much. - Sat Oct 31 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: A'right then, Takeda. You know where the Hokage is, then? - Sat Oct 31 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: No. - Sat Oct 31 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I still have to turn in that escort mission from yesterda- damnit. - Sat Oct 31 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Sat Oct 31 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Wait. - Sat Oct 31 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Fuck. - Sat Oct 31 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nani? - Sat Oct 31 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It's been a long day for the both of us. - Sat Oct 31 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, stretching out as she shifts to lean against a tree, thinking.

"Mrm, yeah.."* - Sat Oct 31 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Sorry, Had to check something. - Sat Oct 31 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You were on a mission? - Sat Oct 31 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, got back from it last night. - Sat Oct 31 01:23:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: We can't do anything. - Sat Oct 31 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: A'right then... I'm headed out to the training field, I think. - Sat Oct 31 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Sat Oct 31 01:27:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) turns to walk off, yawning and stretching out.* - Sat Oct 31 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hey, Takeda. - Sat Oct 31 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Do you know how to use Raiton? - Sat Oct 31 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I do. - Sat Oct 31 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I see... it's an element I've been planning to get into. I don't suppose you'd be willing to give me some tips, or somethin? - Sat Oct 31 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Sat Oct 31 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, what? - Sat Oct 31 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Sorry say again. - Sat Oct 31 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'm asking if you'd be willing to give me any tips or hints on how to use Raiton, or how to get started at least. - Sat Oct 31 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm...Raiton... - Sat Oct 31 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh right, yeah sorry. - Sat Oct 31 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Um. - Sat Oct 31 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Just vibrate your chakra. - Sat Oct 31 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Vibrate my Chakra? - Sat Oct 31 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah, you know. - Sat Oct 31 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Vibrate it as much as you possibly can. - Sat Oct 31 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: O.. kay. - Sat Oct 31 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I mean, That's how you do it. - Sat Oct 31 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You simply build your charka up within your body, then vibrate it as much as you possibly can. - Sat Oct 31 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Watch. - Sat Oct 31 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Impressive. - Sat Oct 31 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) frowns at this, not understanding how she's supposed to make her chakra vibrate; though she's been working on her chakra control, it's certainly not that good yet. Still- she bows her head as she speaks; watching his example as she sits down and crosses her legs into a meditive position, thinking quietly.

"So... vibrate it. And that... is part of Raiton?" She says- blinking as she tilts her head to the side- reaching slowly for her chakra pool. She takes a deep breath, as she reaches into herself and focuses on that chakra within herself.

She feels for it- and without direction, merely attempts to stimulate and manipulate it, to no outward effect.

"I don't get it." She admits softly.* - Sat Oct 31 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You probably need practice. - Sat Oct 31 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Look. - Sat Oct 31 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: No, I mean.. - Sat Oct 31 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I don't understand why. - Sat Oct 31 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: What does vibration have to do with anything? - Sat Oct 31 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Because thats how you apply the change in nature to your chakra. - Sat Oct 31 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Right, but.. - Sat Oct 31 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Why does it work like that? - Sat Oct 31 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Because thats what lightning is, vibrations. - Sat Oct 31 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Your chakra is the medium. - Sat Oct 31 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Think of it as a source of energy. - Sat Oct 31 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Makes sense. - Sat Oct 31 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Right... Okay. - Sat Oct 31 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I guess that.. kinda makes sense. - Sat Oct 31 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: By vibrating it, you are giving it more energy...kinda. - Sat Oct 31 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slowly at the explanation, stroking her chin as she ceases her initial meditations to consider what her fellow Shinobi is saying; before nodding.

"Right. I get it, yeah." She says softly. "You induce vibrations in your chakra, to make that chakra lightning, before directing it." She says- nodding slowly. She takes a deep breath and sighs, as she clasps her hands together and takes a breath; before forming a ram seal simply to focus her chakra, without using an actual Jutsu.

She breathes in, trying to shift it to her hands before inducing vibrations with her will. She breathes in- then breathes out... and winces, as she feels a slight tinge of static electricity; akin to a shock from touching metal after dragging your feet.

"Ahh.. okay, I see.." She murmurs- before looking to Takeda and smiling, as she ceases and slides out of that posture.

"Thanks- I'll practice on my own later, but that really helped. I had no idea where to start, man. Mrm... anyway." She looks between Takeda and Ziare. "You two didn't just come out here to help me- let's think of a group training exercise, yeah?"* - Sat Oct 31 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I don't do elemental jutsu... - Sat Oct 31 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah? Well.. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Neither do I, yet. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: How about you and me spar? - Sat Oct 31 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll spar you. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I specialize in support. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. Kenjutsu. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Though I.. don't have much of a good weapon, admitably. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Uhm, can I borrow a kunai? - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) tosses the man a Kunai, chuckling; as she herself.. pulls a not-much-larger Tanto.

"Sure."* - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So.. - Sat Oct 31 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You ready to start? - Sat Oct 31 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah... - Sat Oct 31 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly- then stretches out as she looks at him with a thoughtful eye.

"Alright then." She says simply- as he declares his readiness to start.. she tenses against the ground; before jumping up while performing a single handseal; a tiger seal. Her hands contort- and then she is launched forwards, her metabolic rate increasing, even as she is launched at him in the chakra enhanced leap.

It's no true combination attack; and it's clear she still needs the handseals.. but her mastery of Shunshin seems to have come a long way since she learned the Jutsu...!

As suddenly, to the cry of "DYNAMICCC ENTRORU!", she is not a good distance away from him; but her foot is rather flying toward his jaw from a suprisingly close distance.* - Sat Oct 31 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) meanwhile, drops back from the kick to the ground, swaying back and forth as she snaps back into a stance after hitting the ground and pushing herself back onto her feet, grinning slightly- as she says in a cheerful tone.

"Always wanted to do that, just to see if I could." She says with a faint grin, as she sways- somewhat dizzy; though getting used to it more and more with every body flicker.

She then spends this moment simply pulling her Tanto out and recovering- thankfully, giving her foe an equal kind of opportunity.* - Sat Oct 31 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) finishes steadying herself, then notices he's thrown his weapon.. and blinks a few times. She cracks her shoulders, then; steadying herself as she speaks out and shifts the Tanto into a backwards grip; edge facing her, blunt side facing her foe.

"You alright, man..?" She inquires calmly, as she finishes steadying herself from the disoriented state she was in before; taking a few cautious steps closer, blade raised and stance low.* - Sat Oct 31 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares on- eyes widening at the attack. Her grin fades as she realizes she's paralyzed, and begins to strain against it with suprising amounts of resistance; then laughing.

"Not.. bad, damn.." She muses as she's immobilized. "Certainly.. unexpected." She admits softly- as she tries to move forwards, to the sides- in any direction at all, straining against the pinning force that can't quite be placed, due to the Kunai in her shadow.* - Sat Oct 31 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles at this.. as she sighs and begins to struggle. She's moved an inch- but still... certainly, not enough to break free of his Jutsu.

"Tch... not a bad trick, that jutsu... still, it won't work on me in the future... not bad, however. Definitly a good one- hard to deal with the first time, yeah." She says- nodding slightly as he holds the Kunai to her neck.

"You win, I s'pose..."* - Sat Oct 31 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sure, keep it. I've got plenty. - Sat Oct 31 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Thanks. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But yeah, I mainly excell in support. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I think up strategies. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And I assist my allies. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. I didn't really use my usual opening move there, or things mighta gone different; I wanted to restrict myself to physical combat to make this fun. But that Shadow Jutsu- pretty good. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Thanks. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: So you must be really strong. - Sat Oct 31 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You run missions on your own and all. - Sat Oct 31 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Sat Oct 31 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at that, shrugging.

"Eh... the one I need to turn in would be my.. third, C Rank- but I've yet to end up in a real fight on one of my missions, and my most recent mission I wasn't alone; I had a partner for it." She explains calmly as she sits down, crossing her legs and stretching as she begins to meditate, intent on recuperating from the fight.

"I'm nothing special, really."* - Sat Oct 31 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm... - Sat Oct 31 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Mrm. - Sat Oct 31 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hm? - Sat Oct 31 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'll be meditating on my Raiton affinity for a while, dude. - Sat Oct 31 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Feel free to do whatever; no need to keep me company. - Sat Oct 31 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Right, I should get going. - Sat Oct 31 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Ketsuki. - Sat Oct 31 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah? - Sat Oct 31 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Come over here a sec. - Sat Oct 31 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) looks up slowly from her after-battle meditations, smiling gently. She had been focusing on the chakra-vibration techniques that Takeda had introduced her too- but she simply nods her head as she speaks, rising from her meditation to approach him.

"Aye?"* - Sat Oct 31 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks at that, suprised- but then smiling gently. She understands, on an empathic level, that Takeda just needs comfort, a freind- and while she doesn't see him at all romantically, he's almost like family to her at this point; the one she had to rely on while they where alone in this village for a few weeks.

She squeezes him back, hugging him slightly.

"...You okay?"* - Sat Oct 31 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) rubs his back for him, gently holding him; as she speaks firmly.

"Yeah. And you're my freind, Takeda... and don't you dare leave me anytime soon, got it baka? If you die on me, I will hire a necromancer to bring you back, just to beat you up for dying, got it?"* - Sat Oct 31 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks at that.... and frowns solemnly.

"...I see. You're taking the Chuunin exam, or the Gezo private exam.... Either way.." She sighs. "A risk, but one you'll have to take I guess.... I can only wish you the best of luck... and.." She trails of, taking a deep breatha nd closing her eyes.

"..I swear it- I'll make sure your will is followed, if it comes to it."* - Sat Oct 31 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slowly, thinking about what he just told her.

"I see. I trust you have reasons, and that they are good- and with that in mind, I can only wish you the best.. and make you fucking /promise/ not to fail."* - Sat Oct 31 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) looks into his eyes... and nods as much as she can in their current position, which isn't much.

"...Alright then. Not a soul, Takeda."* - Sat Oct 31 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) frowns at this.. and then sighs wearily.

"...Why?" She says- a note of earnest pain in her tone. "He's the only Kage we have- the strongest Shinobi here. What, does he just not believe in Konoha..? Or just not care..?"* - Sat Oct 31 03:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...So you're taking the exams to be qualifiable as a legal Kage in his absence. - Sat Oct 31 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yes... - Sat Oct 31 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm becoming the Hokage in a few weeks...permanently. - Sat Oct 31 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: And because of that...i'm being forced to take this exam... - Sat Oct 31 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..I.. see. - Sat Oct 31 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .....I can only hope you are ready, Takeda. - Sat Oct 31 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't know if I am...Zeus says I am but...I don't know if I can pass the exam. - Sat Oct 31 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I have to fight ten others in a battle to the death...ten versus one... - Sat Oct 31 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ten people..? - Sat Oct 31 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: At once..? - Sat Oct 31 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: God... - Sat Oct 31 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yes... - Sat Oct 31 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Well, at least your Ninjutsu speciality is very well suited to multiple foes, yeah..? - Sat Oct 31 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah but...ten people... - Sat Oct 31 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: What kind of an exam is that?! - Sat Oct 31 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I think Zeus is overestimating me...i'm not even a Chuunin yet... - Sat Oct 31 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... If you die, I blame Zeus... but more than him, the Gezo. - Sat Oct 31 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Not that the Gezo care. - Sat Oct 31 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: To them we're just puppets. - Sat Oct 31 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Tch... - Sat Oct 31 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I doubt they care what happens to Konoha when they remove our Hokage. - Sat Oct 31 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I have to do this though...I have to. - Sat Oct 31 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Mhrm. Anyway.. - Sat Oct 31 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Sat Oct 31 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Enough about that. - Sat Oct 31 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) cracks her shoulders, letting go of comforting Takeda to stand up and look at Mamoru, crooking an eyebrow as she looks at him.

"Sup, what brings you here?"* - Sat Oct 31 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: I need to stop coming here, this is the third stranger...today... - Sat Oct 31 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I'm from Kumogakure no Sato. - Sat Oct 31 03:30:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: He isn't around right now. - Sat Oct 31 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I see. - Sat Oct 31 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Unfortunate. - Sat Oct 31 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: What do you need to speak to him about? - Sat Oct 31 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Could you please relay him a message? - Sat Oct 31 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: ---Ah. - Sat Oct 31 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He's.. busy. What do you need? - Sat Oct 31 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I wanted to speak to him. - Sat Oct 31 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: About dealing with Edge. - Sat Oct 31 03:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I am a Chuunin from Kumogakure no Sato. - Sat Oct 31 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah... so there where more Survivors than just your Kage. - Sat Oct 31 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'm sure she'll be glad to know that.. - Sat Oct 31 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: ---My Lord Raikage is alive? - Sat Oct 31 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: She is. - Sat Oct 31 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I am glad that Miss Yondaime survived. - Sat Oct 31 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles gently, looking on at Mamoru as she cracks her shoulders- then nods.

"Yeah... not sure where she is now. I informed her of a rumor I'd heard, that Edge was planning to attack Sunagakure next- she might be headed there, or she might be hiding somewhere in Konoha, training." She explains calmly.* - Sat Oct 31 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I see. - Sat Oct 31 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I will find Miss Raikage then. - Sat Oct 31 03:33:20 2015

"The hell is that supposed to mean?! Fighting women isn't right..? I suppose you also think that a woman fighting isn't right, then..?!" She trails of- steam coming out her ears, almost, in a comical caricature of rage as she starts to stalk forth.

"I see, I see. So you're just trying to be a gentleman, huh?" She says- narrowing her eyes... "Well, you shouldn't worry like that- that's a silly thing to put in a code of honor, when female Shinobi are often prety damn strong too, you know!" She says warningly.

"I mean, your own Kage is a woman! What would you do if a female Shinobi attacked you, huh?! Not defend yourself, cus of some code of honor?"* - Sat Oct 31 03:46:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) leans back and chuckles- smiling gently.

"I'd welcome a sparring match. I'm always looking to get stronger- and the only way to do that, is to train as hard as I can... so with that in mind.. I wouldn't expect you to hold back- even if you are a Chuunin who is probably loads stronger than me, alright?" She says happily- smiling softly.

"You said you have a spare Katana? I don't suppose you have Bokken we could use instead? If not, I'd implore you to allow me to use the spare- so that I'm not trying to fight a real sword user with a Tanto." She says- bowing her head respectfully, her fury seeming to have faded away in the face of him ceding to her request; as she rises from the bow to smile gently.

"Regardless. Even if you are far better than me- I have to test myself. That's just the kind of person I am."* - Sat Oct 31 03:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods at that- taking the blade and taking a close look at it, as she makes sure to carefully slide the sheathe into her belt, showing caution; an obvious degree of respect for the lethal weapon in her hand.

"..Hai. Thank you- I'll be sure to return this weapon to you after this spar and.." She squints, as she notices what he just said..

"A reverse bladed sword, huh..? I guess you must really be against killing, then.. interesting." She muses idly- as she takes a deep breath in... and then does two things, very rapidly.

She forms a single handseal; her hands breaking away from it almost as soon as it's formed... and reaches for her new sword, starting to draw it as her image flickers; and she's gone for a moment.. 

As she snaps out of the body flicker a short distance behind him; slightly dizzy, but not so bad as she was just a few days ago from the technique; just having finished drawing hte sword as she settles in a short while behind him, tensing against the ground.

She needs a moment to steady herself; but she's hoping to have caused a moment of uncertainty after dissapearing from view, in which she can strike; the blade already held in a balanced stance, and in the process of being lifted to strike. She's silent- not speaking to give away her position, or leting out a battle cry...

Just focused.* - Sat Oct 31 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks at this- clearly suprised by his turning to face her as she near teleports, and cursing her lesser mastery of the technique meaning she not only still requires a seal to perform it, but cannot strike in the same movement as using it. She sighs and bows her head.

"I'm suprised. Damn, usually that would catch someone offguard- your senses are finely honed." She admits- bowing her head in respect.. before shifting. She stares at him as he speaks- and nods.

"Alright then. I guess that was a waste of time, but I was hoping it would get me /somewhere/.." She admits ruefully... before stepping forwards. She twists the blade downwards to his shoulder as she steps two steps forwards; one step, blade is raised.

Second step, it begins to fall. Twist to push her body forwards behind the blade,  and to the side to minimize her profile. The blade falls towards his shoulder; but she is holding it backwards to avoid a risk of cutting him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) gasps as the man parries her blow without effort visible, staggering back from the simple quick, affirmative movement to stop her blade. She sways back- barely gripping onto the blade through simple determination as she plants her feet.

"Wha-"

Is all she has time to begin to say; before his blades hilt smashes into her stomach, forcing her to sway backwards and bend forwards, gasping for air from the sheer blunt trauma.

"Wha... what..?" She gasps out between breathes she is barely able to get out, swaying in pain.. still standing, however; as after a moment she steadies herself back up... and gasps out, grimacing.

"D..damnit... I'm not... finished like that." She manages to choke out... as she steels her blade in that two handed grip, shifting to thrust her blade in an impaling strike forwards; hand on the back of the pommel to increase the force of the thrust.

"Gyahh!"* - Sat Oct 31 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) freezes- eyes widening as the blade leaves her hands after the thrust is parried; leaving her standing before him, eyes wide, unarmed.

"That's..." She trails of- staring in awe. "..You're... too damn fast, that's insane.." She murmurs in quiet awe.* - Sat Oct 31 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: A good match, Miss Ketsuki. - Sat Oct 31 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: You will improve greatly in the future. - Sat Oct 31 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Your talent in the sword is only undermined because of my experience. - Sat Oct 31 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....On one hand... you're damn straight I will. - Sat Oct 31 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: On the other? - Sat Oct 31 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Don't call a one sided beat down a good match, yeah? I'm more than willing to admit- you're a hell of a lot better than me... there's no way that at my current level, I'd be able to land a hit... - Sat Oct 31 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Tch. - Sat Oct 31 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, maybe if I used my Genjutsu- but I've learned that busting that out in a spar just ain't right. - Sat Oct 31 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I see. - Sat Oct 31 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: You too are a genjutsu specialist. - Sat Oct 31 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I am too. - Sat Oct 31 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I'm sure you are a formidable opponent with the two in tandem. - Sat Oct 31 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, rubbing the back of her head before moving to go pick up the fallen sword, and sheathe it.

"..Still. I'm honored by that battle." She admits- before freezing as he says he's a GEnjutsu specialist as well, and grumbling.

"... What are you, just, older and better at /everything/ I do..!?" She protests, half complaining, half joking, as she sighs and tilts her head back.

"..Gyah... tch, with people like this running around, I really do need to get stronger.."* - Sat Oct 31 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Am I older than you? - Sat Oct 31 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I'm sixteen. - Sat Oct 31 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .. Gyah... - Sat Oct 31 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So you're not even older than me and you're this good..!? - Sat Oct 31 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Well... - Sat Oct 31 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Tch.. I shoulda joined the academy sooner.. - Sat Oct 31 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I've been through a lot on my end. - Sat Oct 31 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I only graduated... - Sat Oct 31 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Three weeks ago? - Sat Oct 31 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Because I joined late. - Sat Oct 31 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Then you have room for growth. - Sat Oct 31 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I have to find a new breakthrough in my training. - Sat Oct 31 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, rubbing the back of her head.

"You and me both.. the Hokage wants me to develop my elemental affinities- and I want to make more use of my Shunshin in battle.. still, I'm taking his advice instead, because I trust him.." She muses- before shrugging and chuckling.

"...Anyway. I guess you just proved to me that I need to train a lot more than I have been.. and that's saying something, considering how much of my time I spend training." She muses- before smiling gently.

"Anyway. I'll send the Raikage a letter for you. It's been nice meeting you, and speaking with you- maybe we can spar again sometime, when I've got a bit more experience."* - Sat Oct 31 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Of course, thank you. - Sat Oct 31 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: It was a pleasure meeting you, Miss Ketsuki. - Sat Oct 31 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I have to be off then. - Sat Oct 31 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrhrm! - Sat Oct 31 04:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Me either, he was quite fast. - Sat Oct 31 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It was practically inhuman.. - Sat Oct 31 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Lets head back. - Sat Oct 31 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Yeah. - Sat Oct 31 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Sat Oct 31 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...So. This is going to be your office soon, huh? - Sat Oct 31 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess. - Sat Oct 31 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You better make it back from that test alive to claim it. - Sat Oct 31 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ...wait. - Sat Oct 31 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Zeus said he would be doing. - Sat Oct 31 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Paperwork. - Sat Oct 31 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .... - Sat Oct 31 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Sat Oct 31 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Where the fuck is he? - Sat Oct 31 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: wait here one sec. - Sat Oct 31 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Welp. - Sat Oct 31 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: He probably. - Sat Oct 31 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Went to sleep. - Sat Oct 31 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, probably. - Sat Oct 31 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So uh... - Sat Oct 31 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: How are things with Ai? - Sat Oct 31 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I haven't seen him in a while. - Sat Oct 31 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Pretty good, we've been keeping in touch. - Sat Oct 31 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I mean to ask the Hokage for permission to go visit him in Sunagakure sometime soon. - Sat Oct 31 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You'd need Hassans permission more than Zeus' - Sat Oct 31 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: He barely allows anyone in now. - Sat Oct 31 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, but that can be asked for once I get there. I still need the Hokage's permission to leave the village and visit another. - Sat Oct 31 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess. - Sat Oct 31 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So um, How are things going for you in general? - Sat Oct 31 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, on one hand.. - Sat Oct 31 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I feel like I'm finally making progress. - Sat Oct 31 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: On the other? - Sat Oct 31 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I just found out that it's still not near enough just a few minutes ago, holy shit. - Sat Oct 31 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah but...that's why we train I guess. - Sat Oct 31 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: He's probably just been doing this longer than you...it's only natural. - Sat Oct 31 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I still think you're pretty good. - Sat Oct 31 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh... - Sat Oct 31 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I guess by normal standards I am.. - Sat Oct 31 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But not good enough yet. - Sat Oct 31 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: That doesn't matter though, you'll get better with time. - Sat Oct 31 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It matters if I get into a real fight, and I'm still this weak. - Sat Oct 31 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Well...thats why we have to get stronger I guess...you and me both. - Sat Oct 31 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Sat Oct 31 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Definitly.. - Sat Oct 31 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Anyway.. - Sat Oct 31 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Good luck, with whatever it is you end up doing. - Sat Oct 31 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah... - Sat Oct 31 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I've been meaning to ask you... - Sat Oct 31 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Sat Oct 31 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: A while back you said you didn't have a house. - Sat Oct 31 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Is that still the same situation you're n? - Sat Oct 31 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: No, actually. - Sat Oct 31 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh, Good. - Sat Oct 31 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ai-kun forced me to accept the charity of them renting a place out for me... - Sat Oct 31 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I still feel a bit awkward about that, but.. - Sat Oct 31 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Sat Oct 31 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: That's good. - Sat Oct 31 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: Damn...I was giving her my house in my will... - Sat Oct 31 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, I gotta go train a bit Ketsuki. - Sat Oct 31 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: See you around. - Sat Oct 31 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, I should do the same... see you, too. - Sat Oct 31 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks out onto the field and takes a deep breath. She clasps her hands together, and focuses intently.

"Yo, Takeda. Hope you don't mind sharing the training field." She says with a grin, as she sets down a satchel full of snacks and assorted foods, before cracking her shoulders.  She lowers herself into a tense stance.

"See, earlier got me thinking. Why not try to apply Shunshin in combat more efficiently?" She says with a grin.. as she lowers her stance...

Tenses.. and forms the handseals for Shunshin; flickering forwards. She reaches for her blade as soon as she breaks the handseals; but to her chagrin, still finds a decent gap between her flicker and her sword's slash.

"..Tch.."* - Sat Oct 31 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, Well. - Sat Oct 31 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: If you could reduce the effect of it. - Sat Oct 31 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: it would become quite a fierce tactic. - Sat Oct 31 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Reduce the side effects, you mean. - Sat Oct 31 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yes. - Sat Oct 31 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Worth the thought.. actually, the more I use it, the less I'm noticin the effects, so.. - Sat Oct 31 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods, accepting Takeda's advice and grinning as she collects herself from the dizziness.

"Guess I've just gotta do it over and over and over again!" She declares with a gleam in her eyes- as she retraces her steps... crouches.. and tenses for a kick this time. She forms the handseals; and launches herself through the air again, this time coming out with a kick; but again, with a notable delay before finishing the manuvear; and she sways on her landing badly.

"Ugh..." She groans, rubbing her forehead as she sits on the ground, before pushing herself back up to stand. "That dizziness is a bitch.."* - Sat Oct 31 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Keep at it Ketsuki. - Sat Oct 31 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods firmly, chuckling as she sways back and forth. She nods- steadying herself after a moment, as she holds her hands up- and once more, she flickers then reaches for a weapon.

Just slightly faster; just a few moments more fluidly.

"Ahaaa!" She gasps out, swaying back and forth with a grin. "..Tch.. I need to rest.." She muses, as she sits down to do just that after her third consequitive shunshin.* - Sat Oct 31 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You guys really don't give up. - Sat Oct 31 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stirs from her meditation eventually, stretching out.

"Huh..?" She stirs, looking around.

"Huh.. must have passed out while meditating.." She murmurs.
* - Sat Oct 31 08:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Doesn't that kill the purpose? - Sat Oct 31 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Or meditating. - Sat Oct 31 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...I s'pose it does. - Sat Oct 31 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) shrugs, chuckling softly, scratching the back of her head and sighing.* - Sat Oct 31 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You're name is Ketsuki, right? - Sat Oct 31 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Sat Oct 31 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Do you really use kenjutsu? - Sat Oct 31 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, why do you ask? - Sat Oct 31 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I was curious. - Sat Oct 31 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Why do you want to get so much stronger? - Sat Oct 31 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks about that, smiling faintly at Ziare.

"Before I answer- why do you ask?" She says softly- laying something on her lap that she didn't own earlier today; a simple katana in a white wooden sheathe.* - Sat Oct 31 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) shrugs at this, then chuckles; Katana resting in her lap.

"Well... I suppose on one note, I want to be strong for it's own sake- because being strong is the only way to guarantee survival... but on another level, I want to be strong for Konoha; this village, my home, is almost halfway dead from all the things that have happened to it; I gotta protect it. And on yet another level..?" She grins at this, chuckling again.

"I promised my boyfreind I wouldn't die while he was in Sunagakure, so I gotta be strong so as to survive, y'know?"* - Sat Oct 31 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and nods.

"Mrm... this is my home, even if it's not in the best of condition." She says- musing softly.

Little does Ziare understand; pretty women have boyfreinds because they are pretty.* - Sat Oct 31 08:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I understand. - Sat Oct 31 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I prefer this place too. - Sat Oct 31 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I was born here. - Sat Oct 31 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Raised here. - Sat Oct 31 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I fight mainly because I have to. - Sat Oct 31 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well.. - Sat Oct 31 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I like fighting, I won't lie. - Sat Oct 31 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm the future clan head, I was told I show a lot of potential. - Sat Oct 31 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh... I see. - Sat Oct 31 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Personally I prefer to just relax. - Sat Oct 31 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. - Sat Oct 31 08:39:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll catch you around.. - Sat Oct 31 08:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) shrugs, turning to walk away and calmly forming a Tiger seal as she does. A moment later- and she's simply gone, having used Shunshin to dissapear in a blur of motion as part of her continued training regime on using Shunshin casually, to increase her acclimatization to the jutsu; as she staggers along down the road after doing so.

"Oy vey.. Yeah, you to."* - Sat Oct 31 08:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: Maybe I should just give up... - Sat Oct 31 08:40:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Men like him are why I prefer to not fight at all. - Sun Nov  1 04:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But I prefer to live normally. - Sun Nov  1 04:56:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I just figure that every fight I lose? Is just more reason to keep trying. - Sun Nov  1 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You should be a poster child for tenacity. - Sun Nov  1 05:07:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Peace. - Sun Nov  1 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) steps into the area; seeming to appear from the trees; having been continuing her body flicker practice in the action of appearing on the scene as she seems to flicker in; fading with no smoke or flashy effects as she simply appears near too Takeda.

"Yo! Sup!" She says cheerily, as she holds up a bird clutching a message on her arm for him to retrieve.* - Mon Nov  2 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Takeda? - Mon Nov  2 04:56:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: He might even be able to make some stuff out of steel or silver soon. - Mon Nov  2 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: This the place, I think? - Mon Nov  2 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Anyway, you should talk to him if you get the chance. - Mon Nov  2 05:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) turns to smile and wave at Nori, grinning as she straps a second Katana to her waist, humming gently.

"Yo,  how you doin?" She inquires with a lax grin.* - Mon Nov  2 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh yeah... - Mon Nov  2 05:07:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stretches and cracks her shoulders- chuckling faintly as she looks to Takeda.

"So, you sure 'bout this?"* - Mon Nov  2 05:34:30 2015
