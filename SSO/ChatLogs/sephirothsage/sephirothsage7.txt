<br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah! - Thu Oct 29 05:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I have a few things I could help with there, if you're willing to negotiate. Whose this Lady Marissa? - Thu Oct 29 05:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: . . . . . . . - Thu Oct 29 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: . . .Ah, so this is Konohagakure.. - Thu Oct 29 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles brightly at Saeza, then blinks as yet another figure seems to join them at the gates of Konoha. She shifts from her discussion with Saeza to wave at him, smiling brightly- before looking back to Saeza thoughtfully.

"Welcome to Konoha to you to, sir! Now... Miss, what's your name? I don't suppose you'd care for a scroll on Shunshin no Jutsu?"* - Thu Oct 29 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: My name is Saeza. And no not really..I'll also purchase Genjutsu as well. - Thu Oct 29 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Thu Oct 29 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Seems like there's a lot of visitors today. - Thu Oct 29 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, well. - Thu Oct 29 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'm the only actual Konoha Shinobi still in town, so... - Thu Oct 29 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I think I'll get started on my search. - Thu Oct 29 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: What are you searching for Mister? - Thu Oct 29 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: That blacksmith's an elusive creature though. - Thu Oct 29 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I could help. - Thu Oct 29 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: -- - Thu Oct 29 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm searching for a blacksmith. - Thu Oct 29 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Me too! - Thu Oct 29 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: She doesn't remember me it appears. - Thu Oct 29 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Perhaps she has short-term memory. - Thu Oct 29 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Although, I specifically work on armor. - Thu Oct 29 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles apologetically to Saeza, rubbing the back of her head.

"Everyone else is either out of town, or dead.." She admits softly, sighing. "Toudou is from out of town, and I'm assisting him in his search.." She explains calmly. "If you'd like to help us, I'd be more than happy to accept- but it's his search, so.." She shrugs- before turning to smile at Marco.

"Ah- sorry to be rude. I'd like to welcome you to Konoha as well... and ah- we're looking for a very /specific/ blacksmith, not just any member of the profession; still, I'd be happy to take a look at your wares.. I don't suppose you have any armor that isn't too heavy?"* - Thu Oct 29 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Wait! It's a blacksmith right there! - Thu Oct 29 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah- but as I said, we're looking for a very specific blacksmith, an individual. - Thu Oct 29 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Not just any practioner of that profession.. - Thu Oct 29 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Ah. Carry on then.  - Thu Oct 29 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Though- I'd still like a look at your wares, if you'd care to trade, sir.. though I'd like to wait until after offering Saeza something myself.. - Thu Oct 29 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Saeza, right? I do have two scrolls other than Shunshin that might interest you, I think. - Thu Oct 29 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Oh yeah!? What are they? - Thu Oct 29 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah.. one's a Taijutsu technique I developed relatively recently, and the other's a very basic Genjutsu. - Thu Oct 29 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: It's fine for you to enter.  - Thu Oct 29 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Ah, I see sir. - Thu Oct 29 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Terms of what I'm looking for though. - Thu Oct 29 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Oh yeah? What are they called~ - Thu Oct 29 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm not seeking someone who can craft me good armor, or craft me good weaponry. - Thu Oct 29 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Dynamic Entry, and Death Mirage Jutsu. - Thu Oct 29 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Then what? - Thu Oct 29 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Hmm...I know both of those...Hmm..... - Thu Oct 29 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm more or less searching for a particular blacksmith. - Thu Oct 29 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Granted. - Thu Oct 29 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah.. Had a feeling you'd say that... Sorry, but you won't really find anyone else here, so... - Thu Oct 29 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm not saying I don't like you, Mister. - Thu Oct 29 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You look like someone who's capable. - Thu Oct 29 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Honestly, I've been living here in Konoha mostly alone for a while now, apart from taking trips with Toudou... - Thu Oct 29 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Anyway- then I take it you're not interested in any of those three Jutsu, then? - Thu Oct 29 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Oh yeah? Have you ever been to the Sand Village? - Thu Oct 29 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Seems legitimate. I have no issue. - Thu Oct 29 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Well, my boyfreind lives there, but I've never been. - Thu Oct 29 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Your boyfriend? What's his name? - Thu Oct 29 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, Ryouta Ai. - Thu Oct 29 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: ...That's a boy? - Thu Oct 29 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Thu Oct 29 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He just looks really feminine- but I can definitly promise. - Thu Oct 29 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I always thought he was a girl. - Thu Oct 29 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I know for a hundred percent sure. - Thu Oct 29 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That is a guy who acts girly. - Thu Oct 29 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: You shou- - Thu Oct 29 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I've checked. - Thu Oct 29 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: You should come to our village! - Thu Oct 29 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? What village are you from, miss Saeza? - Thu Oct 29 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Sunagakure is a pretty good village. - Thu Oct 29 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: She's from Sunagakure. - Thu Oct 29 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Thu Oct 29 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Yeah! How'd you know that guy? - Thu Oct 29 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Maybe, one day.. - Thu Oct 29 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: . . . . . . - Thu Oct 29 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But I can't give up on Konoha until Takeda's dead, or the Kage's definitly dead. - Thu Oct 29 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Loyalty and devotion. - Thu Oct 29 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Certainly qualities & assets all villages look for in ninja. - Thu Oct 29 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You'll do Konoha proud. - Thu Oct 29 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: This place is still my home, even if most of it's people are gone. - Thu Oct 29 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I've still got some hope for it, at least... - Thu Oct 29 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Who is Takeda? - Thu Oct 29 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Though admitably, if Zeus-Sama doesn't start sho- hrm? - Thu Oct 29 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I'm a good shinobi so I can help you kill them if they're evil. - Thu Oct 29 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Takeda's one of the other remaining Shinobi of Konoha. - Thu Oct 29 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Oh, no. - Thu Oct 29 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'm saying I won't give up on Konoha until all my comrades- like Takeda- are dead. - Thu Oct 29 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Y'know? - Thu Oct 29 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He's one of my few freinds. - Thu Oct 29 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Who is still, y'know.. - Thu Oct 29 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Alive. - Thu Oct 29 05:20:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mhrm.. - Thu Oct 29 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But, yeah. - Thu Oct 29 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Hmm..... - Thu Oct 29 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He's out on a trip looking to find out where our Kage went off too. - Thu Oct 29 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Well since you don't have anything. Here. - Thu Oct 29 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I dunno how that's going. - Thu Oct 29 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I see. - Thu Oct 29 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Thu Oct 29 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Speaking of which. . . . . - Thu Oct 29 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You said you could help me find a blacksmith? - Thu Oct 29 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You see a blonde guy lately? - Thu Oct 29 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: With a girl. - Thu Oct 29 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: She must've gotten in trouble or something. - Thu Oct 29 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: She's pretending to ignore me. - Thu Oct 29 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: ---Yeah that's horse shit. - Thu Oct 29 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks at this, tilting her head to the side- she doesn't refuse the money, but she does blink in suprise.

"Hrm- Oh! Thank you very much, Ma'am." She says- bowing her head gently. "...I am honored by this gift, and will find a way to repay you some day- however possible."* - Thu Oct 29 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: She must've been spanked hella hard. - Thu Oct 29 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: . . . Right. - Thu Oct 29 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Alright well. - Thu Oct 29 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Ketsuki, let's get going. - Thu Oct 29 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Decide our destination. - Thu Oct 29 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Welp. Bye sir! Hope tomorrow sees you well. - Thu Oct 29 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I think we should search outside of villages though. - Thu Oct 29 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And sure. - Thu Oct 29 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Alright. - Thu Oct 29 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Let's head out to... - Thu Oct 29 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Amegakure, and hit up any sideroads you know about on the way there? - Thu Oct 29 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Sure. - Thu Oct 29 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) skips freely into the wilds, frollicking beside Toudou.* - Thu Oct 29 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) continues to treck alongside the wilds with Toudou, looking around and humming as she does.

"So.... why are you hunting these guys down, anyway?" She asks as they walk through the woods.* - Thu Oct 29 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Uh. - Thu Oct 29 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well. - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: My intentions aren't exactly noble. - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'd like to beat the crud out of the blacksmith. - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And I think I'll leave it at that. - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Why? - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Annoying. - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I don't like the arrogant. - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Especially those who hide behind shields. - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You can't talk shit.... - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And hide behind a shield. - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Do you get my drift? - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Plus, his guard is a strong fighter. - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'd like to test myself. - Thu Oct 29 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah.. I guess I understand. Seems a bit messed up, but.. - Thu Oct 29 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yeah. - Thu Oct 29 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well, you know I'm not messed up at heart. - Thu Oct 29 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm a bit of a jackass, but I tend to mean well. - Thu Oct 29 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Especially when it comes to the people who've earned my respect. - Thu Oct 29 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs and shrugs as they walk along.

"I guess I getcha. 'S long as you don't y'know... go off to kill them, I guess it's fine to wanna fight them for talking shit." She admits calmly.* - Thu Oct 29 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: If I did kill them. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: It'd be a terrible accident. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Ketsuki, if there were ten people to die. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: --Okay here. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Thu Oct 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You control a kunai machine. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You can either kill your best friend. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Or ten random people. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... The hell? - Thu Oct 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Do you believe in utilitarianism? - Thu Oct 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Or are you more of a loyalist? - Thu Oct 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Kill one to save many, yeah? I get that idea.. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: That's utilitarianism. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Still, I'd rather save everyone. Kill only people who are actual threats, actual dangers. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: If you had no choice. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: What'd you do? - Thu Oct 29 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'd kill the ten. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: To save my best friend. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'd break the machine. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Clever. - Thu Oct 29 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) shrugs.

"Or, I'd aim it at a bunch of random schmucks... in a prison. You know the kind of place- maximum security and what not... Mrm." She shrugs and smiles, chuckling faintly.

"I'll explain. I value individuals- but... I like the idea of saving people. I like to do the right thing. In fact- I view it as part of being a Shinobi; helping people. It's our job, it's why these villages where founded, even; to use Chakra, to use our skills, to help our nations. I think people have lost sight of that, in all the war and chaos.." She trails of and sighs as she looks on- their treck continuing.

"Then again. I only have three or so freinds.. I can't afford to sacrifice any of them."* - Thu Oct 29 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You think that's why these villages were founded? - Thu Oct 29 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: That's so devastatingly far from the truth. - Thu Oct 29 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It was groups of Shinobi binding together for common purpose. Initially selfish- but.. - Thu Oct 29 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Mind if I uh, tell you something? - Thu Oct 29 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: They wouldn't have lasted long at all- or ever gained their Daiymos permission to exist.. - Thu Oct 29 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: The shinobi villages were created by the Gezo. - Thu Oct 29 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: If not for their value to oth- Hrm? - Thu Oct 29 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: The Daimyos were instated by the Gezo. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We're vassals. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: To do whatever the Gezo wants us to do. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I keep hearing about these 'Gezo', but I really have no idea who they are. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: They're the higher supremacy. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Gods of the world basically. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: They watch over us. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We're given mostly free reign. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: But if we start failing their missions. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....But what do they /want/..? - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: They're free to wipe out entire villages. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: ---That's a good question. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I've never thought about it. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Since they're so strong, you'd guess they'd do their jobs by themselves. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: But for some reason, they have us do it. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Unnerving. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That kind of thing.. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Probably means something. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I can't trust it. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm sure we'll figure it out when it comes to it. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: There has to be a reason- and it can't be for our benefit. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Clearly. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You ever read the history books? - Thu Oct 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Ever hear of Xavier and Xeno? - Thu Oct 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Double X? - Thu Oct 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Not usually- I focus on practicals. - Thu Oct 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: No, sorry. - Thu Oct 29 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: That's fine. - Thu Oct 29 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'll tell you about it one day. - Thu Oct 29 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Oh right, don't hit any Gezo Nobles. - Thu Oct 29 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: If you see them, at least. - Thu Oct 29 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: They'll probably act like jackasses but. - Thu Oct 29 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: If you touch them. - Thu Oct 29 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Your village is gone. - Thu Oct 29 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I see... Gezo nobles, huh..? - Thu Oct 29 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So.. how strong are these guys, anyway? - Thu Oct 29 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well. - Thu Oct 29 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Our Kages are only Sergeants. - Thu Oct 29 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And they rank their men based on... - Thu Oct 29 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Private to Sergeant to Field Commander to more. - Thu Oct 29 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: They've got ten-thousand Sergeants. - Thu Oct 29 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Basically, ten-thousand Kage-ranked soldiers. - Thu Oct 29 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks along, thinking quietly as she keeps her hands in her pockets along the walk of the grass.

".. Shinobi-Christ.." She murmurs- frowning. "....That's terrifying." She admits frankly, frowning worriedly. "We can't trust anyone with that kinda power.."* - Thu Oct 29 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Clearly. - Thu Oct 29 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: But, if I keep up my dream. - Thu Oct 29 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'll be a God of Fire. - Thu Oct 29 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's get going. - Thu Oct 29 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Look around. - Thu Oct 29 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Bit arrogant, aren't we? - Thu Oct 29 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Yeah, yeah.. - Thu Oct 29 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm a bit of a hypocrite myself. - Thu Oct 29 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: But at least I can back up what I say. - Thu Oct 29 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) continues to walk along the grassy roads, chuckling.

"I guess, yeah. Don't talk shit if you can't back it up, huh?"* - Thu Oct 29 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Basically. - Thu Oct 29 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Toudou. - Thu Oct 29 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We are so fucking lost. - Thu Oct 29 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks as they find themselves walking out onto a road, then sighs and scratches her head.

"Wonder where this leads.."* - Thu Oct 29 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yeah. - Thu Oct 29 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We're pretty lost. - Thu Oct 29 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Maybe we should've got a map. - Thu Oct 29 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Probably, yeah. - Thu Oct 29 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Okay, so.. - Thu Oct 29 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Any idea what direction to go from here? - Thu Oct 29 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Uh. - Thu Oct 29 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: East. - Thu Oct 29 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Just be careful. - Thu Oct 29 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Gotcha.. - Thu Oct 29 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, continuing to walk along the road- one hand resting on the hilt of her Tanto, the other hanging at her side loosely as she thinks quietly.

"...Mrm. Let's keep moving, I guess.. and hope we find something."* - Thu Oct 29 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Mmmm. - Thu Oct 29 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's buy you a new katana soon. - Thu Oct 29 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You got a lot of money. - Thu Oct 29 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Maybe if we find a Private or a Blacksmith. - Thu Oct 29 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. Yeah, maybe we'll work something out soon. - Thu Oct 29 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I've got around Six Hundred K.. - Thu Oct 29 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs as they walk around on the way.

"We've found another road.. Hrm." She shrugs as they walk along. "So, Toudou. YOu got any freinds?"* - Thu Oct 29 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Sure. - Thu Oct 29 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And.... - Thu Oct 29 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Friends? - Thu Oct 29 06:01:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Good guys, they are. - Thu Oct 29 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: What about me, huh? Not gonna mention me? - Thu Oct 29 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You're my friend too, Ketsuki. - Thu Oct 29 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: But we've never hung out at a hot springs yet. - Thu Oct 29 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh.. Hey, a bridge. - Thu Oct 29 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I hang out with everyone at hot springs. - Thu Oct 29 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: ---What about it? - Thu Oct 29 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Glad there's no crazy random Shark Jounin waiting to jump us at it. - Thu Oct 29 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: ...Hah. - Thu Oct 29 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Dunno, just a sign of civilization. - Thu Oct 29 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Is that a hut? - Thu Oct 29 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, but it's empty. - Thu Oct 29 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks up to the shore as they continue their epic journey and quest, a search for a blacksmith who isn't a dick.

"Man... this sure is taking forever, huh?" She muses as she looks out over the water, sighing as she shifts to sit on the beach.

"...Hrm. How do we get from here.."* - Thu Oct 29 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: This is Kirigakure. - Thu Oct 29 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....So we went totally the wrong way? - Thu Oct 29 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yup. - Thu Oct 29 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We won't be able to get into Kirigakure this way anywho. - Thu Oct 29 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So... - Thu Oct 29 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Seems the boat service isn't available at the moment. - Thu Oct 29 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let melook around. - Thu Oct 29 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Shall we head south from here, or..? - Thu Oct 29 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..Hrm? A'right.. - Thu Oct 29 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Lead the way. - Thu Oct 29 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Strange house in the middle of nowhere - Thu Oct 29 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks on that- then nods.

"Yeah, let's take a quick rest... find a cave or something- or take a look at that house, maybe?" She suggests, wiping sweat from her brow; in only slightly better condition.

"Let's rest up.. regardless."* - Thu Oct 29 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's go check the house I guess. - Thu Oct 29 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: If no one's in it, we can take it for the night. - Thu Oct 29 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You want to go check? - Thu Oct 29 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm a bit... tired. - Thu Oct 29 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You mean you don't wanna be the one to get shot if it's some crazy hobo. - Thu Oct 29 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: .....Mebbeh. - Thu Oct 29 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, yeah.. - Thu Oct 29 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I can't pick a lock, but.. - Thu Oct 29 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We'll see. - Thu Oct 29 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's locked. - Thu Oct 29 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Have fun. - Thu Oct 29 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I won't tell you why I have one of those. - Thu Oct 29 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) takes the pick down to the house, sighing as she rolls her eyes.

"A'right- but I don't know how to use it... you'd be better of doin this yourself."* - Thu Oct 29 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) crouches by the door- and begins to fiddle with the lock, wiggling the lockpick inside the hole of the door's lock, grimacing as she works at it, wincing.

"Hrngh.. What a pain.."* - Thu Oct 29 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: The pick broke. - Thu Oct 29 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: .... - Thu Oct 29 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Oh. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: That was my last one. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Ugh. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Think we should just bash the door open? - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Maybe burn the house down? - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Granted, the latter is counterintuitive. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I think burning the house down with no idea who lives there would be a /really/ fucking bad idea. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: If we want to house in it. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Point taken. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's go rest at the waterfall then. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We'll investigate more later. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, lead the way. - Thu Oct 29 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Come. - Thu Oct 29 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Huh. - Thu Oct 29 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nice Bridge. - Thu Oct 29 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sits down; crossing her legs into the lotus position as she stares down the waterfall and sighs; a gentle smile on her lips as she closes her eyes; and calms her breathing as she assumes a meditive posture.

"So, Toudou... got any idea where the hell we are?"* - Thu Oct 29 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I have no fucking clue. - Thu Oct 29 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well.. - Thu Oct 29 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hope we don't run into any giant monsters, huh? - Thu Oct 29 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yeah. - Thu Oct 29 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .. I mean, Bandits? - Thu Oct 29 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We could handle. - Thu Oct 29 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But giant monsters? - Thu Oct 29 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Fuck that shit. - Thu Oct 29 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Hah.... - Thu Oct 29 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You ever see a giant monster before? - Thu Oct 29 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nope. - Thu Oct 29 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: How about you? - Thu Oct 29 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Nope. - Thu Oct 29 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Ughh. - Thu Oct 29 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I wanna blow something up soon. - Thu Oct 29 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh. - Thu Oct 29 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah? - Thu Oct 29 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well.. we could spar again, butt... - Thu Oct 29 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Blowing me up would end poorly. - Thu Oct 29 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: For me. - Thu Oct 29 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I guess if you blow up that house, no one knows it was us. - Thu Oct 29 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Thoughts? - Thu Oct 29 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Nah, that'd be wrong. - Thu Oct 29 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yeah. - Thu Oct 29 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I mean. - Thu Oct 29 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We'll do it later. - Thu Oct 29 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let me get some shut-eye. - Thu Oct 29 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) yawns, shrugging at that as she lounges back.

"If you insist, I guess.."* - Thu Oct 29 06:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) yawns and shrugs, chuckling.

"Wouldn't be worth it if you wheren't awake for it."* - Thu Oct 29 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Clever girl. - Thu Oct 29 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Your boyfriend's told me to protect you though. - Thu Oct 29 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Would be problematic if your guardian died in the middle of sleeping. - Thu Oct 29 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: And then you get hit by a giant monster. - Thu Oct 29 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: With tentacles and slime oozing from it. - Thu Oct 29 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That doesn't sound so bad.~ - Thu Oct 29 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, yeah. - Thu Oct 29 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I get it. - Thu Oct 29 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Just- go the fuck to sleep. - Thu Oct 29 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Damn girl. - Thu Oct 29 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Harsh words. - Thu Oct 29 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You want to give me a little company? - Thu Oct 29 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hah! - Thu Oct 29 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Don't worry, I won't do anything your boyfriend wouldn't approve of.~ - Thu Oct 29 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Just a little touchy here. - Thu Oct 29 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Touchy there. - Thu Oct 29 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) rolls her eyes as she lays back against the bridge.

"Not interested."* - Thu Oct 29 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Haha. - Thu Oct 29 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Before I go to bed. - Thu Oct 29 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm going to set up some traps though. - Thu Oct 29 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) yawns, curling up to go to sleep in the middle of the bridge.

"Mrngh.. g'night."* - Thu Oct 29 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Night. - Thu Oct 29 07:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stirs a while later- yawning as she rises to stand. She cracks her shoulders- looks around.. notes her sleeping companion.. then smiles gently. She draws her Tanto, as she rises up to stand fully- cracking her shoulders before taking a stance on the bridge..

And begining to flow through her forms with the Tanto, treating it like an actual Katana as she lets her blade flow through the air forwards, sideways; diagonal. She's growing notably more fluid than before; and she likes it. Eventually, she sheathes it... before taking a deep breath.

"And now for my Chakra.." She muses- sighing as she begins to train with her Shunshin no Jutsu, using it to hone her chakra control; using the difficult technique to hone herself in more than one way at once, as she takes a step forwards, flickering.. collects herself, rests for a moment- then does it again.

And then she collapses, panting on her knee; as she focuses herself and returns to meditating on the bridge. 

"Mrm.."* - Thu Oct 29 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) heaves with physical exhaustion, bowing her head as she lapses into a deep meditive rest; letting sleep replenish her reserves after a while of meditation.

"Ugh.."* - Thu Oct 29 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) after a while of resting, Ketsuki rises back up; as there is little else to do in the wilds while her traveling companion sleeps, she resumes training; trying to work Taijutsu into her Kenjutsu this time, a leaping kick and a slash, working on pulling out of the landing for a Dynamic Entry to slash from that posture. It's clumsy at first- as transitioning between focusing on the length of her blade, and swining a bare fist, is not the easiest of work; but it's training that she feels is nesascary.

And in time, as she starts to work up a sweat; she once more transitions from using her physical arts, to practicing her chakra; again with a pair of Shunshins in quick successon that leave her head pounding painfully, and her body in pain; she just slumps where she landed, and does her best to control her breathing for a near meditive state.

"Still.. not good enough.. for mid combat.."* - Thu Oct 29 07:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) quietly sits down to begin eating; munching on trail rations to help replenish her energy as she heaves a sigh.

"I think that'll do it for tonight.." She murmurs groggily; head pounding from the chakra intensive trianing routine, not to mention the strain on her body as she finds herself hungrier after using Shunshin as well; wolfing down her food hungrily.* - Thu Oct 29 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yooo. - Thu Oct 29 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Sleep well on a bridge? - Thu Oct 29 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) seems to be already in a meditive state; having waited a while. She chuckles faintly as Toudou speaks- then nods.

"Yeah. You?"* - Thu Oct 29 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) facepalms.

"You know, if it's locked, someone lives there... it'd be pretty messed up to burn someones house down randomly- why don't we torch that hut that was in that little watery area instead? I mean, you'd feel pretty shit if you came home and your house was a pile of ash, yeah?'* - Thu Oct 29 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I suppose. - Thu Oct 29 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well you know. - Thu Oct 29 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Who would live all the way out here, though? - Thu Oct 29 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Retired Hitokiri Battosai's? - Thu Oct 29 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... people who don't want to be bothered by others? - Thu Oct 29 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I suppose. - Thu Oct 29 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hermits and what not. - Thu Oct 29 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Ugh. - Thu Oct 29 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Wanna go knock and see who's in there? - Thu Oct 29 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sure. - Thu Oct 29 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Just be careful. - Thu Oct 29 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) knocks on the door.* - Thu Oct 29 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: ...... - Fri Oct 30 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Not a thing. - Fri Oct 30 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Mmm. - Fri Oct 30 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: No one's in there then. - Fri Oct 30 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Burn it? - Fri Oct 30 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Ugh. I still think that's wrong, but.. - Fri Oct 30 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: If that's what'll make you happy, I s'pose. - Fri Oct 30 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) turns to look forwards, hands in her pockets- sighing.* - Fri Oct 30 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Okay. - Fri Oct 30 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I mean. - Fri Oct 30 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You don't seem pleased by the idea. - Fri Oct 30 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I won't if you don't want me to. - Fri Oct 30 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I mean.. - Fri Oct 30 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: This is someones house. - Fri Oct 30 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's kinda fucked up to just randomly burn it down. - Fri Oct 30 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: What if it isn't someone's house? - Fri Oct 30 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: What if it's abandoned? - Fri Oct 30 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares at Toudou.

"Look. It's clear you want to burn the house down- so just do it."* - Fri Oct 30 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: It's cool. - Fri Oct 30 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Anyway, we gonna burn this down or get moving? - Fri Oct 30 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Move I guess. - Fri Oct 30 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods, sighing as she tucks her hands into her pockets and begins to waltz away, grumbling.

"Yeah yeah.."* - Fri Oct 30 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks, looking around at the area near them.

".... What is this place? The hell?"* - Fri Oct 30 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Strange place. - Fri Oct 30 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Some kind of Arena? Or just a private garden.. - Fri Oct 30 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Who knows. - Fri Oct 30 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) shrugs, continuing the treck as she walks along- sighing at the extended journey.* - Fri Oct 30 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, as they walk up to Konoha- looking around quietly as she scratches her head.

"Ugh... what a useless trip, so far.."* - Fri Oct 30 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Well. - Fri Oct 30 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: At least you get to go outside. - Fri Oct 30 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, yeah.. - Fri Oct 30 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You seem sullen. - Fri Oct 30 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: What's up? - Fri Oct 30 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I was hopin to actually accomplish something.. Hey, what's this guys name, anyway? - Fri Oct 30 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I don't know his name. - Fri Oct 30 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Think it's Vessul. - Fri Oct 30 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Vessul, huh..? - Fri Oct 30 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I see.. - Fri Oct 30 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, rubbing her forehead and shaking her head.

"This sucks.... Well, we're home now... don't suppose you'd be game for another training sesh' out in the field?"* - Fri Oct 30 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Eh. - Fri Oct 30 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm not much of a trainer myself. - Fri Oct 30 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I mean, our last time was still the best training I've had in a while. - Fri Oct 30 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I suppose we could -train- together. - Fri Oct 30 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Not necessarily spar. - Fri Oct 30 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Fri Oct 30 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sure, that works for me. - Fri Oct 30 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I don't suppose you know how to use Shunshin already? I have this scroll Ai gave me- but I've already made all the use of it I can. - Fri Oct 30 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I do not know how to use the Shunshin. - Fri Oct 30 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Do you know how to generate circles of fire? - Fri Oct 30 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nope... but I also don't really have the skills to use Fire Jutsu. - Fri Oct 30 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Really? - Fri Oct 30 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Sorry to hear that. - Fri Oct 30 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: That's probably a bummer. - Fri Oct 30 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: ---Yo? - Fri Oct 30 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, there you are. - Fri Oct 30 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm looking for the Raikage. - Fri Oct 30 01:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: You had something to give to me? - Fri Oct 30 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I have no idea where she is, but I did send her a letter. - Fri Oct 30 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) throws a scroll at Toudou.

"I expect some kinda of repayment for this, but.. yeah."* - Fri Oct 30 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Oh---. - Fri Oct 30 01:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's the scroll I learned Shunshin from, so.. yeah. - Fri Oct 30 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Anyway.. - Fri Oct 30 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Amaya might not even be in the village, to be fair.. - Fri Oct 30 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We'll probably find her in it. - Fri Oct 30 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: That's my guess. - Fri Oct 30 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I guess... - Fri Oct 30 01:18:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Fri Oct 30 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So, anyway. You're just lookin for Amaya, then? - Fri Oct 30 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hope that goes well..  she might have left town to head to Sunagakure, though- I informed her by mail of something Ai told me. - Fri Oct 30 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Y'see, apparently Sunagakure's on high alert because they think Edge is going to attack them next. - Fri Oct 30 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: Ello there. - Fri Oct 30 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Fri Oct 30 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) turns to face Garachi, blinking.

"Hrm? Sup?" She says cheerily, hands in her pockets.* - Fri Oct 30 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: Anyone seen the Hokage around, or anyone who can train me for that matter... - Fri Oct 30 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, well.. - Fri Oct 30 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: The Hokage's not in town too much- out on errands I guess.. - Fri Oct 30 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But I could help you train. I take it you're another Genin? - Fri Oct 30 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: Yup, pretty fresh to. - Fri Oct 30 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah... well, I could try to help you out if you want. I'm relatively fresh myself- but I have a bit of experience... - Fri Oct 30 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: What specialty did you intend to go for? - Fri Oct 30 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: Taijutsu. - Fri Oct 30 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, I'm working on my Kenjutsu myself... Mrm. Well, I don't have a real weapon yet anyway- how about we head out to the training field, then? - Fri Oct 30 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I could certainly use the workout- and I know a few Taijutsu tricks.. actually, one might interest yah.. - Fri Oct 30 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: Cool, let's go. - Fri Oct 30 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: See you later, Toudou. - Fri Oct 30 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) turns to walk away, humming.* - Fri Oct 30 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) cracks her kneck and chuckles as they walk out onto the field, sighing gently.

"So, weapons or no weapons..?" She asks simply as she looks around the field with a faint smile.* - Fri Oct 30 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles and nods- stepping back and bowing, clasping her hands together.

"Alright then. Let's go, yeah? Prepare youreslf!" She says with a broad grin- as she crouches low for just a moment... before snapping out of the bow to launch herself like a missile at him; a flying kick through the air aimed directly at his face with the bottom of her foot.

"Yahoooo! Let's start the party!"* - Fri Oct 30 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) tenses against that foot, then launches slightly back; grinning at the impact of their mutual flying kicks as she bounces back, skidding along the sand as she tenses her fists.

"Not too bad, hah!"  She says with a broad grin; as the strength behind her kick off is perhaps suprising. She cracks her shoulders, raising her fists as she breaks out of skidding to lower fully into a stance.

"Now- come on and show me whatcha got."* - Fri Oct 30 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) steps forward as he lunges; grinning as she shifts to lift her left hand up to meet his palm strike- diverting it away from her stomach; it ends up impacting her forearm which is.. remarkably solid as she lashes out with a jab from her right towards the side of his face.

"Not bad... but not good enough, y'know?" She says conversationally, as her fist slams out for the side of his face to try and send him reeling back, as she steps backwards after calmly tanking his strike without really noticing it.

"Heh...Don't hold back, a'right?"* - Fri Oct 30 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as the other genin charges her. She braces herself, as she shifts her weight to her back foot; grinning faintly. She watches him rush- and rather than try to dodge, she reacts with an attack.

First, her left arm snaps up to smash into his ankle; pushing his kick away from her chin by smashing her fist upwards into it at full force; her knuckles bruising from taking the kick's force instead of her chin, as she then lunges forwards to slam her right arm directly forwards; aimed for his chest in a solid lunge towards his chest at suprisingly rapid speeds...

Even as she simply chooses to endure his two kicks; grinning wide as he once more impacts her rock hard body; causing pain, pushing her back even... 

But not majorly, suprisingly enough; as his hits leave bruises and little more.

"Hoh! That's a nice one, I definitly couldn't dodge it- but you need more FORCE!"* - Fri Oct 30 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) steps back and bows to her foe respectfully as he responds.. then chuckles softly, scratching her head and yawning.

"Mrm... Right. Sorry if I hurt yah a bit much, yeah?" She says, rubbing the back of her head sheepishly. "And.. ah... m'names Ketsuki- call me that, yeah? I'm not any higher rank than you, so calling me teach would be wierd." She explains gently.

"As for teaching you.. I used my only Taijutsu technique in that fight, and I don't know the Body Flicker well enough to teach it, so.."* - Fri Oct 30 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: Hmm fair enough. - Fri Oct 30 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: Thanks for the training session Ketsuki - Fri Oct 30 02:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I think if you put in enough work, you'll find yourself doing a lot better next time we fight. - Fri Oct 30 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: I plan on it. - Fri Oct 30 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Then maybe you should get more details.. - Fri Oct 30 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm. - Fri Oct 30 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks up to the mansion, yawning. She wipes a bit of sweat from her forehead; having apparently been training.

"Wow.. this is the most people I've seen in Konoha in ages.." She murmurs as she walks up- then looks over at Zeus, and smiles.

"Hokage-Sama, welcome home."* - Fri Oct 30 02:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I like that jutsu. - Fri Oct 30 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) jogs off to begin her patrol, humming as she keeps a steady pace along the road; headed for the gate to start with; a relaxed smile on her face as she keeps a practiced hand near her Tanto's hilt; already having begun to develop callouses from her hard work; something she's rather proud of. * - Fri Oct 30 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stretches out as she exits the Konoha gates and looks around, her posture lax and relaxed. Lacking suimen, she can't simply run up the walls and patrol along them; so she is forced to resort to simply patrolling just outside of town, through the lush woods that surround her home of Konoha. A lax smile rests on her lips- one hand resting on the hilt of her tanto, and the other hanging free at her side as she scratches the back of her head- looking around slowly but surely; knowing her eyesight isn't the best, and thus that she should make sure to check everything numerous times before moving on.

"Mrm.. nothin of note so far.." She muses as she turns to the right.* - Fri Oct 30 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) hums cheerfully as she walks through the auburn trees that veil Konoha; the fall season leaving the many tree's she walks past in all manner of beautiful shades; as if painted by some artist with an eye for richness in color. It's the middle of the night, and these colors are only visible in the torchlight, but that's fine by her, as she strolls through in the crisp nights air, tugging her heavy leather coat close.

"Mrm.. still nothin worth worryin about.. sure is pretty nice out, though.." She muses as she enjoys the chill quietly and calmly, humming as she strolls through the forest.* - Fri Oct 30 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) pauses to rest after a long while of walkin and searching through the darkness; shifting to lean against the trunk of one of the taller trees of the forest; a huge oak that seems to tower into the heavens above. 

"Where it daytime, you'd cast quite the shadow- but as it is... Mrm.... nighttime sure does change the world.." She muses as she yawns and chuckles- eyes quietly scanning the area as she muses aloud.

"Still.. a beautiful tree nonetheless." She admits softly, as she pushes off of the tree to continue on her trip, hands tucking into her pockets.* - Fri Oct 30 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) continues to hum a cheery tune, as her patrol takes her past the section of the wall just next to the training field inside the village- and she pauses to lean against the wall and listen in on whatever's happening on the other side, crooking an eyebrow up as she takes a listen from outside.

"Wonder how things are goin there..." She muses softly as she pauses her patrol to listen in..* - Fri Oct 30 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) eventually, tires of listening to metal clanging and the sounds of effort; pushing off of the wall to stretch out and yawn before she turns to head back down south; covering ground she already has on her way back to the gate; intending to simply loop around the other side of the village walls. Hands in her pocket and at her sides, she lopes of cheerily; but not before speaking aloud, audible to those in the training field..

"Good luck, you guys!~"* - Fri Oct 30 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stretches out and pauses to take another little while simply searching the area as she crosses past the gate once more, looking around with curious eyes as she scratches the back of her head.

"Hrm... this is kinda boring, but I s'pose it's worth the time spent to be absolutely sure.." She muses softly, eyes roving about. "Wonder if I'll run into any trouble on the other side of the village.." She muses as she continues along.* - Fri Oct 30 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) continues along outside the village, yawning as she patrols through the empty plains to the eastern side of the village. Walking by the water to the south was nice along that edge, but the east seems wide open and empty; on one hand, she muses, easy to see anyone approaching.

On the other, boring until someone does- and on yet another, she thinks, the most likely angle to be attacked from; best not let her guard down, she reminds herself.* - Fri Oct 30 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) groans aloud at the sheer emptiness of the eastern side; on the inside of the wall, a small forest and empty plains. On the outside, where she is- true emptiness, merely fields of rolling green grass as far as she can see; beautiful, in a bleak and endless sort of way; but lacking in color and variation to her eye, an infinite green waste.

"Oy vey.." She muses as she walks through it all, hands at her sides and shaking her head slowly.

"Wide and open enough to make a good battlefield, at least.."* - Fri Oct 30 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles as she hits cliff face and looks around, thinking.

"Mrm.. oh right, north of here is where I and  Toudouh.. right." She murmurs, then shrugs. "No biggie, I guess.. if a bit funny. Heh.." She muses- remembering the day and a half she spent completely lost in the wilderness with the strange fire-style user. A soft laugh escapes her as she heads on back down- continuing her idle stroll through the empty plains casually as she turns away from the cliffs; eyes still open and wary on her patrol.* - Fri Oct 30 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) pauses near the gates as her patrol comes to an end- stretching out as she looks around with a gentle smile.

"Well.. boring, but that's only because nothing happened while I was on patrol- which is still, definitly an important task for any Shinobi.." She muses aloud- stretcing out by the gate and yawning.

"Mrm... worth the time, at least." She muses- as she turns to head back to report.* - Fri Oct 30 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks back into the office, her leather coat a bit dirty from leaves and dirt encountered on her patrol, but otherwise fine; yawning.

"Mrm. Full patrol of Konoha's perimeter and outskirts performed, Hokage-Sama; nothing of note or worth reporting found, sir."* - Fri Oct 30 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Good work. - Fri Oct 30 03:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Nothing really. - Fri Oct 30 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Ketsuki, what elements do you know? - Fri Oct 30 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah... Hrm? - Fri Oct 30 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I have affinities with both Fire and Lightning, but no training in either. - Fri Oct 30 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I know a single Genjutsu and the Shunshin technique, as well. - Fri Oct 30 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Why do you ask, Sir? - Fri Oct 30 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I see. - Fri Oct 30 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Get some training in those elements soon. - Fri Oct 30 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: We need stronger ninja. - Fri Oct 30 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah.. right. I have no idea where to start on either, if I'm honest sir- though I have been working on my chakra control. - Fri Oct 30 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Still, my Kenjutsu has come significantly farther since we last met, Sir. I am working on my strength. - Fri Oct 30 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Excellent. - Fri Oct 30 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I may order you a sword if you keep working. - Fri Oct 30 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Prefer silver or steel? - Fri Oct 30 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Ah.... uhm... - Fri Oct 30 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Quickly now. - Fri Oct 30 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Which is better at killing things, sir? - Fri Oct 30 03:56:48 2015
