<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I know a Genjutsu, but have intent to pursue Kenjutsu as well; as things stand, Genjutsu is my only real skill so far. - Tue Oct 13 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Elementalist, Mid to Long range. - Tue Oct 13 00:17:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....Seems I'll have more incentive to pursue Kenjutsu instead, then, if these two already are an elementalist and a Genjutsu user.. - Tue Oct 13 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: So we have an Elementalist, a Genjutsu user, and a Kenjutsu user. - Tue Oct 13 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Now tell me what kind of Shinobi you are. - Tue Oct 13 00:18:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks at that question- then nods with a quiet smile. 

"I.... am a Shinobi who became one to help her village and it's people. I like to think of myself as a good person, but I recognize that sometimes unpleasant things are nesascary for the greater good of the village." She answers with a gentle smile.

"Beyond that... I spend most of my free time studying or training and... I've seen a real fight, once or twice before. I understand just how... chaotic and messy they can be, compared to what most people think."* - Tue Oct 13 00:21:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I know who you are. That doesn't mean I know what kind of Shinobi you are. - Tue Oct 13 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: For the first test, I'll be Piston Fisting each of you. If you get back up, you pass. - Tue Oct 13 00:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Our professional lives become our personal lives with how terrible all of these villages are. Who we are is who we are as a shinobi. It's required. - Tue Oct 13 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Okay then. - Tue Oct 13 00:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh, Thats a lot of stuff. - Tue Oct 13 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Show me your favorites. - Tue Oct 13 00:29:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: ((*Takeda Hideyoshi turns to the left, begining to build up his chakra within his body, kneading it into his stomach to produce a large quantity of water. As he was doing that he would raise his hands up and go through three handseals as fast as he could. Once the handseals were done he would breath in and pucker his lips, pushing forth the water he had kneading from his body and spiting it out into a stream of water, splashing water all over the ground. - Tue Oct 13 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares on in quiet awe- the insane movement on the part of the Chuunin combined with the strange transformation deeply confusing her as she fights the urge to step back.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I doubt he'll hit us. If he does he'll try to hit us from behind. - Tue Oct 13 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) thinks: He is telling his team of what is to come. Atleast he isn't so much of an ass not to give them a heads up. - Tue Oct 13 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: The lesson is to keep our guard up - if anything he'll try to use how paranoid we are against us. - Tue Oct 13 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's valid. At least he seemed to pull his punch- which is more than you'd get from a foe. I volunteer to go next. - Tue Oct 13 00:55:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks up, running a hand through her messy black hair and then turning to bow to Ambrocio.

"...Ah... I don't actually.. know Kenjutsu yet. I said I intended to pursue it, but that all I already know is Genjutsu. But.. if that is what you wish, so shall it be." She states calmly- as she reaches for the Tanto on her back.* - Tue Oct 13 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: That was like my first mission with Zeus. - Tue Oct 13 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: Hideki has weird eyes, Suitengu had weird eyes, Sabo had weird eyes, Ambrocio has a weird body - Tue Oct 13 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: Why is everyone weird? - Tue Oct 13 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) frowns at this quietly... but then nods, grinning. She draws the Tanto fully into her hand, and tenses against the ground. Her body is corded and wiry- lithe and firm. Her grip is shoddy for now, and it's clear by the two handed grip that she only really knows how to use a Tanto or Katana by watching others do so- not from actual training.. yet.

She puts one hand on the bottom of the hilt, as the other wraps around it, and lunges forwards; kicking up sand with her foot as she steps in to thrust the blade home towards her sensei's throat- fully expecting it to be parried.* - Tue Oct 13 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) turns to shift, grimacing as the Chuunin blurs away from her attempt. She tries to twist the blade in her hands- but it's fruitless as the older man in his transformed state seems to effortlessly blur aside- not even noticing the sand she meant to use to try and blind him to cover her attack.

She grimaces as his hand comes down to push her down- and she staggers forwards, barely keeping her footing as she pulls the blade back close- pivoting on her feet as she barely keeps herself standing..

As she stops staggering for just a moment, to slash upwards with the blade- this time not trying to get in so close, but leveling a wide and clumsy slash towards the face with one hand on the blades hilt as she struggles to keep any semblance of footing during the strike.

"Gyah..!"* - Tue Oct 13 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares in alarm as the blade skids across the surface of the biological shield- eyes widening as her mind races to fill in what's going on. Logic is applied, processes of her mind firing off rapidly- as she is trying to move, but..

Her body isn't near as fast as her mind, to be blunt and honest. She starts to pull away- but then he grabs one wrist, and the other hand is batted aside as she's yanked in close- the Tanto flying from her hand... and so she does the only thing left to do.

She braces her left leg against the ground, and brings her right up in an axe kick aimed for Ambrocio's groin as he pulls her in close, grunting aloud as fire flashes in her red eyes.* - Tue Oct 13 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) flies like team rocket.* - Tue Oct 13 01:26:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) staggers back as the pain of the kick induces him to let go of her hands. Her eyes flick to retrieving her weapon as she prepares to do something..

"Wait, what's that sou-" is the last thing they hear from her, before a solid blow strikes her in the calf; taking her legs out from under her and flipping her over him; much like someone who was just hit by a car.

As she tumbles through the air above him, she looks vaugely confused. As she hits the ground, she groans in pain.* - Tue Oct 13 01:27:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grunts quietly as she starts to slowly but surely, force herself to stand back up.

"I'll likely lean on it for some time. I'm actually quite good at it." She explains as she pushes herself up. "Kenjutsu is the goal, but... I'll need to use my Genjutsu to live long enough to get there." She admits shamelessly.* - Tue Oct 13 01:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: He left the village. - Tue Oct 13 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He left the village and took most of the funds for the village with him. - Tue Oct 13 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: .... - Tue Oct 13 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow at this, stroking her chin. She looks on curiously, head tilted to the side as she observes what he's doing, reading his reaction to finding out about Hideki's actions- and noting that he seems almost angry about it.

A sigh escapes the slender woman, as she crosses her arms and looks on. She recognizes the handseals as he's forming them, as it is a Jutsu she is well experienced with- but with the black leaves already falling. It's unnerving, at first- as shadowy shapes begin to form, and her mind is quickly snared despite her previous training...

But at the same time, she knows this Jutsu; and her mind is far from weak or foolish. As a vision of the village burning- as loneliness floods her, as a general picture of absolute solitude and aloneness rushes about her.. she recognizes that it is, indeed, an illussion. The only Genjutsu she herself knows, now turned against her.

She shudders unwillingly, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath as she crosses her arns- and notices him walking away, through the haze of it all; as she seems to almost experience double vision; the whole world burning around her, and images of everyone else dead or dying.. but at the same time, Hewa walking away from it.

"Hey, I don't think we're done." She manages to force out of her lips- even as the images force a cold sweat onto her.* - Tue Oct 13 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: A part from Ambrocio smacking us about, fine I guess. - Tue Oct 13 02:09:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) bows towards Sensei, before shaking him to snap him out of the Genjutsu as she runs away, frolicking freely in the wind.* - Tue Oct 13 02:18:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: See you later then. - Tue Oct 13 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) thinks: So much for dinner, but I understand. - Tue Oct 13 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks towards the construction site, looking around and sighing. This is her mission- to find a hole at this construction site.. and fill it. She tenses as she looks over the work site, then nods as she looks around for a shovel, and a hole to fill.* - Tue Oct 13 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) calmly continues to work with the shovel at the construction site; moving dirt from around into a hole that she was pointed at by the laborer's already working. She grunts from time to time- her headband already tied back to keep her hair out of her eyes as she works. The strain is constant and the burn low- but it's manual labor that drones on and on and on, rather than nesascarily being difficult in intensity.

"Hrnn.."* - Tue Oct 13 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grunts and sweats as the labor drags on and on- the dirt seeming heavier with every shovel load she dislodges out of the ground to pour into the hole that needs filling. She squares her stance as it goes on- focusing intently on her work as it drags on and on and on; her expression one of absolute effort and focus on her work.

It's far from glamorous, really- filling holes with dirt. But it needs to be done- and with that in mind, she simply decides to go about doing it as best she can, rather than worrying about that.* - Tue Oct 13 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) labors on the grunt work of filling a hole with dirt for hours and hours- sweat beading from her long before she's halfway done- but she pushes herself to keep going, simply slowing down slightly to conserve herself as it goes on and on- eyebrows furrowed in utter concentration as she labors away..* - Tue Oct 13 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) eventually, finishes. Wiping sweat from her brow, she smiles as she sets the shovel down- heaving a tired sigh as she looks at the hole and smiles. She turns towards the laborer's working over the rest, and gives them a thumbs up before waving goodbye and turning to walk away; headed home to rest a while as she cracks her shoulders and sways off- bone tired.

"Heh.."* - Tue Oct 13 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks in from the side, wiping yet more sweat from her forehead and chuckling softly.

"Phew... damn, but that took forever.." She murmurs as she looks around, pausing to wave at the two individuals she notices near the entrance to the village. "Oh, yo. Heya!"* - Tue Oct 13 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Names Ketsuki, Heya. - Tue Oct 13 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..You okay, Heiwa? - Tue Oct 13 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Uh. Nori. - Tue Oct 13 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: -- Nice to meetcha, Nori! - Tue Oct 13 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I'm fine. - Tue Oct 13 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And that's good.  - Tue Oct 13 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles gently- as she moves to lean against the fence next to Heiwa with a relaxed smile on her face; glistening with sweat as it is. She looks down towards the younger Shinobi, and smiles kindly.

"So. Yen for your thoughts?"* - Tue Oct 13 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles gently at Heiwa as she leans against the wall- and speaks honestly.

"Because you're my team-mate; and besides that, we're Shinobi of the Leaf, the both of us. You seemed really torn up about what you found out earlier; if you where related to the guy, I can see why. You seem unhappy- and I like seeing people happy. So... how about it- if you think it would help?"* - Tue Oct 13 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. I don't think it will. - Tue Oct 13 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well... what will? - Tue Oct 13 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Talking to you. It won't help. - Tue Oct 13 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: I wish I had earmuffs. . or is it earmutts? Oh well. - Tue Oct 13 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We've established that, yes. - Tue Oct 13 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So what /will/. - Tue Oct 13 04:02:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Right.. - Tue Oct 13 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm...  - Tue Oct 13 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: So. . . Is the ramen shop normally empty? - Tue Oct 13 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: W-what? - Tue Oct 13 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: The Ramen shop is empty?! - Tue Oct 13 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Noooo! That's awful! - Tue Oct 13 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ehhh. . Well, when I was there. . and saw stuff, yeah. - Tue Oct 13 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: How horrible.. - Tue Oct 13 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: How is that horrible. . ? - Tue Oct 13 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: The Ramen shop being empty means no more Ramen - Tue Oct 13 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And I love Ramen! - Tue Oct 13 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: !!!!!!!!!!!! - Tue Oct 13 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) seems to be absolutely serious, her eyes burning with worry.

"I'm not sure what I'd do without Ramen in my life.."* - Tue Oct 13 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Use a vendor? - Tue Oct 13 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .....Oh right. - Tue Oct 13 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Annnd gone. - Tue Oct 13 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks out onto the grass near the mansion construction site, and draws her Tanto. She takes a deep, steadying breath as she grasps the blade's hilt tight- and starts to move through basic forms for a Katana to practice.

The blade moves slowly through the air as she practices her footwork, and swiftly as she practices her strength. Her form is utterly sloppy, but she's working at it. Shifting her feet and stepping into blows- up and down swipes of the blade and sweeps at the air. She's intent on properly mastering the use of this blade- and perhaps eventually getting ahold of a proper sword, even; a thought that brings a smile to her lips as she continues to whip her short blade through the air.* - Tue Oct 13 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) steps back after a while of idly moving through the forms to hold her blade out from her chest. She takes in a deep breath, and sighs; quietly hoping she's not mistraining herself into a style that won't work at all through her attempt at self training. Still- there seems to be no one available to teach her, so here she is.

For now she returns to working on her body strength and tolerance- along with her form. She begins to simply repeat the same, simple Kata, over and over again. Down vertical, horizontal sweep. Down vertical, horizontal sweep. Down vertical, Horizontal sweep; over and over again.

Step forwards, down vertical, step back, horizontal sweep. She repeats it again and again; honing her muscle memory as she lets her feet shift through the grass repeatedly, only to repeat it. With the short blade she's using, it's far from perfect- but she lacks a bokken or actual Katana to train with.

"Hyrn..."* - Tue Oct 13 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) whispers: you're mine - Tue Oct 13 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) heaves a breath as she steps back from her most recent repitition of that form, to shift into another. A diagonal sweep as she steps forwards, followed by a reversal of the same sweep as she steps back and to the side. It's straining as she goes on- and sloppy. Still; repitition hones skill, and over time she gets used to the strenous movements of the sword, and moving her body and blade at the same time.

It's slow going; but progress is inevitable, really. Diagonals sometimes shift into horizontals or verticals by mistake, but she works on it; honing herself as much as she can to simply get a hold of the basics without anyone to train with.* - Tue Oct 13 20:19:24 2015

"And it's not rude when it's simply true."* - Wed Oct 14 01:04:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) looks around, taking quiet notes as the Genjutsu is enacted. The handseals are interesting, but as she looks around.. and notes the effects of the Jutsu.. she tilts her head to the side, nodding slowly.

"I see, an interesting Genjutsu." She says calmly- a smile on her face. "The fake clones everywhere. I can definitly see how that would be useful.."* - Wed Oct 14 01:12:06 2015
