"I'm strong. I want to be stronger- but the organizational system of ranking there explicitly prohibits women from reaching the same level of status as a men- I wouldn't ever be recognized for my strength, back home. So I decided 'fuck that shit', and came to be a Shinobi. I might go back, one day- just to rub it in everyones faces-... but that's a long, long ways away- I wont' risk that until I'm strong enough.. to no longer fear death."* - Thu Dec  3 09:25:20 2015

"Yeah... Let me simply say. The stories are mostly true, to be honest. I look forward to surpassing every single godamn one... Heh. And then, surpassing death itself..." She murmurs in a dreamy tone- her eyes misting over as thoughts and dreams flicker through her mind, and a smile plants itself on her face.* - Thu Dec  3 09:30:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Mitsunara! - Thu Dec  3 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) turns and smiles at Chikyu, waving and smiling.

"Yo, how you been- I don't suppose you'd be up for that spar about now, mrm?"* - Thu Dec  3 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins at the other girls response- then nods.

"Great!" She says with a broad grin- before turning to walk of, swaying her hips as she heads for the Arena. "I've been lookin forward to this- and I think I've just about finished knockin off all the rust I built up over my shitty mission.. Heh. I hope you've gotten stronger, Chikyu- cus I want a good fight, y'know?"* - Thu Dec  3 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) thinks: Lich King? - Thu Dec  3 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) cracks her shoulders and chuckles- smoothly drawing the plain, nameless Iron Katana she wears at her hips.

"Heh.. yeah, yeah- I read yah. Show me your moves, kid." She says with a lazy smile as she keeps her right hand lazily held low at her side, and holds her Katana out to her other side as well; a plain smile on her lips as she simply slightly tenses her legs.

"Move whenever you want..!" She teases idly- as she analyzes how best to get training out of this, and settles on utilizing some of her usually un-used Jutsu for this, to hone her less used skills... 

Even as she keeps her eyes on her freind and smiles peacefully.

"Man, I need more non-spar fights.."* - Thu Dec  3 10:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as she leans back while her foe lunges for her. The jab lunges forwards as she leans to the side- grazing her side and brushing against her flesh; the strong blow catching her, and causing minimal damage.

She twists as her foe changes position- and then grins as her foe moves to make a strike to her back.

She's not quick enough to avoid the attack entirely; but she can roll to take it elsewhere, and shift to take it somewheren ot so bad as her lower back- as this attack too, lands against the side of her body; drawing blood after it cuts through her dress...

Even as her body seems to explode with Raiton as she steps forwards into her foes guard past the blow that just struck her body... as her own right fist hammers in a brutal uppercut towards Chikyu's jaw- as she laughs boomingly- sword held in her left hand and slightly back, not yet made use of..

"Hah! Not bad, Girl! You really have gotten a lot stronger!"* - Thu Dec  3 10:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as her fluid motion pushes her back- stepping back as her foe flies back- as she shifts to relax into a more proper posture than before- as she experiments with something.

"Still need to work on takin hits- even if you sure as hell can dish em out, eh?" She teases idly as she relaxes back onto her foot- humming calmly as she puts her bare fist forwards and gestures for Chikyu to come back out her- as she flicks her katana into her hand out to the side- holding it backwards to face the flat end towards her foe rather than the blade...

Hoping to not cut into her if she does hit her.* - Thu Dec  3 10:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) laughs cheerily as her foe launches at her through the air. She steps back- and pumps chakra into her arms as she makes a broad sweep to interupt her foes attack.

She moves fluidly as she braces for her foes charge and turns to swing her blade. Her weapon seems to blur as her foe launches for her. She swings her blade upwards to meet her foes from the side- the crescent moon technique making her stroke near instant.... as in the moment afterwards, as the blade impacts her foes and holds it for a brief moment...

Her right hand snaps out for a blow to her foes chest, to interupt the barrage of kicks with a brutal punch.

"Hnghh...! Not bad at all..!" She roars with a laugh..!* - Thu Dec  3 10:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as she skids back after the brief clash, pulling her blade back and pivoting. She flows as her foe does.  She turns to face Chikyu as Chikyu turns to face her- with a lazy smile on her lips, and a fierce gleam in her eyes. She seems to burst with energy as she flexes while her foe moves forwards.

It's meant to stun a foe- but all it really accomplishes is training her control a little more- as she explodes with weak Raiton chakra while stepping to the side. She shifts to push her hand into the blade coming down- grunting as she meets it's charge head on while that electric force lances the air around her harshly...

A grin on her lips as her hand is forced down- bleeding down the palm from stopping that powerful stroke- as she thrusts with her Katana for her foes midsection while the light still shines around her- before fading away slowly... even as she makes her thrust while her arm feels the strain of parrying the huge blow.

"Hrnghh...... Haaaahh!" She roars out with a sound of exertation and glee- as blood sprays from her palm.* - Thu Dec  3 11:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts as her foe forces the blade to the side, as she pushes the blade aside- her blood smearing across it. She grunts as her attack is manuveared away by a hand on her hilt- something that manages to avert her stab, but is slow moving due to the contested nature of the contest of strength that is shifting her strike to the side...

And then a laugh, as a kick lands into her chest- and she pushes forwards to slam her head forwards to bash her skull into Chikyu's forehead- not quite at full strength to avoid possible brain damage, but... a laugh escapes her- as she pushes energy into her Katana...

And wraps the entire thing- including the hilt- briefly in flames before letting thsoe fade away, grunting.

"Ugh.. hah! Not bad..!"* - Thu Dec  3 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) staggers back- grunting as she holds up an arm to take the blow and sways back- she seems off her game, for some reason, as the blade barely cuts into her flesh; but manages to do so..

"Hrn... Ugh.... tch... I should keep fighting, but... I think I'm too tired, and I don't even know why..."* - Thu Dec  3 11:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah.. yeah, I just... Ugh.. - Thu Dec  3 11:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs, sighing as she sheathes her sword, and rubs her arm- frowning a bit.

"...I'll see you around, yeah? I think I just need some rest..."* - Thu Dec  3 11:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, yeah... - Thu Dec  3 11:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs and walks of- binding her slight wounds with her Kimono and walking of.* - Thu Dec  3 11:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Mitsunara! - Thu Dec  3 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) yawns- stretching out in boredome as she walks out into the square, looking around with half open eyes- before settling them on Chikyu, and chuckling faintly.

"Yo, Chikyu. How's it going- hah! Nice outfit. Is that happening soon, or did you just feel like dressing up early?" She inquires in a cheerful, curious tone- smiling in a lax, relaxed fashion.* - Thu Dec  3 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hi, Tsuki. - Thu Dec  3 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and nods, yawning sleepily.

"Mhrm- yeah. I was just a bit out of it last night, I guess... I'm all pent up, I s'pose- haven't had a real fight in ages, and apparently I missed all the real conflict... and I s'pose that has me bummed out- but it's whatever, yo." She says cheerfully, hands tucked into her pockets.

"I'm feelin a bit beter after a bit of a rest.. and I'm sure I'll feel even better once I manage to get a good mission."* - Thu Dec  3 20:19:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Oh, how is staying in my place going for you?  - Thu Dec  3 20:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Mrm..? It's comfortable, warm, and a decent place to sleep. I'm very grateful to you for it. - Thu Dec  3 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Is that maid outfit? - Thu Dec  3 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Yep! - Thu Dec  3 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Don't be grateful, feel free to stay as long as you need to. - Thu Dec  3 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh... thanks, yo. You're a real life saver. - Thu Dec  3 20:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Nope, just good friends. - Thu Dec  3 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles at Ivel's statement and shakes her head.

"Nah, she's just a good freind. I mean, sure- she looks pretty nice in that outfit. Buttt she's a bit young for my tastes."* - Thu Dec  3 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Interesting. - Thu Dec  3 20:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh. Peace out, yo. Good luck with that. - Thu Dec  3 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'm... gonna get some training done. - Thu Dec  3 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out and turns to walk towards the arena- humming calmly as she does.* - Thu Dec  3 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles as she relaxes against the side of a wall- and begins to form a series of handseals, focusing intently as she begins to formate a Bunshin. Her raiton chakra forms sloppily- and then she roughly shapes it into a Raiton Shadow Clone- smiling gently at the modified Kage Bunshin as she looks at it, nodding slowly.

"Hah... anddd there we go." She says cheerily at it, saluting it.

"Now what.." She murmurs as she stares at it..* - Thu Dec  3 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as she closes her eyes- and begins to focus on drawing her energy back in, while leaving the clone active as she focuses intently; calming herself as she gathers herself and centers her mind.

"Right... I've gotta get better at this shit.." She grumbles as she focuses- meditating on her chakra control to try and even out her expenditure for the Jutsu.

She breathes in, and then breathes out. She breathes in- and then out.. as she forms the handseals for the Jutsu again... and without dispersing the first clone, forms a second. The two clones begin to brawl off to the side as she sits down- exhausted after forming two, but smiling gently as her clones begin to train int he form of fighting each other as she focuses.* - Thu Dec  3 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts- rising as the clones continue to fight- lacking the strength to disperse each other, just as she lacks the strength to really harm herself without using special techniques. She chuckles at the two of them, as she rises- cracking her knuckles.

She can feel the persistent strain from maintaining the two shadow clones- and it's fine, as far as she is concerned. It's within her ability to cope with- as she forms more handseals, and adds a third clone to the mix, as she shifts to rest against a tree- as the clone battle becomes a threeway, and she chuckles.

"Mrm.." * - Thu Dec  3 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) after a little while of watching the clones fight- smiles gently. She steps in- and dispels them all at once. The rush of lightning runs over her body even as she reclaims her chakra; but it fails to stagger her inhumanly tough body as she accepts it all- and sighs out, before smiling as she steps back... and begins to form more handseals to form another clone.* - Thu Dec  3 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) keeps practicing on and on- working on that singular Jutsu with a mix of meditive contemplation, and repetitive forming of the seals; forming clones until she is exhausted, then reclaiming their chakra and meditating; a simple cycle meant to quickly enhance her skill with that more advanced Jutsu, a rigourous regime of hard work.* - Thu Dec  3 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) groans in exhaustion, as her work goes on and on. Her chakra control is, compared to that needed to do the jutsu properly without issue, slipshod and chaotic- but through sheer determination, she forces it to be enough, grimacing as she forces her chakra to flow and function as she wills it to; biting a lip as she pulls herself up- feeling drained and empty after so long- as she continues to rinse and repeat the process.

Form clones until exhausted.

Reclaim them in a rush of energy.

Lay back down to rest until ready to resume.* - Thu Dec  3 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) is, by this point, sweating as she relaxes back...

But she gets up- and forces herself to continue a little longer, after a short rest- intense focus on her features as she forces her hands through the seals again- groaning as more clones form.

"I deserve a big, hot meal after this.."* - Thu Dec  3 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks into the square and yawns, stretching out as she does.

"Phew... that shit's exhausting.." She murmurs- leaving it unsure what exactly she is talking about, really, but..* - Thu Dec  3 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: What was exhausting Mitsu? - Thu Dec  3 21:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Annoying. - Thu Dec  3 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Clones? - Thu Dec  3 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah? It's a Shinobi technique, Bryson. - Thu Dec  3 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Tangible clones made of chakra. - Thu Dec  3 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I don't like usin the technique seriously that much, but training it is good for my control, so I work on it for the sake of how difficult it is- and they are useful in training, because Ir eclaim their memories when they cease to exist. - Thu Dec  3 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Tangible? Really? - Thu Dec  3 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Meaning I can have a few of them fight each other while I meditate, and then disperse them and have trained both ways at once. - Thu Dec  3 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Thu Dec  3 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Thu Dec  3 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Not as strong as the original- each one is only about half as strong as the person that made them... - Thu Dec  3 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Thats quite amazing can I see it? - Thu Dec  3 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: But they are physical. - Thu Dec  3 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Eh? Sure, I s'pose. - Thu Dec  3 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: I'm already tired of seeing them damn shadow clones. . . .  - Thu Dec  3 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) forms a few handseals and sighs- as she focuses.. and expels chakra in the form of a clone of herself- which turns around and delivers a haymaker to Mitsunara's gut...

To absoltuely no effect, admitably.* - Thu Dec  3 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's weaker n' me by a lot- so it can't really hurt me.. but it is physical n' real. - Thu Dec  3 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Can I touch it? - Thu Dec  3 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles- nodding as the clone reaches for her sword, and draws it for her- standing and swinging it a few times for a demonstration- before chuckling the same sardonic laugh as it's creator and turning to look at Bryson, crooking an eye.

"Lewd priest, askin to touch a lady?" She teases- before shrugging and gesturing the clone forwards.

"Anyway, feel free I s'pose. I dont' much care. Any damage will disperse it, though."* - Thu Dec  3 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles at that and nods- as he pokes and prods the clown- which mockingly gasps in a teasing fashion at the touches- before dispersing..!

Into a rush of electric energy as she reclaims the spent chakra and chuckles- not even noticing the stunning surge of energy that expels from the clone as it is dispelled.* - Thu Dec  3 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *yawn* - Thu Dec  3 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and nods her agreement, stretching out.

"Mrm. It's hella hard for me, but... worth the learning because it's hard, you know? The difficulty of it and how unnatural it feels- it forces me to try much harder to use it than a normal person would... meaning it's better training." She says with a lazy smile, stretching out. She looks around, and waves at Momura.

"Yo, Momura. How you doin?"* - Thu Dec  3 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Yo. - Thu Dec  3 22:04:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Do you have a Lightning Affinity? - Thu Dec  3 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Cus that one's a Raiton Technique- and that's the only version I know, for now. - Thu Dec  3 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Nope. - Thu Dec  3 22:04:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Thu Dec  3 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) turns and grins at Izanami- and nods. The hard working young Psychopath chuckles at the other womans excitement, and nods.

"In that case. How about the three of us head on down to the Arena, neh?"* - Thu Dec  3 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Hmm? - Thu Dec  3 22:07:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'm only worried about exhaustin myself, with these kinda techs... Let's roll out, I s'pose. Meet yall there. - Thu Dec  3 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A'right, so. - Thu Dec  3 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Where do yall wanna start? - Thu Dec  3 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: The lightning shadow clone.~ - Thu Dec  3 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A'right- well. Just a warning? I'm no great master of this, so don't expect the most masterful of descriptions. Still- I'm sure you can get the hang of it easy enough. - Thu Dec  3 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: That's fine thank you. - Thu Dec  3 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles faintly, as she cracks her shoulders and smiles. She thinks about how to put it all- then nods slowly.

"Alright. You already know normal clones, yeah? I don't know normal Shadow Clones, but I'm going to assume some things about it, are simple. You focus intently, and shape your chakra; in this case, after shaping it and molding it into Raiton chakra.. and expel it into an external clone with a certain heavy density of chakra." She explains calmly- as she forms the clone, and it shimmers faintly- waving and smiling at Izanami.

"This clone is tangible- but formed of Raiton Chakra, meaning that when dispersed, it explodes into fucking lightning. Useful, right? Right. Plus, it is tangible- so it can do anything a Shadow Clone can, and uses your lightning techniques at your own full power." She lectures- chuckling as she dismisses her clone.

"So, what questions you got?"* - Thu Dec  3 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, shrugging.

"I uh.. don't really understand it much beyond the basics, though, to be honest.." She admits sheepishly. "Uhm... here- I think you'd be better of just taking the scroll I used to learn it."* - Thu Dec  3 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) coughs and tosses Izanami a scroll, from there... then shrugs.* - Thu Dec  3 22:33:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins. She's tensing as Koji makes his move- holding her Katana in a reverse grip so that the flat back of the blade is what she'll be striking with, rather than the keen edge.

Then he does something she wasn't expecting- even as she's tensing to strike as he closes. Rather than throw a punch... he begins to spin- suprising her greatly with his swift movements. She tenses as the explosion of chakra flows away from him towards her...

But it seems to wash over her like a strong breeze; as she seems to suffer no visible damage, enduring stoicly as it forces her back slightly initially..

And then she steps forwards through that twister of Chakra- grunting as she forces herself through it. She's smiling lazily, as she brings her blade forwards.. and it blurs.

It's not a normal strike, and the change is not just in the fow of things- as iron flows forwards- having more trouble enduring the rotiation than she herself actually is, it must be said- in a blurring crescent as she pours chakra into her arm for a swift strike to his midsection to try and knock him out of his spin, even as her right arm rears back for a punch.

"Tch! Not what I expected!" She teases idly.* - Fri Dec  4 00:50:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts and twists. She hadn't launched the punch yet, she'd just been tensing and rearing back to get ready to launch one as he rose. So she's not really committed forwards as he launches his own Jutsu. She's moving- but at the same time, she can't really see the attack coming.

Still- she's in movement... and while she can't see it- she can feel a rush of chakra from his limbs. Thankfully, the air palm is something somewhat slower than his normal physical attacks- and her focus has been utterly on her foe, as well.

So while she isn't able to fully dodge the attack... she is able to move to take it elsewhere- shifting her empty hand to take the attack for her other arm; as a joly runs through that arm, and leaves it twitching as it goes limp at her side... and she shifts.

As he launches a palm strike towards her body in the aftermath, and she swings her blade to meet his palm- intent on stopping his attack as she does.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces as her foe seems to flow around her attack. Her arm is jarred by the initial blow, but the second doesn't land as she's already pulling her sword back- and launching a haymaker for her foes chin as her arm tingles from the pain surgign from that first gentle fist strike- one that bores right through her tough hide, and strikes into her arm.

Even as her blade pulls back- slower than normal... even as her fist hammers forwards and she sways backwards.

She's not quick enough to really do much to stop him- so her arms are quickly stopped by his movements.. as she tenses one leg against the ground- then whips out for a kick to his groin with her other foot- hoping to catch him offguard while he's focused on her arms.

"I'll be in the mansion. If you want her to come, let her come. I really don't care at this point, Sanoke." She says lazily- heading of calmly.* - Fri Dec  4 02:43:50 2015

"Yo... So. Okay- some people /have/ already found out about this, but I'd still prefer it didn't become common knowledge, y'know-- so with that in mind... uh- sit down and get comfortable, yeah?

"Yeah, it's about being a Necromancer, and how I'm not originally from Sunagakure- but moved in here a few years back and enrolled as a student to slip in." She says bluntly- ignoring Mirai's general bitchiness.

"I feel it's important that I be straight with the Kage about this- and I'm pissed Bryson is just going around fucking /telling people/, because I expect sooner or later someone who realizes I'm a Necromancer is gonna fuck me up on principle rather than for any reason, and I like living here. I don't wanna get forced the fuck out by assholes... hence why I was trying to keep this on the down low." She admits-s ighing.* - Fri Dec  4 02:48:06 2015

"Yeah. I like violence, I enjoy killin- so I must be a one dimensional being with no personality or cares beyond that. Of course, that's how the world works. Right- now, are you going to stop spewing stupid shit, or..?" She trails of- an eyebrow crooked upwards.* - Fri Dec  4 02:50:40 2015

"Yeah.. I was pretty shitty at keeping it a secret, huh..? Ach, shit... well, I'm just glad there seems to be no issues with crazy ass white knights deciding to kill me for tormenting the souls of those I kill.. phew." She chuckles faintly, and sighs.

"Guess that's all we've got to talk about- though I guess, while Ig ot you here.. any missions available?"* - Fri Dec  4 02:54:04 2015
