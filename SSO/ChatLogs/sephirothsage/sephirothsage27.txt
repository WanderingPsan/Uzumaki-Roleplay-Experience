<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and shrugs, as she continues to eat and listens to him- before chuckling as she pauses and thinks.

"Mrm. Maybe... but still. It would lack.. a certain vital sense, I am sure- though I'd rather decline to talk more about this topic." She admits idly.* - Fri Dec  4 06:18:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles at that question- and shrugs.

"Not really? I know Chikyu probably has a crush on me- and I've told her I might consider her in a few years time, when she's a bit older... but at the moment? Not really, no." She admits calmly,* - Fri Dec  4 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) laughs softly- and shrugs.

"Well, you could consider this a date, I suppose. I don't mind spending time with you. I'm also incredibly unlikely to ever settle down for a stable relationship, but.. yeah. Sure- I'm willing to consider dating." She states with a lazy smile.* - Fri Dec  4 06:38:30 2015

"Ah... I see, I see. Interesting." She says cheerily as she looks at him- then chuckles. "You know, I'd have never guessed blacksmithing was a second choice in life for you, considering how good you are at it?"* - Fri Dec  4 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly- and shrugs.

"... You know what, fair enough. How old?" She inquires calmly.* - Fri Dec  4 07:20:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks into the mansion- and is confronted by two children. One is a skinny but tallish ten year old boy- and there is next to him an eight year old girl in a flowing robe who is seated on the pillows.

Mitsunara slowly looks between the two of them- and then forces a smile onto her face and speaks aloud, cheerfully.

"Hii!" She says brightly doing her best to look cheerful and pleasant towards the two clients- or more accurately, the clients two kids. She smiles brightly and waves...

And the kids just stare mutely. The girl coughs slightly- and the boy narrows his eyes suspicously.

"Is this mongrel the best we are to be afforded in caretakers..? Pfff.."* - Fri Dec  4 07:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs at the boys reaction- the sugary sweetness dropping out of her expression instantly.

"Kid. I may not be nobility- but I am both a Shinobi, and your assigned babysitter for now. Which means, kid- you will show some damn respect. Behave, and I might show you something cool to pass the time. Misbehave- and I will simply restrain you without harming you, and then report that you acted in a dishonorable and unruly fashion to the Kage when he files the report to your dad." She says bluntly- and the kid pales and stammers in shock..

As his sister giggles at seeing her snooty brother shut down almost immediately.

"Alright?" She says- to which the boy replies with a slight nod.. and her smile instantly returns!* - Fri Dec  4 07:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she walks in and looks over the two kids, thinking quietly.

"So... Hrm. Noble kids. What do nobility kids like to do for fun..." She murmurs, stroking her chin with a warm smile- as the girl smiles gently, and the boy frowns- narrowing his eyes suspicously.

"Ah! Okay, hobbies." She inquires of them- crooking an eyebrow up.

The boy thinks for a moment- then turns his nose up. "Ah.. I enjoy Horseback riding, the finer things in life, and reading... plebian." He says firmly- and then the girl giggles.

"Ah.. I like reading, and poetry, and painting.."* - Fri Dec  4 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles at the two kids- noting the differences between the two of themw ith  a slight nod.

"I see. Tell me- either of you at all interested in swords?" She asks hopefully. The girl frowns and shakes her head- but the boy's eyes light up as he nods. "Why, yes! I have long been told that swords are among the most honorable of weapons to wield, after all!" He says proudly- as she looks between the two, and thinks.

"Right.. good to know. Well- you kids hungry?" She inquires- as they both think for a moment- then nod slowly. "Right.. I'll get you something to eat, before we do anything else.."* - Fri Dec  4 07:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Oh..No, No... - Fri Dec  4 08:02:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks up- yawning.

"Well, the Daiymo sent a guy to pick the kids up. The older one was an asshole, but I stared at him funny and he fell in line... his little sister was adorable,t hough."* - Fri Dec  4 08:02:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's for fun. Isn't some feminist thing is that people shouldn't judge women for wanting to show off their bodies? - Fri Dec  4 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and shrugs as she yawns.

"...Man this discussion is funny.."* - Fri Dec  4 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: I didn't say it was feminist or not...this time...I just said...'I' specifically as a person don't want to objectify my body. - Fri Dec  4 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: for money. - Fri Dec  4 08:49:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly- an earnest smile on the girls lips.* - Fri Dec  4 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: I'm...a little scared. - Fri Dec  4 09:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Fear is nothing but a restraint. It's a psychological mindset that can hold you back! To truly be strong, you have to abandon your fear, and replace it with courage! - Fri Dec  4 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Right? Yeah, that's what he said. - Fri Dec  4 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: So, is there a date set, or..? - Fri Dec  4 09:18:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: A'right. Still- I'm fine to come over for Dinner whenever- and not just for this kind of thing. I enjoy spending time of any kind with what freinds I have, y'know. - Fri Dec  4 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: So anytime you guys wanna hang out- I am probably going to be available unless I'm fighting someone. - Fri Dec  4 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: I know~ I'm looking forward to it. - Fri Dec  4 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Anyway. I should teach you Shadow clone now right? - Fri Dec  4 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at Lera, crooking an eyebrow upwards- then grinning faintly.* - Fri Dec  4 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Ah- that'd be great, yeah. I'd certainly apreciate it. I've been working on my lightning clones, but I still don't feel comfortable enough teaching that... - Fri Dec  4 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Lets go then. - Fri Dec  4 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Righto, lead the way to wherever. - Fri Dec  4 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles warmly at Lera, and gestures for her to lead the way to wherever they want to do things.* - Fri Dec  4 09:20:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A'right, so. - Fri Dec  4 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Where do we start. - Fri Dec  4 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Well...since you already know how to make Lightning shadow clones - Fri Dec  4 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its pretty simple - Fri Dec  4 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Do exactly the same - Fri Dec  4 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah? - Fri Dec  4 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But take away the lightning - Fri Dec  4 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Gotcha.. so do it with normal chakra. - Fri Dec  4 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins at Lera at that suggestion, thinking for a moment.

"Right.. so gather up my chakra like I did- but don't vibrate it or anything to turn it into Raiton chakra... just pull it in and push it out into a tangible clone.. okay, so how do I make sure it's a Shadow Clone, and not a normal bunshin?" She inquires curiously- as she shapes her chakra and focuses...

And expels it..!

Into a totally normal Bunshin that she waves her hand through and lets disperse- chuckling.

"Ah, well.."* - Fri Dec  4 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hmmm. Yeah, its not massively easy. - Fri Dec  4 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly, thinking about what was just said- weighing it.

"So... a'right. Just... fill it with normal chakra, instead of Raiton chakra.." She murmurs- before nodding and smiling- standing back as she closes her eyes and breathes in... then out. Her chakra control isn't exactly the best- and neither are her reserves...

So doing these kind of things is draining for her- but that's why she likes having these techniques, if she's honest. For the sake of having them in training, rather than practical use, if she's honest...

As she forms the handseals... and expels chakra- shaping it into a clone of herself. It's unstable- but solid... and lacks the elemental nature of her usual result.

"Hahh.."* - Fri Dec  4 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Close! - Fri Dec  4 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You're nearly there. - Fri Dec  4 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: One more time. - Fri Dec  4 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and nods- breathhing in and out, and dispersing the unstable, chaotic clone that was just about to scream in pain at it's misbegotten existence... as she gathers her energy- and focuses.

She shunts it out smoothly- sloppily forcing it into her desired shape. She smiles faintly as it forms- not visibly different from one of her Raiton clones...

But then she punches it- and it just pops into shadow.* - Fri Dec  4 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Booyah. - Fri Dec  4 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Perfect~ - Fri Dec  4 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'm sure you've probably figured it out by now - Fri Dec  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Fri Dec  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But shadow clones hold a unique property. - Fri Dec  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: With how they relay their knowledge at 'death'..? - Fri Dec  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: All their experiences...everything they've done, goes straight back to you. - Fri Dec  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah - Fri Dec  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Though you also get their exhaustion...so be careful. - Fri Dec  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its easy to overstrain yourself like that. - Fri Dec  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... It's sad, but I like... - Fri Dec  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Instantly thought of numerous applications for that not even related to combat. - Fri Dec  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: .... - Fri Dec  4 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hahahahahaha - Fri Dec  4 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We think alike. - Fri Dec  4 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) coughs and blushes, and then shrugs.

"Anyway. Thanks for this, yeah? I'm sure it'll be damn useful- if nothing else, it'll be great for training, heh.. it's hard for me to manage the Jutsu- and I barely have the chakra to usei t... meaning it trains my control reallyyy well to practice it, y'know?" She explains with a warm smile.* - Fri Dec  4 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and nods.

"Yeah... my control's always been pretty good- but my actual reserves? Piddling, sadly." She admits- before chuckling.

"Meanwhile.. I can feel your freakish reserves without even trying. It's practically inhuman.."* - Fri Dec  4 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Heh...yeahhhh, I don't really understand it either. I just...kept getting more chakra somehow. - Fri Dec  4 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And it still keeps rising. Weird huh. - Fri Dec  4 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well.. however it works... - Fri Dec  4 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Your chakra is literally insane,. - Fri Dec  4 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You think so? - Fri Dec  4 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Like, it reminds me of this Jinchuuriki I knew once. - Fri Dec  4 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Your chakra reminds me of Tetsumi. - Fri Dec  4 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Huh? You know what a Jinchuuriki is? Interesting, thats not common knowledge. - Fri Dec  4 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Eh. I knew one as a freind, what can I say. - Fri Dec  4 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Fair enough. - Fri Dec  4 09:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and shrugs, leaning back.

"So, gotten the hang of the Crescent technique yet? Does it work right with that big honkin thing you call a sword?"* - Fri Dec  4 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah. I got the hang of it. - Fri Dec  4 09:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Cool. Y'like it? - Fri Dec  4 09:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm, it'll be good in a fight. - Fri Dec  4 09:56:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Anyway. S'pose that's all for now, yeah? I'll b sure to practice this Jutsu, though- to get the hang of it, mhrm. - Fri Dec  4 10:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alrighty~ - Fri Dec  4 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out and smiles.

"Yo... so, head back to the Arena, or..?" She inquires lazily.* - Fri Dec  4 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sure. - Fri Dec  4 10:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: What do you mea- Oh right, you can do that. - Fri Dec  4 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Uh huh - Fri Dec  4 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Sure, might be cool. - Fri Dec  4 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as they fly back- landingw with Lera. Her eyes widen at the sight before her- and then she chuckles.

"Woah, woah... Sanoke, chill... if you want someone executed, jsut tell me, Kazekage-Sama... chill..."* - Fri Dec  4 10:10:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Pretty good.  - Fri Dec  4 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) calmly hums- as she forms handseals and forms a Kage Bunshin. 

"I see, I see." She says cheerily- as she looks at the Bunshin- who nods and makes a sloppy salute before jogging of as she relaxes back to recoup her chakra loss- breathing in and out.

"Mrm.. I need to practice these techniquse more.." She murmurs as she smiles gently..* - Fri Dec  4 10:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles faintly as she relaxes back, thinking quietly.

"In other news, I've actually been thinking up my own Kenjutsu style... I just need to get some finer points down." She muses with a light smile as she focuses intently- and forms handseals again; shaping another Kage Bunshin that she waves to- and again, sends of to some unknowable task...

"So, Sanoke. I don't suppose there's anyone you particularly want dead?"* - Fri Dec  4 10:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yo, Chikyu! - Fri Dec  4 10:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Mitsunara! Hey Sanoke and Mirai! - Fri Dec  4 10:38:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hi. - Fri Dec  4 10:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) waves cheerily, before forming the handseals for another Kage Bunshin and forming another one- before sending it away, as well. She sighs cheerily as she let's that chakra drain fade away on her reserves- as she smiles gently at Chikyu and the others.

"How you doin?"* - Fri Dec  4 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah, I see. Mrm... well, if it hurts, you're still alive! Hah! - Fri Dec  4 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh? Took ya long enough. - Fri Dec  4 10:42:33 2015

"Ah... Right then. This is probably a trap.." She murmurs- before chcukling and shrug. "Let's head out, I s'pose." She says with a lazy smile, hands in her pockets as she looks to the other two with a smile.

"Well, this should be fun."* - Fri Dec  4 11:06:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) hums as they head out- hands in her pockets and a faint smile on her face. She looks over at Chikyu, as they walk along the path.

"So, you know where we're headed?" She inquires.* - Fri Dec  4 11:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) scratches her head and looks around, then sighs.

"Well.. guess we walk around the desert until we find this 'Taka' guy.."* - Fri Dec  4 11:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks on through the sand. The wind is starting to howl in the distance; but the monstrous sand storms that can cover miles at a time have yet to really kick into gear out here, near the edge of the desert... and Mitsunara still remembers the bleak hellscape of her homeland; to which this is... pleasant, in it's own way.

Her smile is relaxed- as they eventually sight a man in the middle of the sands- and she waves, setting down the map and tucking it into her robes.

"Yo! I think you're the guy we're here for, yeah? Ah.... with the Caravan and shit?"* - Fri Dec  4 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as she trudges through the heat and the wind- eyes alert as she expands her senses and looks around- before turning slightly to look at Mirai.

"Yo, Mirai. Mind scoping things out a bit-- check for traps or anything? THis entire mission reeks of 'trap'." She says lazily- before turning to continue her advance- eyes cautiously flickering about as she focuses on her own- admitably meager- sensory ability.

"Hrm.."* - Fri Dec  4 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs- nodding as she listens intently to Mirai's warnings- and nods.

"Right... got any way of marking the locations of the explosive tags? While tags usually aren't a real danger to me.... these might be different." She admits calmly- looking to the other two as she sighs... and thinks for a moment.

"Or.. hrm. I'll scout with a clone." She suggests calmly- as she forms a few aseals- and deploys a Raiton Bunshin ahead to scout for her. It jogs somewhat ahead, as the real Mitsunari stays back with Mirai- looking on calmly.

"Hrm.."* - Fri Dec  4 12:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: They are all around the place. - Fri Dec  4 12:31:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as the Raiton Bunshin is dispersed- and shrugs with a lazy smile as the clone explodes into lightning. She cracks her shoulders and leans back- staring forwards as the clone seems to have dissapeared.

"Hrm..? Well, I guess I could say planning isn't my strong point? Eh.... I was really hoping that this would be a smooth mission, to.." She muses idly- before chuckling. 

"So... what do you want, yeah? People don't randomly set up overcomplicated traps for no reason, after all." She states placidly.* - Fri Dec  4 12:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Wait, the Merchant is probably not re- - Fri Dec  4 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow up as the man fails to respond....

And then everything is whiteness. Explosions and fire and chaos. Sand turns to glass, and flame burns the air. An inferno of heat and pressure encases her body- and a roar of fury escapes her as she starts to advance. 

A barrage of Shuriken flicker through- and skid against her flesh, digging in... doing superficial damage as the burns lick her form and leave her practically nude- tatters of burnt cloth clinging to her form...

As she draws her sword while staggering forwards through the chaos- towards the source of it all, towards that man. She sways a bit- as if unsteady....

And a sickeningly low and predatory laugh escapes her lips- a gleam in her eyes as she bares teeth in a brutal smile- stepping forwards bit by bit against glassy sand that was burnt away...

"...Hahhhh..... what a blast!" She says with a giddy laugh as the flames stop licking her flesh- leaving her in pain, agony that might stop someone more sane.

Sanity was never Mitsunara's strong point, though.* - Fri Dec  4 13:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) waves cheerily- nodding at Lera- before turning to wave at Hiroshi as well.

"Hiro, yo." She says as well- before turning tos mile at Lera, yawning.

"Not too bad, not too bad at all." She says with a warm smile.* - Fri Dec  4 21:02:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles as she walks out into the arena- draws her sword... and wreathes it in fire- focusing on controlling the flames along her blade as she hums calmly; controlling them tightly as she yawns.

"How about you, Lera? How you doin?" SHe inquires- as she focuses on controlling the chakra flow of fire along her blade- humming calmly as she practices it.* - Fri Dec  4 21:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and nods- noticing the stares and almost seeming to preen, rather than be offended, as she starts to move through forms while holding the flame to her blade- savage cuts through the air that leave trails of smoke from the burning blade in her hand as she makes each step fluidly- humming calmly.

"Glad to hear it.. Hiroshi, how you doin?" She inquires- as she shifts to a two handed grip and begins to repetitively strike the air.* - Fri Dec  4 21:06:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and nods, as she continues to practice- upping the tempo of her movements as she steps forward- and with the sword still blazing, cuts through a crescent moon- her blade suddenly a red blur through the air as she pivots and rotates her body- breathing in... and out.

"Hah... that's good to hear, mhrm.."* - Fri Dec  4 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) enjoys this and grins as she continues to practice, humming calmly. She's fluid and calm, as she swings around her flaming sword with a single minded purpose- training. 

Still- the unexplained chill around her body is somewhat pleasant as a relief from the unabated heat of the desert, as she stops her blade at the apex of the first swing- to thrust forwards before swinging straight up in another crescent, grunting as she does.

"Hahh..." She murmurs as she pauses, holding the apex of that slash for a long moment...* - Fri Dec  4 21:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) gasps out- smiling warmly. A chill is running along her body- but it's a pleasant one. It may lack in physical contact- but the feeling of a chill running along her flesh beneath her robes is... suprisingly pleasant, considering the heat of the desert around her- it provides a sharp contrast that is, if she is entirely honest, pleasant.

She can assume that it's some kind of a haunting- but it's not near so bad as some of the ghastly interferences possible back home, so...

She chuckles softly and keeps training, flaming sword dancing along in the air through savage movements- slamming down from the apex of that slash to cut the air and burn as she pivots and swirls with the blade in her hands.

"Hahh... Mrm..." She murmurs- sighing out contentedly as she flows and steps around, a faint smile on her face.

"But then, I always do train hard." She admits- as she swings the blade up from the ground in another crescent.* - Fri Dec  4 21:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly, as she holds her blade in the air, before sliding it back to the side- still crackling with flames. She hums- as she makes another slice through the air before her body, grunting as the strain of moving her body so consistently through these movements is catching up with her, as her blade moves fludily through the air- burning crescent after burning crescent as she steps forwards then backwards after each stroke.

"Hah.... mrm. I'm familiar with that technique of Lera's. It's pretty cool- and if she uses it strongly enough, it really /can/ be flight." She agrees cheerfully... as she pauses after a crescent, breathing in and out as she takes a moment to recover her energy; closing her eyes as she rests for a moment- muscles slightly sore, and chakra reserves low.

"Hahh...." She murmurs- even as the chill aims itself... and she blushes a bit at that point- considering this is public. Her assumption changes to it being some kind of pervert's poltergeist- but that's fine, she supposes. She breathes in- and out... steeling her expression as she simply enjoys this.* - Fri Dec  4 21:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) let's out a low groan- masking it as a groan of strain, mostly... as her smile fails to fade. Her blade burns with that flaming chakra, as a dampness starts to cling to her undergarments. She breathes in- and out. In... and out.

And considers it another part of the training- keep her focus on her techniques while enjoying the ghosts... attentions upon her body. She groans lowly as the sensations run through her- a pleasant smile on her face as she keeps moving to make it look like she's enjoying the strain of her movements, rather than...

Anything else, or more unseemly... She sighs as she pauses at the tip of another crescent.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) is, of course, feeling nothing truly physical- just an intense chill that seems to move; it's like having air rippling on her body directly; but it provides a truly pleasant contrast from the heat of the desert... 

She turns and winks at Lera as the wielder of Samehada leaves.

"Later!" She says cheerfully- as she pauses in her practice and leans back- breathing in and out as she does, and standing straight as she lets the flame cease to coat her weapon.

"Ah, well.. I suppose that's enough of that.." She murmurs..* - Fri Dec  4 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Oh, hey girly. Feel like training with me? - Fri Dec  4 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) turns and smiles at Kinami- stretching out and thinking.

"Eh..? Well, I'm always game for training- sure. Not up to much else right now anyway."* - Fri Dec  4 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out and chuckles, stepping back.

"So, you wanna fight me, huh?" She says cheerily- Katana still held in hand. She stretches out and thinks for a moment- then chuckles.

"A'right. Shall we be holding back at first- or shall we go all out?" SHe inquires- as she turns to face her with a relaxed smile.* - Fri Dec  4 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) cracks her shoulders and nods- chuckling faintly as she relaxes back...

And then she takes two steps forwards- and grins. She steps forwards in a burst of speed- flowing forwards.. and her blade blurring.

It's a straightforward opening attack- a simple slash of her blade towards Kinami's chest.

"Names Mitsunara! Let's dance!" She says brightly- a tone of joy in her voice as she steps forwards to swing her blade towards her foes body- a straight diagonal cut from shoulder to hip- left to right.* - Fri Dec  4 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles. Her foes kick is too quick for her to react...

But too restrained to so much as budge her hands, or hurt her at all. The restrained strength of the blow doesn't seem to so much as faze her, as she plants a footforwards- and shifts her posture.

She turns the slash halfway down into a thrust- moving to pursue her foe and force her to keep backpeddaling as she grins wide.

"Hah! Not bad- but you'll need to hit a little harder to bother the likes of me!" She boasts fiercely as she thrusts her blade forwards- spearing it after her foe. Her footwork and bladework is smooth and self assured- and apparently, she's inhumanly tough... as she hopes to also catch her foe off balance mid-kick.* - Fri Dec  4 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins faintly as her foe manages to recover from being mid kick, and from being in the midst of attacking, to dodge backwards. She breathes softly, as she steps back in response. She's no good at properly dodging- but she does know how to roll with a blow.
She's hit in the chest-a nd she grunts... it hurts- it hurts like hell...

But she isn't one to slow down or be stunned by silly things like pain. She drops her sword intentionally, rather than being disarmed- as her wrists shift to a position above her head- and she grins.

"So.. you can take my hits.. huh.. guess I won't play around...!" She roars...!

And it all happens so damn quickly, as she leans into the womans attack- grunting as it drives the wind from her lungs and burns her chest...

And then she brings her hands down as she steps into her foes guard.

A weapon forms between her hands- a gleaming purple Nodachi... and then it expands to a monstrous size almost immediatly, as she swings it down for her foes shoulder- having stepped into her foes guard to make kicking her impractical and difficult before swinging down- as she brings her hands down so her wrists are meant to be inches from her foes shoulder, as the monstrous blade forms and expands.

It's a burst of motion- but the sheer brutal lethality of her blow.. even as she feels pain lance through her body from the powerful elbow- and makes it worse by stepping in...

She hopes to ensure at least a grazing hit- as the mosntrously huge NOdachi comes straight down...!* - Fri Dec  4 22:20:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) blinks... as someone does what /she/ usually does... and ignores her strongest attack. She's aware she could have done more- she could have wreathed it in flames.. but held back by memories of the last time she used this in a spar, and someone nearly died, she had deigned not to.

A fatal msitake- as the ground shatters beneath her foe- but her foe seems to endure it. She grimaces at that- as her blade is left against her foes shoulder. The suprise ensured the hit landed... but apparently, it wasn't enough to do damage. She snarls aloud- as she tenses down against her...

Bursting with an explosion of electric energy as her foe launches at her... before she is launched back by a kick to her chest- sending her flying and staggering back. She grimaces, as she holds her sword steady- as it shrinks to a more normal size- and she lands a short distance from her foe.

"Damn.... and that was my strongest attack, man... You gotta be even tougher n' me... and I've never seen /that/ kinda shit before..." She admits- chuckling softly as she does- swaying as she steadies herself.

"...In that case, I guess I've already lost this one.."* - Fri Dec  4 22:35:56 2015

"Well, I dropped the Katana in the sand over there. Feel free to pick it up!" She says with a relaxed smile.

"I'll want it back after the fight, though." She states- purple blade shimmering faintly as she steadies herself- breathing in and out as she copes with the pain lancing through her chest from the two insanely strong blows she took.* - Fri Dec  4 22:40:12 2015
