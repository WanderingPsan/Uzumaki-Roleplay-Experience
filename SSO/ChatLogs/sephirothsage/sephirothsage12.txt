<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly at that declaration. She holds back her right hand- holding her sword left handed as she sweeps upwards from hip to shoulder in a move that flows as she steps forwards.

It's a deft and skillfull stroke as she puts force behind the blade to sweep upwards while stepping forwards and slanting herself to stand sideways, minimizing her profile to her foe as she fluidly strokes with the blade.

"Let's dance, then." She says with a charming smile as she sweeps upwards to push her blade forwards against Paine.* - Sun Nov  8 21:55:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shifts her body as her foe shifts to the side and snaps out; smiling gently as she shifts to take the blow aimed at her neck to her shoulder; flowing forwards through it to move fluidly.

Or, that's the plan. Unlike the other man who fought her; this blow actually hurts. It holds her there for a moment- though she makes sure to avoid being struck in the neck with a slight motion, still taking the hit but not where it was meant to land.

It's jarring and painful; but it doesn't stop her as she endures the blow to bring her weapon back around with her left hand into her foes shoulders.

As her other hand that she had been holding back curls into a fist aimed for her foes gut- as her foe waits for her to rise, she attacks while in the action of rising; pushing her entire body into the attack as she flows up while striking out.

"That.... hurt.." She grunts out as she moves- sounding actively suprised by the idea of being hurt.* - Sun Nov  8 22:16:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as she stagers back. Her blow to her foes stomach is stopped; and her blade merely grazes her foes shoulder as she is forced back by the kick to the stomach; almost feeling the need to puke from that; before her intense physique lets her get a certain degree of control of herself to keep standing as she is forced back; grunting as she sways side to side and grins, shifting her posture as she plants her feet after being forced back, and shifts her blades grip to two handed.

"You're pretty good..~" She says- a note of glee entering the womans tone as she continues to not only work through the pain; but enjoy it, even. She sways slightly; momentarily unsteady, and with a slightly upset stomach...

But she's still standing proud and strong as she adjusts her grip on that Katana for an unknown purpose, and waits for her foe to come to her as she does her best to maintain posture- and thus maintain the advantage of reach. * - Sun Nov  8 23:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shifts as she hears the other womans words- and speaks frankly, her tone absolutely certain.

"Stop lying to me, woman. You are /not/ below average. At worst, you /are/ average- and likely far better." She scolds the woman- her tone actively angry for some reason as she shifts her posture to lean back onto her foot, crouching..

And then her foe dissapears. She grimaces, throwing herself back and sweeping her blade straight down blindly; unsure what's going on, unable to follow her foes movements at all as the figure blurs into her- likely only being grazed if touched at all by the blade before a blow lands that launches her backwards diagonally upwards and back; grimacing as she tucks her arms and legs in tight and holds her blade.

"Nani..!?"* - Sun Nov  8 23:45:55 2015

'Definitly.. lying about her own skill... this is nowhere near my level- this is way above... damnit, how did I get into a fight with someone like /this/..?' She thinks to herself- as the kick slams into her gut and cracks a few ribs- not breaking them fully, but causing definite internal damage..

Before slamming her into the ground- as she coughs out blood; eyes wide in shock at the impact she was just dealt.

"Guyah.. I wasn't sayin.. to fight harder.. I was sayin... you're better n' you say you are..." She groans out in response to the womans words..

As she debates internally for a moment...before pushing herself up and swaying as she stabilizes herself slowly. "...Still.. standin though." She grunts out- swaying from side to side in obviously intense pain.* - Mon Nov  9 00:07:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) steps back as her foe rushes her. She grunts- moving pains her in her current state. Rather than sweep and expose her hands, she relies on a simple fact.

Her sword, in her hands, has more reach than just her foes hands. It is, for now, slower- definitly. But she has range; compared to someone who fights unarmed. As she sees that hand ready to lunge out- she aims for her foes wrist with the blade; keeping her grip on the hilt close to herself as she moves deftly to the side; displaying a suprising degree of skill.

She's grinning wide despite the pain she's in.. even as that hand snaps out for her throat. She grimaces, as she shifts to once more try and take that on the shoulder- if succesful, enduring the pain that jars through her.

If not, likely staggering back in pain yet agani- this time having trouble breathing.* - Mon Nov  9 00:34:33 2015

"Ah... I just finished a spar. I think the chick accidentally cracked a few ribs, among other things." She explains calmly, wincing. The womans examination likely yields the obvious.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods and smiles as she accepts the hand up, shifting upwards as she accepts the bottle of water.


"I should be fine- thanks for the assistance, Miss.." She says- a serene smile on her lips as she looks into Kiyoko's eyes. "Is there anything I can do to help you out, while you're here, or at all..? I don't have too much of my own to do, after all."* - Mon Nov  9 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah. ypi - Mon Nov  9 01:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: W-We work at a restaurant, y-you can come w-with us! - Mon Nov  9 01:18:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: T-This place? - Mon Nov  9 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Mon Nov  9 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah, there you are. - Mon Nov  9 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: . . . - Mon Nov  9 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles peacefully as she shifts to be seated, yawning and stretching.

"Mrm.. So, what is your name? I'm Mitsunara." She says warmly as she relaxes into her seat.* - Mon Nov  9 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: U-Uhm..H-Hi, I'll be your w-waitress f-for today.. - Mon Nov  9 01:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles serenely at Momura, hands tucked into her robe.

"Ah, well. I would like.." She trails of, thinking. "A ramen dish, if you can- as spicy as you can make it." She says simply- before looking back to Kiyoko, a sedate smile on her lips.

"As I said- I am Mitsunara. You are?"* - Mon Nov  9 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: ..... - Mon Nov  9 01:55:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly- a quiet and almost serene air about her as she relaxes compltely.

"Hrm.. It's a pleasure to meet you, too. So I am curious, I think. What made you decide to become a medic?" She enquires curiously.* - Mon Nov  9 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: Making the noodles for ramen is too difficult. - Mon Nov  9 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: I could make the broth... I guess. - Mon Nov  9 02:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: U-Um, I'm not sure. - Mon Nov  9 02:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: O-Or does she perhaps enjoy a more hard taste? - Mon Nov  9 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: I-I'm not sure. - Mon Nov  9 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I was just curious. - Mon Nov  9 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: As to why you decided to become a Medic? - Mon Nov  9 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh right... well see, I actually only recently became a shinobi. Before that I was a nurse, I have been a nurse since the earliest age of being able to attend the classes. - Mon Nov  9 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I've wanted to be a nurse since I was a little girl. - Mon Nov  9 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see- can I ask why you wanted to be a nurse, then? - Mon Nov  9 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I had a school trip to the hospital, that made my decision. To help people. - Mon Nov  9 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So you want to help people, huh..? - Mon Nov  9 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov  9 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: For your own sake, or theirs? - Mon Nov  9 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: That is- is this a selfish desire to feel good from their gratitude, or a desire to pursue the good of others? - Mon Nov  9 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles in a languid, almost predatory fashion.

"When ones goal is just to help people, rather than to serve a cause or ideal, it generally comes down to a more base reason. Most people just want to feel like they are good people because they helped others and thus must be good people- self gratification from the act of assisting others. Meanwhile, others do it because that is what they where told is righteousness, and they want to be righteous. Some do it because they have no self esteem, and view themselves as lesser- and thus place a priority on the well being of others that leads to assisting them at cost to themselves in a self destructive spiral- and some very, very few.." She laughs softly.

"Are truly selfless. Those are the ones that are absolutely doomed to self destruction, of course."* - Mon Nov  9 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So, which do you think you are? - Mon Nov  9 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stares calmly at Kiyoko.

"Ah, but violence helps people too. Your family of Shinobi helped plenty of people- your village and it's leadership, for one." She says with a relaxed smile. "By being a medic, you are helping people no more or less than they where."* - Mon Nov  9 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) leans into her hands and smiles gently.

"It's no more or less valid than your own, of course."* - Mon Nov  9 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: He's taking a while.. - Mon Nov  9 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she lounges backwards in her seat- eyes remaining on the medic.

"So... You've only been a Shinobi for a little while, huh..? I wonder. Do you at all know how to fight?"* - Mon Nov  9 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah, very good. - Mon Nov  9 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Only a short while...no I don't know how to fight....not at all. - Mon Nov  9 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see! - Mon Nov  9 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Maybe I could help teach you sometime- out away from the Arena, so no one feels embarassed, yeah? - Mon Nov  9 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....I wouldn't be embarrassed...probably...but I'll think about it, I'm really just a shut in at the hospital. - Mon Nov  9 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It'd be nice to get a good work out. - Mon Nov  9 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Like I said, I'll think on it. - Mon Nov  9 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Of ourse, yeah. - Mon Nov  9 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, smiling serenely.

"Ah, indeed. It's fine- don't worry. I hope you have a good day, yeah? Come look for me if you ever.. need someone to talk to again, yes?'* - Mon Nov  9 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: O-Oh.... - Mon Nov  9 03:05:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-One moment! - Mon Nov  9 03:07:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out as she rises, leaving a small wad of money on the table before turning to walk away.

"Thank you for the meal. Good day."* - Mon Nov  9 03:34:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out as she approaches the Arena, smiling faintly.

"Ah.. hello there, everyone." She says with a relaxed, sedate smile- by now, having rested enough to fully heal from her earlier fights.* - Mon Nov  9 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hi there... and welcome back *@Marrisa* did you find your rock. - Mon Nov  9 03:37:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Ahh! Then, what are you doing her- Oh...well thats awful. - Mon Nov  9 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out her shoulders, and smiles- noting the large weapon on the other swordswomans back as she strokes her chin.

"Hrm... a fellow swordswoman- I don't suppose you'd be willing to accept a challenge to a sparring match?" She says warmly.* - Mon Nov  9 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: It's the price I pay for being a Jounin of the Sand.  - Mon Nov  9 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Rock? - Mon Nov  9 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I'll see you all in a bit - Mon Nov  9 03:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Sounds like a boring test. - Mon Nov  9 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Sounds like a philosophical one. - Mon Nov  9 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Phil o soft cycle? - Mon Nov  9 03:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: ...Philo...phi-whatever. She needs to find a rock with a cute face that was thrown. - Mon Nov  9 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Oh. - Mon Nov  9 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Huh. Interesting. Anyway.. - Mon Nov  9 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Is that what a philo-..philo test is. - Mon Nov  9 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Would you accept my challenge? - Mon Nov  9 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: What challenge? - Mon Nov  9 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And ... not so much, nevermind. That's wierd. - Mon Nov  9 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? I asked my fellow swordswoman if she'd like to spar. - Mon Nov  9 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Oh. - Mon Nov  9 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: I'll spar you. - Mon Nov  9 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I could, but I'm pretty weak. Don't know if you be interested in fighting me. - Mon Nov  9 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: If you want. - Mon Nov  9 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah, I am but a Genin myself.. so I'm unsure.  - Mon Nov  9 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Either of you is fine, I suppose. - Mon Nov  9 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Whichever of you wants to fight more. - Mon Nov  9 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I think, I've lost to almost everyone in the village except that attacker this morning. Hahaha! - Mon Nov  9 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: My, I see.. - Mon Nov  9 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Well. - Mon Nov  9 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hmmm... he seemed happy to spar, even though it was at me. So, I think hes far more excited. But, I can save a match for you next time we meet. - Mon Nov  9 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: The swordsman might need the exerience. - Mon Nov  9 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Nah, you got it. - Mon Nov  9 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm.. How about this. - Mon Nov  9 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'll spar you, Miss.. - Mon Nov  9 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And if it goes as you said it would, I'll spar him after... for now, though. - Mon Nov  9 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Let's see whose steel is stronger. - Mon Nov  9 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I am Mitsunara. Let us fight. - Mon Nov  9 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Chikyu over here, again. Pleasure to meet. - Mon Nov  9 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks and moves to stand across from her foe- then mimics her foes bow, before drawing her sword into a two handed grip. It's a finely made Katana; a simple, plain thing of Iron that rests easily in her hands.

"So, show me your fighting spirit, shall you..? Show me the strength you have inside you!" She says fiercely, as she steels herself into a fighting posture.

"C'mon and hit me with all you got!"* - Mon Nov  9 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shifts her body forwards. Her flow is smooth and firm as she shifts her body to the side. She's simply not fast enough to fully dodge her foes attack; so she instead opts to shift so as to take it in the side rather than head on...

And that is when Chikyu runs into a problem. Striking this persons body is like striking iron; in terms of sheer ressellience, her body repels the blade from her flesh.

She smiles, as in that moment she strikes.

It's a smooth, flowing arc of her Katana straight down upon her foes shoulder in a strong, two handed slash; as she steps through that strike to her side with barely a notice given to it- as she speaks in a serene, cheerful tone.

"Smart opener- but not enough force." She says in that peaceful tone- as her blade is coming straight down for Chikyu's shoulder in a two handed strike.* - Mon Nov  9 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daishou(Simple.Sloth) says: ....What're you weirdos doin'? - Mon Nov  9 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles as her foe reacts smoothly; dropping the blade and switching too unarmed. Her foes armguard hits the blade; and holds it there as the weapon locks against the parry for a moment, before the rotating arm forces her to the side and back...

As she pivots to the side; moving with the force of the deflection to keep moving in that direction as she delivers a smooth kick to her foes side from the opposite side as she veers to the side.

"Huyaah! Ahh! Not bad at all!" She says cheerily.* - Mon Nov  9 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs slightly, staring at Chikyu with a slight frown.

"Mrm... I was hoping for more- I won't lie. Still; that determination will help you greatly in the days to come." She states warmly, as she shifts her blade back into a two handed grip.

"So... do you want to keep trying..? Or.." She whispers something lower.* - Mon Nov  9 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: If you want, I could help you train outside the village, secretly. Away from others so it's not so embarassing. If you where just a bit stronger, you'd definitly be on my level- and I'd want that to happen. - Mon Nov  9 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: After all, I fight for the sake of the challenge. - Mon Nov  9 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: .... - Mon Nov  9 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) takes a firm posture- and nods as the other woman speaks; a low laugh escapes her.

"Very well then. One more hit? I'll remember that." She says simply; a serene smile on another time. "And as for the other note- after you've rested afte I've won." She states pridefully..

Before she steps forwards again. She shifts to a one handed- left handed, in fact- grip on her sword. She holds her right out to her side, as she holds her blade out ot the other side...

And then she takes two fluid steps forwards diagonally, a lazy but swift sweep of her sword towards her foes center of mass this time, as her right rears back to deliver a high-punch in quick succession after that; a second between each stroke to make reacting to both confusing as she can.* - Mon Nov  9 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) lets her Katana fly free in the clash; as her hand then snaps out and ends the battle in a fluid punch.

"My, that was a good technique." She compliments her foe- who is likely simply unsteadied and dizzy, not unconscious, due to a certain degree of restraint in the womans blow. She smiles gently as she turns to go and pick her Katana back up, before sheathing it.

"You have a lot of potential, with techniques like that- definitly so. You just need more raw strength and focused skill behind it.. Hrm... so."* - Mon Nov  9 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: How about we head out to train for a bit after you've rested? - Mon Nov  9 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and nods, throwing up a thumbs up to her opponent.

"Heh. I've worked very hard at it, you know..? I'm an immigrant from far away, you see- and where I was born, women are looked down on greatly when it comes to combat. With that in mind, I've striven to prove that I am as fine a warrior if not finer than any man, y'know?" She explains warmly.* - Mon Nov  9 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles serenely and nods.

"Yeah, since coming here several years ago, I've found that this land is much more. .equal, between the genders. It makes things easier- but I still have something to prove, I feel.. you know?" She says with a faint chuckle.* - Mon Nov  9 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at that, and shrugs.

"I fully intend to become... 'The Strongest'. That is my goal- not 'The Strongest Woman', but 'The Strongest'.  I want to prove this, by actually becoming 'The Strongest'... the Strongest Warrior in the world." She says- a faint gleam in her eyes as she grins and looks at her new freind.

"What do you think?"* - Mon Nov  9 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh.. - Mon Nov  9 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, if you intend to be in my way... - Mon Nov  9 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'll have to prove to you why that's foolish. - Mon Nov  9 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: In the mean time, though, I'll just seem to help you along. - Mon Nov  9 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's better if you're at least a challenge.~ - Mon Nov  9 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh... - Mon Nov  9 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So, how about we get something to eat..? - Mon Nov  9 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: And then head out like I said, once you've got some food in you? - Mon Nov  9 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I want it to be a secret, because I have some moves I want to keep a secret, y'know? - Mon Nov  9 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sounds good to me. - Mon Nov  9 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods, smiling serenely.

"Well, let's go get a bite, then."* - Mon Nov  9 05:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm.. - Mon Nov  9 05:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yoko(Dark_Kadaj12) says: ... - Mon Nov  9 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles peacefully as they enter the resturant.

"So.. how about an agreement. You show me how me the basics of how to use one of your techniques while we train- then I show you one of mine. How about it?" She says cheerily as she sits down in the resturant- away from the ears of other Shinobi.* - Mon Nov  9 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Fair enough. - Mon Nov  9 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: In that case, just general tips and working out, mhrm. - Mon Nov  9 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sounds good to me.  - Mon Nov  9 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles calmly.

"I know a place out in the desert that is pretty good for it, I like to think. There's also  a waterfall a ways out past the desert, into the forest, that is great for endurance training." She explains, as she looks around- then orders a bowl of simple ramen for her own meal.* - Mon Nov  9 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: That sounds like a pretty good place, but thats also a no can do.  - Mon Nov  9 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Mon Nov  9 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So, you want to stay near to town then, yeah? - Mon Nov  9 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Fair enough. I just don't want to stand in the Arena, because I'll be using something that I don't like showing off, or being well known. - Mon Nov  9 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I won't be showing you how to use it, but it's still not something I want more than one or two other people really being aware of, y'know? - Mon Nov  9 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Theres a bunch of corners in the village. The walls are guarded by shinobi, but if they're loafing off enough to watch genin fight.  Then, you won't have to worry about them  learning your techiniques from watching them. - Mon Nov  9 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I suppose that's true. Still- you can understand my paranoia when it comes to a family technique, yeah? - Mon Nov  9 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Of course, teaching someone a techinque or even showing it to you. Is giving a person the advantage of a techinique that could mean life and death. When you hand something that important to someone else, you have be sure you chosen carefully...even in family. - Mon Nov  9 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Definitly. - Mon Nov  9 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah! And there is our food. - Mon Nov  9 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. I'll admit, part of this is selfish on my part. - Mon Nov  9 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I need a chance to practice this thing outside of the public eye, with someone who won't go telling others, who is at just the right level to give me a really good fight, without either of us totally overwhelming the other. - Mon Nov  9 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: That way, I can train for long periods of time at once, while not unveiling things, mhrm. - Mon Nov  9 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, a serene smile on her face.

"Mrm. Thank you for that gesture of trust- I will be sure to repay it with secrecy and honor. After all; I want my rival to be just as good as I am, until I can prove absolutely that I am better." She says- a playful smile on her lips, as she slurps up Ramen.* - Mon Nov  9 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly.

"So you use your own techniques in a spar- but not your families special ones unless it's a real fight. About fair?"* - Mon Nov  9 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: No... something else... my dad hasn't taught me them. - Mon Nov  9 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Not yet, at least, I take it. - Mon Nov  9 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slightly- a gentle expression on the womans face as she looks at Chikyu thoughtfully- those cold, analytical eyes resting on the other Genin, but her smile warm and gentle.

"I see...Ghastly, huh..? As in... if used on a person, you knew they would be immensely brutal..? Or almost.. supernatural seeming?"* - Mon Nov  9 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly.

"Either to fight monsters.. or turn battles against other humans into simple slaughter..? Something you should think about there is this... high ranking shinobi are closer to monsters than to humans, physically."* - Mon Nov  9 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its rather scary...ha..ha... It felt like a beast that didn't need to eat or protect itself was standing before my eyes. Just...pure...instint to kill. - Mon Nov  9 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see.. fascinating. - Mon Nov  9 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So... anyway. Done eating? - Mon Nov  9 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Yeah...yeah. Sorry for the long story. - Mon Nov  9 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Not a problem! - Mon Nov  9 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It was interesting. - Mon Nov  9 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, what do you want to do. Try another spar in secret? - Mon Nov  9 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, sounds good. It's night now, so a good time for it. - Mon Nov  9 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: We'll find somewhere a ways out from where people normally go- or we can just spar inside my house, yeah? - Mon Nov  9 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Your house sound fine. - Mon Nov  9 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. In that case, follow me yeah? - Mon Nov  9 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sure... lead the way, Miss warrior. - Mon Nov  9 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles peacefully as she rises to stand, stretching out and yawning.* - Mon Nov  9 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: . Right.. - Mon Nov  9 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Just remembered I never asked Yan for keys... - Mon Nov  9 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Want to go see if hes around? - Mon Nov  9 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: .... Nah.. while he did give me an open offer to stay there, I feel a bit off about bringing guests before I even have keys myself. - Mon Nov  9 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It would feel rude. - Mon Nov  9 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Do you have a place, or shall we just find an isolated corner? - Mon Nov  9 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I haven't bought a place yet. Hehe... but I think if we fight in the corner behind these buildings. It should give us enough cover not to be noticed. - Mon Nov  9 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Right.. so a bit out this way. - Mon Nov  9 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So.... first thing is first. You're pretty good with that sword- but I couldn't help but notice. - Mon Nov  9 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Your durability and other defensive traits where quite poor. - Mon Nov  9 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Correct me if I'm wrong- but so far, you've placed a heavy emphasis on offensive traits, yes? - Mon Nov  9 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I suppose it does come with using a sword of that size, though. Still; it /is/ a big sword. - Mon Nov  9 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Have you considered using your weapon as more of a... a shield, almost? - Mon Nov  9 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's a large enough weapon to do so, allowing you to rely more on it's durability than your own. - Mon Nov  9 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I do sometimes, but I'm too slow often to pick it up in time.  - Mon Nov  9 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, as she holds a hand out to her side, and nods..

"Then let's work on that.. while I work on what /I/ wanted to train.. yeah?" She says warmly; as she holds her hands together in front of herself.. not reaching for her Katana- but instead...

She focuses inwards. Then outwards. She clings to the air; and energy from within herself begins to gather and flux. It's a dark purple color, as it forms and twists in her hands; a long blade, longer than her Katana's by a noticeable length.

She sweats slightly with effort; and it finishes condensing into her hands; first the blade, then the hilt; a blade of purple steel, a hilt of blackness. The scabbard forms at her hip, long and extended; as she holds herself steady.

"This... is the blade of my soul."* - Mon Nov  9 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) holds the Nodachi in a smooth two handed grip; and it's clear right away that this is her true weapon of choice and preference. It seems to sit naturally in her hands as she chuckles and nods- bowing her head in Chikyu's direction.

"Yes.. this blade is my greatest technique, as of yet. It is a resonance of my soul into a weapon that I hold in my hands; a pure blade formed of my spirit and internal self. This is my self, my being- this is what I am. A sword." She says firmly, as she then holds it in that two handed grip low- tip nearly touching the ground of the suprisingly long Katana.* - Mon Nov  9 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Now. Let's work on your defense, shall we? - Mon Nov  9 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, a serene smile on her lips as she crouches low.

"Of course not- you are absolutely right. We don't want to risk any permanant damage, no?" She says cheerily, before stepping forwards. Her blade is long- nearly as tall as she is.. but she wields it almost with the fluidity of a normal Katana as she steps forwards; moving to deliver a long, low sweep towards her training partners legs as she steps and puts her body behind the blow, moving to the side to move with the hilt to guide the blade; like a long, gleaming lever.* - Mon Nov  9 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles gently as the blades meet. She steps backwards, this time; leveraging the edge of her blade against the edge of her foes to sweep in as she steps up from the crouch and lurches backwards- hooking her blade in against the other weapons hilt for a lunge to the gut as she lifts her foes weapon out of the ground if her foe doesn't act quick- as she in effect takes advantage of the clash of blades to use her foes weapon as a lever for her own unnatural one.

"Hah! Right- now let's see how you deal with the second part of a two part attack, yeah? Adapt!" She says cheerfully; her eyes gleaming faintly as she flows to the side.

"You're free to hit back- but this is to work on your defense, remember!"* - Mon Nov  9 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles faintly as that strange purple blade draws a thin line of blood, nodding slightly... as she steps back, blade in hands.

"Hrm.. I see. You need to think more expansively. That attack of mine wasn't all that creative- but because you thought I'd already been parried, you didn't expect another in the same motion; a mistake! Any thrust can also become a sweep; and a blocked blow can easily become a thrust!" She states chidingly, as she steps back and assumes a firm posture.

Her blade is held in both hands, high and parralel to her chest.* - Mon Nov  9 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs at that request, standing absolutely still with her blade in both hands.

"If you like. I leave the decision of when to quit up to you."* - Mon Nov  9 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Haha... good night then. You're staying with Yan right? - Mon Nov  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, he offered. - Mon Nov  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I've yet to give him my answer, admitably. - Mon Nov  9 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well next time, you should know his house is in the north eastern district. He invited me to the party there. - Mon Nov  9 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, that was the first place I checked. - Mon Nov  9 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... But I'm horrible with directions.. - Mon Nov  9 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) flushes with a blush of obvious embarassment, rubbing the back of her head.

"Anyway, you should run along home. I'm going to practice my Kata out here a while longer, yeah?" She says cheerily.* - Mon Nov  9 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, the first thing we swordsmen should do is sheathe ourselves after practice. - Mon Nov  9 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: But I intend to keep using mine, and it's very draining to summon it! - Mon Nov  9 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she says that and then shrugs.

"Ah, well. Still- I suppose I don't have to dismiss it to sheathe it." She admits- sliding the spectral blade into it's spectrals cabbard- then bowing respectfully.

"Good day then, jah?"* - Mon Nov  9 06:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) seems to wave a cheerful goodbye as her new freind leaves the area, as she looks around and sighs- before turning to look at one of the Catci, and drawing her sword back out to deliver a stroke towards the cacti.

She seems to split it down the middle, but sighs. "Ah.. not perfect... anyway! Sleep tight, Chikyu-chan!" She says brightly as she begins to practice.* - Mon Nov  9 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Wait...Akimora... - Mon Nov  9 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah? - Mon Nov  9 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: What do you think of swordsman ship? - Mon Nov  9 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Mon Nov  9 06:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It is my life, I suppose you could say. It is not just a style of combat, but something that differs from person to person. By seeing how someone truly fights, you can see their soul. - Mon Nov  9 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. - Mon Nov  9 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It is a craft of honor and dignity. Pride and spirit. - Mon Nov  9 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I hope you can match me in it well enough to make me bleed, one day, yes? Yes, I think that'll be very fun. - Mon Nov  9 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Is that so... well, I guess I can't agree with that. Because, I've  told you about my father, if I believe that then I would see him as only cruel and merciless...but my father is a loving man. - Mon Nov  9 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ones soul is not the same as ones heart, or ones mind. - Mon Nov  9 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You can choose to act differently than your soul dictates, if your heart wills it, or your mind calls to it. - Mon Nov  9 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: One's soul is one's nature- and one's nature is rarely how one truly acts. - Mon Nov  9 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Then, I saw it the same. My dad soul is pure as one can get. I wonder what made him pick up the sword like that.... But yes, I hope I can make you bleed as well. - Mon Nov  9 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: For now, farewell. - Mon Nov  9 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Keep practicing. - Mon Nov  9 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Let's go again, sometime. Maybe keep training in the future. - Mon Nov  9 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So. - Mon Nov  9 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: What's with you? - Mon Nov  9 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) doesn't seem to be adressing anyone, but both of those observing might be willing to believe she is adressing them.

"And.. how long have you been there?" She inquires; as she swings her strange purple Nodachi downwards again, then steps forwards to turn it into a fluid thrust.* - Mon Nov  9 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well? - Mon Nov  9 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hello? - Mon Nov  9 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: -- Why are people gathering out here, anyway? - Mon Nov  9 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Isn't this secluded enough to do something in private? - Mon Nov  9 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) frowns, as she stabs her huge blade into the ground.

"Well?"* - Mon Nov  9 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) squints at the man as he walks away... then looks over towards the rocks.

"How about you?"* - Mon Nov  9 06:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: .. Guess it was just a sound.. - Mon Nov  9 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs, dismissing her weapon and walking away.* - Mon Nov  9 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Who is that? - Mon Nov  9 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks into the town circle, and sits down with her Katana in her lap, meditating placidly.* - Mon Nov  9 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles gently at the question, looking up with a quiet serenity about her as she does, arms crossed over her lap.

"Ah, hello. I am Mitsunara- and you are?" The young woman says- pale face creased with a gentle smile, and framed by purple hair.* - Mon Nov  9 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: -rid* not right- - Mon Nov  9 07:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) tilts her head to the side at his adress. She crooks an eyebrow as he starts to speak- but the first syllable and his subsequent reaction is more than enough. Her brow furrows as she rises to stand, sliding her blade to her hip.

"...What's wrong, Priest? Why must I move to your side, hrm?" She inquires calmly, face not betraying any emotions at all as she turns to face him.* - Mon Nov  9 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, a gentle smile on her face still resting.

"Ah, I see. I suppose some religous advice from a priest couldn't hurt, Mhrm." She agrees calmly, hands resting easily at her sides as she smiles at Lyan. "Your home, then? I'm homeless, after all."* - Mon Nov  9 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) calmly follows, hands at her sides.* - Mon Nov  9 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stares at him for a long moment, hands at her sides resting calmly.

She betrays no visible emotion, as she calmly nods.

"Yes, I suppose you would be able to tell that much, wouldn't you priest?" She says with a faint, almost playful smile. "So what do you mean to do about it, then..? Get me exiled? Kill me? Report me to the authorities..? Seal me, perhaps?" She says- her tone almost teasing.* - Mon Nov  9 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Tch.. - Mon Nov  9 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: I had meant to hide what I was as long as possible, too... - Mon Nov  9 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stares at her calmly- smiling faintly.

"My.. curses..?" She drawls out- chuckling faintly before shaking her head. "No, I wield no curses. I bear something else entirely." She explains calmly; flourishing her hand smoothly. She focuses intently; and it begins to form.

A blade of black purple; seeping darkness. If he is paying close extradimensional attention, it is formed out of her very soul- pulled free and shaped into a blade in her hand.

"I am no curse-bearer, I am a Deathbringer. I wield my soul as a weapon." She states calmly- staying absolutely serene.

"I don't know who this Susumu you spoke of is... but I assure you. My plan as it relates to Sunagakure is simple; to remain here and grow strong and train for as long as I can. I have no connections to my homeland- I severed such intentionally." She says firmly, blade held laxly- the Nodachi leaned against the ground in a non-threatening posture as she curls her lips disdainfully.

"My homelands attitude towards women secured that much."* - Mon Nov  9 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: What can I do? That is simple. - Mon Nov  9 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I am a Swordswoman who wields her soul. - Mon Nov  9 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: No more or less. - Mon Nov  9 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Good, lets keep it that way... im noting your abilities and I will keep an eye on you... Just dont cause trouble and we will be ok...  - Mon Nov  9 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Tch. - Mon Nov  9 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see. - Mon Nov  9 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: So your just a swordswoman who can manifest a weapon from your soul? - Mon Nov  9 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: If it eases your worries and fears, I've had a chance to kill at least three people with no witnesses, and took none of them. - Mon Nov  9 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? In effect, yes. - Mon Nov  9 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: For now. - Mon Nov  9 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I just leting you know I have eyes all around this village and you cant escape my eyes.... this is intended as a warning and a threat... I dont want to kill you without cause. Everyone, even if you are a necro, should have a chance to live - Mon Nov  9 07:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Is that what your Impotent God Preaches, or a personal decision? - Mon Nov  9 07:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: ... excuse me? - Mon Nov  9 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly, shrugging.

"Still. I suppose I'll accept your offer. I won't harm anyone of this village, and you won't kill me for existing." She says, faintly smiling as she has been this entire time- asi f nothing he's said has actually scared her. A mask, or..?* - Mon Nov  9 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: ... dont test me  - Mon Nov  9 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: If he kills me just over words, I've won, and he's just as bad as I am. - Mon Nov  9 08:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: You can go now... This was just a warning, I can at least give you that at least - Mon Nov  9 08:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: As you wish. - Mon Nov  9 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: My job never ends.... - Mon Nov  9 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Care to unlock the door for me, then? - Mon Nov  9 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) lets her weapon fade away into oblivion, giving him a courtly bow as she then turns to leave, chuckling softly.

"Fare thee well, Holy Priest."* - Mon Nov  9 08:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, Father Bryson- thanks for letting me know about and repairing that Cancer! - Mon Nov  9 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: See you around, eh? - Mon Nov  9 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Cancer. . ? - Mon Nov  9 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: ..... - Mon Nov  9 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Sure - Mon Nov  9 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) waves goodbye and chuckles.

"See you around."* - Mon Nov  9 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she skips away cheerfully.* - Mon Nov  9 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) hums cheerfully as she walks into the Konoha training field with a serene smile on her lips, looking around.

"Ah, hello." She says serenely to the two redheads standing there already.* - Mon Nov  9 08:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hi~ - Mon Nov  9 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) waves, smiling gently as she sways forwards.

"Ah... Mitsunara, at your service. A pleasure to meet you both... I don't suppose you're using the training field right now- or interested in using it?"* - Mon Nov  9 08:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah... so you're both busy, huh? - Mon Nov  9 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Im training currently - Mon Nov  9 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. and here I was, looking for a good fight...  - Mon Nov  9 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Sorry, I just wouldn't put up much of a fight currently. - Mon Nov  9 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Maybe later on though? - Mon Nov  9 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Well, if you'd like. - Mon Nov  9 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yea... Im not much of a figher... sorry - Mon Nov  9 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly- sighing as she looks on with a gentle smile.

"Mrm. I suppose I'll train over to the side. If you'd like, I can treat you both to a meal after we're all tired enough to head back from training? I don't have many freinds, and a chance to befreind such pleasant looking people isn't one I'd like to pass up."* - Mon Nov  9 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Like for example I cant use chakra nature transformation but I can use basic shinobi techniques like bushin and shushin - Mon Nov  9 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Mon Nov  9 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, I mean. I can't use any kind of nature transformation yet either. - Mon Nov  9 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: -omit- - Mon Nov  9 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'm just a Genin, after all. - Mon Nov  9 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Im a genin - Mon Nov  9 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: As am I. - Mon Nov  9 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: But I dont use my elemental nature... I dont need it - Mon Nov  9 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I believe everyone in the village is. - Mon Nov  9 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Sadly. - Mon Nov  9 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles calmly as she moves off to the side and draws the Katana at her hip; starting to flow slowly through basic forms and stances.

"I suppose that's true, yes." She says warmly as she starts to flow slowly and firmly.* - Mon Nov  9 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: And your Mitsunara? - Mon Nov  9 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mhrm, yes. That is my name. - Mon Nov  9 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hi, I'm Akira. - Mon Nov  9 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Nice to meetcha! - Mon Nov  9 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Im Rias, like to meet you - Mon Nov  9 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I can't do much so you're both better than me, Heh. - Mon Nov  9 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: No way of knowing whose better until you test it, y'know? Still- that's your decision. - Mon Nov  9 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I guess, Fair point. - Mon Nov  9 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Im a special fighter... so I can fight how you want - Mon Nov  9 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Special..? - Mon Nov  9 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yea, I om not a taijutsu user or ninjutsu user - Mon Nov  9 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Interesting... are you sure you wouldn't be interested in a spar? - Mon Nov  9 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I mean... what do you use? - Mon Nov  9 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Hm, Not Tai or Nin...could be Genjutsu she uses. I doubt it would be Fuuinjutsu like me. - Mon Nov  9 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Just simple Kenjutsu. - Mon Nov  9 08:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Sounds a little risky Rias. - Mon Nov  9 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If you get sliced up...well we don't have many doctors in the village... - Mon Nov  9 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: See... I cant match that... it would be over rather quickly unless you stll want to try... - Mon Nov  9 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh. Easy for which of us, hrm? - Mon Nov  9 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well I guess we can give it ago... - Mon Nov  9 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: This is a bad idea... - Mon Nov  9 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) calmly nods as her foe speaks, bowing her head respectfully, then drawing her Katana.

"Mrm. Very well. Who shall open?" She inquires calmly.* - Mon Nov  9 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Uh, Sword lady. - Mon Nov  9 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't doubt your skill with a blade but. - Mon Nov  9 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Please don't inflict any deep cuts. - Mon Nov  9 08:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: We have nearly no medics in the village. - Mon Nov  9 08:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, smiling. She's an elegant and lithe figure in a flowing red robe that has noticeably recently repaired stiching in the back, but is otherwise mostly immaculate. Her blade seems to be simple Iron, and she smiles serenely as her foe begins to form handseals. She is somewhat cautious- but she still chooses to step in and sweep with her blade for her foes side- a stroke for the stomach delivered two handed as she steps behind it.

"Show me what you are capable of."* - Mon Nov  9 08:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) blinks at her foe seemingly being much closer. It cannot be real- but at the same time, she is forced to believe it's real; she has no knowledge or skill with Genjutsu.

So she steps through and thrusts her blade on through where she believes her foe is. Though if Rias gets too close, she will still be in danger due to the sweep of the steel being broad, she is not being targeted properly due to the Genjutsu's effects.

The two shuriken both impact, and...

Bounce off of her body. They do absolutely nothing.* - Mon Nov  9 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) blinks, as she snaps out of the Genjutsu and frowns; holding her blade in both hands... she nods slowly, lowering her blade and frowning as she does.

"...How bizzare. Genjutsu, huh..? Fascinating." She muses idly... as she smiles gently. "Then I suppose this sparring match is over. Thank you- I've learned of something I must prepare to defend myself against. I think in a real fight, if you wheren't alone, you could certainly defeat me with such- defeat me like that, then have a freind slit my throat." She praises- and as she does, her blade snaps back up with no warning.

It's a sudden and brutal action, as she moves to cut off one of the womans hands- striking for her left arm with a sudden and brutal speed as she smiles serenely. "I wonder what you'll do to my soul." She inquires idly after the stroke has already either connected or missed, as she steps in closer for a headbutt in the same motion to discorient the girl. It's sudden, abrupt, and absolutely brutal- as she strikes out with sudden strength and killing intent.* - Mon Nov  9 09:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) blinks, as she snaps out of repeating a loop of her initial strike again and staggers uncertainly, her hands completing the movements- and then she realizes she never.. actually.

She looks confused- then nods slowly, rubbing her forehead as she sheathes her weapon.

"I.. I see... Genjutsu, then.." She murmurs softly- nodding slightly as she frowns for a brief moment- before smiling broadly at the girl as she walks away.

"I may be physically stronger- but with any support, those kind of techniques could spell my end while you held me with them. Genjutsu is an impressive skillset." She admits calmly- allowing her to walk away as she strokes her chin.

"So- how about that meal I offered? I'll pay."* - Mon Nov  9 09:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and nods, leaning back.and running a hand through her hair.

"I suppose I understand. I wish the both of you well." She offers politely, as she then turns to walk away, humming gently. "...Ah, and I spent all my money on the Caravan to come here anyway... Can't buy another one back.." She muses, chuckling faintly.

"I suppose I'll be here a little while, while I work on that. See you around, yeah?"* - Mon Nov  9 10:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes bye~ - Mon Nov  9 10:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Such a nice girl - Mon Nov  9 10:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: So...walk me home? - Mon Nov  9 10:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Oh, hey. G'night. - Mon Nov  9 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Oh, Hey there. - Mon Nov  9 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm heading off to bed myself. - Mon Nov  9 10:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) waves. She seems to be aimlessly wandering the streets.

"Ah. I see! I'm... realizing I spent too much money on the Caravan here, to pay for one back home to Suna.." She admits, sheepishly rubbing the back of her head.* - Mon Nov  9 10:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm? A caravan? - Mon Nov  9 10:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I got you. - Mon Nov  9 10:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Oh, please- I don't want to be a burden! - Mon Nov  9 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) accepts the wad, but blushes with embarassment.

"Ah.. thank you. Now, you shouldn't keep your girl waiting!"* - Mon Nov  9 10:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Sure she wasn't. - Mon Nov  9 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Now go tap that, eh? - Mon Nov  9 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) waves goodbye and struts away.* - Mon Nov  9 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) disembarks from the Konoha caravan feeling moderately peckish, and yawns.* - Mon Nov  9 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks back into the square, yawning as she stretches out.

"Mrm..."* - Mon Nov  9 10:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Give it a shot. .  - Mon Nov  9 10:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Oh... she is back... I wonder where she has been? - Mon Nov  9 10:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) looks around, yawning as she does. She looks the same as always- though she's had the cuts in her clothes stitched up at some point as she looks around, hands in her pockets.* - Mon Nov  9 10:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. is anyone using the Arena, do you guys know - Mon Nov  9 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's clear. - Mon Nov  9 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Cool... boring to not have anyone there to spar, but cool for some privacy, for once. - Mon Nov  9 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, and turns to walk away.

"Thanks."* - Mon Nov  9 10:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks out into the training Arena- and looks around several times to check and make sure she is alone.

"... even if it is.. yes, I still need to practice this.." She murmurs aloud softly; as she takes a firm posture. She holds both hands out- and breathes in to focus, hoping no one is nearby. And then she steps forward, and forms a blade in her hands.

It's a gleaming purple weapon; no sound is made, no Jutsu called out.. merely action. Those outside the Arena cannot see what she is doing, most likely; as she forms a blade- presumably out of chakra- that she holds in a two handed grip.

"...Mrm.." She murmurs; before stepping forwards to make a sweeping stroke with the blade, which she turns into a thrust halfway through.* - Mon Nov  9 10:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly as she holds the purple Nodachi in both hands- flowing through her forms with the weapon to keep them sharp despite her use of a more normal Katana in most spars.

She flows and dances through the sand of the Arena with the blade of her soul in hand, making deft and fluid strokes through the air as she does; humming with a quiet serenity.* - Mon Nov  9 10:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) pauses in the midst of an elongated stroke. By this point, a sheathe that trails purple darkness has appeared at her side- a fine scabbard worked and inlaid with that dark purple light.

The blade is long- a full Nodachi, wielded much like a Katana for some reason. She pauses- and slowly turns to look at him, as she lowers the blade- still holding it by the black grip.

"Hrm..? You flatter me, sir- I am no Samurai, I assure you." She says softly- a gentle smile on her eyes, and her eyes cold and analytical above anything else.* - Mon Nov  9 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at his comment, shaking her head.

Something else he might notice about that Nodachi, being a Blacksmith? It's made of no metal he's ever seen. It's purple- the actual, steel of the blade, is purple.

"...No, merely a genin who has focused greatly on her swordplay." She says- bowing her head slightly. "You flatter me- but you declare my swordsmanship above it's true value."* - Mon Nov  9 11:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at his question, holding the Nodachi to her side with a faint smile as she looks at him.

"Where did I get it..? Well, I suppose that's a secret, Mrm?" She says in an almost teasing tone, before looking down as her stomach audibly rumbles. "One I might share in exchange for a good meal, Hrm?" She muses aloud, before shrugging.

"Regardless. My talent may be great for my experience- but it is.. insufficient. I am no Chuunin, not even close. Still- I thank you for your kind words."* - Mon Nov  9 11:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she turns to walk away... and the next time he blinks, there is no Nodachi in her hand, or sheathe for one at her hip; just the old Iron Katana that was there the whole time.... and purple smoke fading on the wind as she leads the way to a resturant.

"As you like."* - Mon Nov  9 11:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) leads the way into a relatively small resturant, and settles back into the seat with a playful smile as she looks at the man across the table, stretching out and yawning.

"Welcome to the Hungry Ant."* - Mon Nov  9 11:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, leaning back against the chair with a lazy smile, elbows on the table as well.

"Mrm. Names Mitsunara." She offers in reply, lifting her left hand up to shake. "So- you have questions? I'll answer them over a meal, I'm starving."* - Mon Nov  9 11:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) looks over the Menu as he speaks, nodding slowly. As the Waiter begins to walk away-  she's already speaking.

"Roast Chicken with Noodles." She orders calmly before the waiters are even gone, smiling as she hands in her Menu, before looking back to her companion and chuckles.

"I'm Seventeen... and if you mean how long I've been a Shinobi? A few months." She says calmly as she leans back. "Nearly a year, at this point." She muses idly- shrugging. "How about you- what business /are/ you in?"* - Mon Nov  9 11:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, stroking her chin.

"I see... Hrm. I wonder if you could forge armor light enough to wear under a robe that was strong enough for someone of my endurance to consider worth wearing.. heh. I've been told my skin is like Iron, you know." She muses cheerily- before shrugging. "Anyway- I see! A craftsman, huh? I suppose that explains your interest in my blade, Hrm?"* - Mon Nov  9 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh. - Mon Nov  9 11:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Interesting. We'll have to test that some time, I think- especially if you don't seem to believe me! - Mon Nov  9 11:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins almost fiercely; eyes beaming with a certain kind of pride as she speaks, chuckling softly.

"Anyway.... I don't really have much money, admitably- so that kind of thing is mostly theoretical as far as I am concerned. Still.. an interesting thought." She muses- before shrugging.

"So. You wanted to know about the sword, eh? I'll begin with this. You will never be able to forge anything like it."* - Mon Nov  9 11:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly, waiting for the woman to leave- then answers very, very bluntly.

"You would never be able to wield or replicate it.. because it is formed of my soul, drawn out by a special technique of my clan." She explains calmly. "You are free to examine it- but it is not replicatable, nor could any hands but mine wield it." She explains calmly- a gentle smile still on her lips.* - Mon Nov  9 11:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at his scepticism; seeming visibly amused by his attitude towards her claims- as she nods serenely.

"Yes. The blade is literally my very soul, I assure you of that." She says calmly, nodding her head. "It is linked to an ability of my clan, the Akimora, and I do not believe those not of my blood could use such an ability- I've never seen or heard of anything else even truly similar... as for the later- I believe so."* - Mon Nov  9 12:04:03 2015
