<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles faintly at her own jokes as they walk in-then sighs and smiles as she just lets it all go, stretching as they enter.

"So... is this going to be more threats and cajolement towards me for... mocking words? Or just a general checkup to make sure I've not set a toe out of line? DOn't worry- apart from being a smartass, I've been a godamn model citizen."* - Wed Nov 11 09:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow at him, hands still in her pockets.

".. You brought me into your house. To preach at me? Wow, what?" She says- crooking an eyebrow up. "What, you want me to stop practicing the dark arts and being an inhuman monster by nature, or grow a heart and start giving a shit? Which impossibility'll it be, darlin?" * - Wed Nov 11 09:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stands there with a lax smile on her face, and her hands in her pockets- then shakes her head, calmly.

"I may not give a damn about Huevo Diablo's cause. I may not ever want to actually advance the cause of the land of my birth- or particularly care for any of it..." She trails of, smiling faintly. 

"I may love Sunagakure, my real home. I may want to understand emotions better- to feel love, to understand kindness, to comprehend and have a real relationship.." She trails of again, her smile slipping into a sneer.

"But I assure you. I'm not even fully human- though admitably, I suppose you aren't either. And while neither of us may have had a choice in our lifestyles, in our beliefs..?" She laughs, shaking her head.

"I enjoy my life, my beliefs, as much as you cleave to yours, darlin. I like wielding the dark arts. It's what I know- it comes as natural to me as breathing. I like it. I love it- I want some more of it! Understand." She shakes her head.

"I may sometimes wish I understood all those things- but that doesn't change that I can't. I'm not /quite/ what most folk would call a Sociopath- I feel enough to have some emotions, and to regret the ones I lack... but I'm close enough to enjoy taking a life, even if I logically understand why I shouldn't. I may be loyal to this village. I may be, above all, a pragmatist.." She chuckles and grins wide t him, as she takes a step forwards.

"But I sure do love the feeling of cutting someone down, and drinking down their soul. If you want to kill me, instead of letting me live like that- THEN GO THE FUCK AHEAD!" She roars- suddenly exploding in volume as her eyes seem to burn. It's unclear where all of this is coming from, this tirade of a response to his suggestion- but her eyes are aflame.

"Because I'll never turn back from this road I'm on. I'll never stop walking the high road into hell- cutting down whatever's in my way. So darlin- if you can't stand that, if you want to 'save' me, to save a monster from bein a monster- it'll come to killing- and I won't die without a fight."

"Kiyoko, you gonna be okay? Can you hitch a ride back to the hospital from soeone else later, cus I really need to go to sleep.. .Hrm? Yeah, night. Good luck in the library, Rias."* - Wed Nov 11 10:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) hums as she walks into Yans house- and begins to practice.

She forms her Soul-Sword, and makes a deft stroke through the air- sideways and horizontal as she steps into it, then steps back to pull it inwards to her body, before stepping forwards to lunge.

"Sharper by the day... Yeah.. I just need to keep feeding you.. and killin my heart with you... isn't that right..?" She muses softly to her sword, as she flows through the air with it- only to dismiss it at the end of a Kata..* - Wed Nov 11 10:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly, as she summons it forth again mere seconds later; smoke that was just furling away reforming, pulled back from the Abyss just as she was letting go and fully forming into her Nodachi as she resumes her Kata.

"..Yeah. I gotta hurry.. it hurts too much to keep seeing all these people.. with such relationships...." She whispers softly, as she continues to flow through another Kata- and once more ends with dismissing the sword..* - Wed Nov 11 10:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) heaves a deep breath- as yet again, she pulls it back into her hands with a surge of energy that is, perhaps suprising to those that know the laid back, casual woman.

This is who she really is- a woman determined to cut her heart to ribbons with her own soul, so that she doesn't have to feel the pain of watching others have what she earnestly believes she can't.

She dances through the steps in her freinds house- carefully keeping the sharp blade away from damaging anything, except what she is holding in her hands.

And again- for the finish she dismisses it.* - Wed Nov 11 10:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... Perhaps that's enough, for tonight. - Wed Nov 11 10:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) curls up on the pillows in Yan's house, and sighs- before passing out entirely.* - Wed Nov 11 10:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out and yawns as she walks up, smiling placidly and looking around. She turns and waves to Kiyoko.

"Y'hear that, Priest...? You'll not be gettin in my freind's way, yeah..?" She says with a lazy smile- thinking idly to herself..

'Freind.. I like the sound of that..' Even as her mind is idly distracted by the mentioning of a necromantic sword... How unusual.* - Thu Nov 12 02:40:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stares at Lyan... and tilts her head to the side.

"...Priest. Boy. You need to calm the hell down. She's trying to help someone who has anger issues- not selling her soul. I'm not even going with her- just stopping you from ruling her life." She states calmly- staring into the priests light with no hesitation- as her body seems to visibly heat from what he's doing...

And yet she endures with no comment, despite the burning- as she stands between the man and the girl- crooking an eyebrow as the priest calls out what she is in public, in broad daylight.

"You need to relax. And not be a control freak. Her life is hers- not yours, not mine. I for one..? Ironically, haven't influenced her a whit. She just wants to help a poor guy, who has some serious issues, get over them and stop hurting people. And you, as a priest, are against that..? Really..? You're against her helping someone..? I'm kind of amused by the hypocrisy, priest. She'll become evil by helping a man who has problems..? What idiocy. That kind of self sacrificing rot is what your kind usually preaches, isn't it...? So stop trying to deign who she can help, and get out of her way. I don't give a damn about our agreement-.... I don't have enough freinds to throw one under the stampede just because you're the one who has a problem with what she's doing." She rants at him- intent on doing something simple.

Monolouging and distracting him long enough for Aza and Kiyoko to get away- as she clenches her fists.* - Thu Nov 12 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And sure, dude. Just let me finish up here. - Thu Nov 12 03:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stares at Bryson as he moves- and stares at him.

"Anarchist..? No. I am a very law abiding citizen. I care about rules, regulations- I just don't agree with yours. Because I'm against you, I'm against order and law..? No. Heretic? Yes. Anarchist..? No. He may very well be a berserking brute- and that's exactly why she wants to help him- so that he can /stop/ being a berserking brute, so that she can /heal/ that part of him." She explains calmly, patiently- staring into Bryson's eyes.

"Now. Let's calm down here, and stop calling compassion, a sickness." She says calmly- before craning her head to look past Bryson, and wave at the man in the green jumpsuit.

"So, with that taken care of, and those two safely at the hospital... you still up for that spar, yo?" * - Thu Nov 12 03:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) turns and smiles gratefully to Izutora- just glad that ended without violence as she holds out a hand in a traditional fistbump position.

"So, names Mitsunara. How about that spar, Youthful guy?"* - Thu Nov 12 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins lazily and nods, chuckling as she tucks her hands into her robes pockets.

"Right. So how about we head out to the training field, yeah? I don't have my usual weapon, but that won't really be a problem.. probably. Yeah?"* - Thu Nov 12 03:36:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods and chuckles- jogging off to the Arena with a faint smile on her face.

"Heh... let's see how good you are in a fight, eh..? I've been training pretty hard lately, but I'll have a handicap.. so we'll see!" She says- a certain joy in her tone as she pushes away the stress of the day, and prepares to lose herself in a fight.* - Thu Nov 12 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So..... Mrm. - Thu Nov 12 03:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Decide that after you see how I take a held back punch, yeah? - Thu Nov 12 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Feel free to use as much strength as you decide you need to, after the first round. - Thu Nov 12 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah? - Thu Nov 12 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Alright! - Thu Nov 12 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) cracks her shoulders- and grins fiercely as she takes a Kendo stance- but she seems to be unarmed. She holds that stance with a faint smile on her lips- a gleam in her eyes.

"Make your own judgements." She says simply- as she lowers herself down to ready for his actionse.* - Thu Nov 12 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) doesn't seem to pay attention to the Kunai- because paying attention to projectiles isn't her usual style- as she tenses low with a broad grin on her lips at his rushing  charge.

"A'right then." She says lazily- as she tenses for the blow... and his leg lands on her chest with no attempt to dodge on her part... as her hands lunge. One grabs the leg a second after it makes contact, holding it there- as her other snaps out to deliver a vicous- but slower- hook to his chin as she holds him there.

"Not bad!" She grins as she grunts out- not even given pause by his restrained attack as she steps forth into it while grabbing him- pulling him by his leg into her punch as she throws her weight behind it with a gleam in her eyes of...

Joy? As she realizes rapidly. If he threw that Kunai... Yes. This'll be fun.

She might actually get right back into the hospital, just after getting out!* - Thu Nov 12 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts at that. She takes the hit to the stomach- and endures with her grip- tightening it in pain at first... as rather than let go... she twists her entire body, as the blow makes her almost want to puke from sheer force to the stomach- as she twists- and throws him with all her might towards the wall, rather than putting him down- swaying back as she makes the Discus-like toss of his body.

"God.. damnit... that's..." She coughs and grimaces as she draws herself back up into her stance.

"... I can't risk using my sword, even, that much force would shatter it... damnit, this is.." She grimaces- as she then steels herself to resume her stance- as he's in the air flying away, most likely, unless he decided to latch on.

At the very least, he's out of range to perform that move /this/ moment, as she raises her fists back up- staring at him.

"..I can already tell.. you're a lot stronger 'n me... Damn. First person to be.... Tch." She coughs and sways again- her stomach in a lot of pain from that blow- but not enough to slow down someone like her as she keeps her eyes on where she threw him.. or tried to.* - Thu Nov 12 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) takes a deep breath and chuckles... then takes a deep breath, and nods.

"....Don't worry. I'm not holding back- not for long anyway. C'mon... Let's keep going!" She says with a grin- but she also seems to refuse to take the bait- as she solidifies her stance, and holds her hands together near her waist- but it's confusing.

There's no sword in the sheathe at her hip- none of any kind, as she focuses intently- then breathes out, and in. Out.. and in.

Her eyes gleam faintly.

"Come on! I'm ready!"* - Thu Nov 12 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) does something that it is almost certain he didn't expect. It begins forming as soon as he charges- but there's little time. She steps backwards, and sweeps her hands with nothing in them...

And as she does; something forms. Blackness and purple energy form- and his charge is met by a slash to his midsection- before he could reach her, due to the length of just what formed.

A Nodachi is formed to meet his charge in her hands- gleaming purple and wicked sharp as it cuts through the air- a grin on her lips as she hopes to at least slow his charge before being hit in the face- even as she lowers her head into this- likely taking a fore-leg to the forehead, rather than a kick straight to the chin..

Unless, of course, he can react quick enough to recover his move with a sword suddenly blurring out of thin air at him..!* - Thu Nov 12 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) thinks: That was close! It almost ripped the stitches! - Thu Nov 12 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces as his blow indeed forces her upwards- the blow reacting incredibly fast. He's- sadly for her- insanely faster than her. She's strong- she's tough. But she's far from quick- then again, she's not been at this too long.

She grimaces as she goes airborne- and twists the Nodachi in her grip, as her feet leave the ground- holding it still in both hands, as she raises it up above her head.

"G.. gyah...." She grunts out- pain surging through her body from the blow to her chin- almost breaking her jaw.. though thankfully, not damaging her ribs any, as she is lifted into the air.. .and curls up into a ball, tucking her legs in, as she raises her Katana up, and tucks her head in- apparently reacting with the simple intent of minimizing the damage she can take while airborne as best she can.* - Thu Nov 12 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) slams into the ground at full speed- throwing sand up in a wave as she feels something creak in her legs... a pain in her entire body- spread out, mitigating the strain on any one area... but at the same time- it hurts a /lot/ as she impacts the sand, blade in hand...as she splays out from the ball into a low crouch, blade held low. She looks up as he too, is of course falling from the air after delivering the attack and catching a moment of hangtime from slapping her back.

She thrusts upwards with her full strength, like an uppercut into a punch- but with a thrust from a Nodachi.

She aims to intersect his fall with a thrust to the chest, her entire body behind it as she snaps up- a gleam in the brutish womans eyes.

He can tell- by this point. She's taking far more damage than she's letting on- and pushing through the pain with a monstrous strength- almost inhuman in nature as she thrusts a full force strike for his gut- a gleam in her eyes...

As instead of a scream, her lips let loose a laugh of glee as she throws herself behind the blow.

"WAAHOO!"* - Thu Nov 12 04:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) twists as his foot makes contact and pushes of the side of hte Nodachi, grimacing. Her own feet briefly leave the ground as she twists through the air to keep her eyes on him- a grin on her face. He arcs through the air and lands- as she twists and lands as well- facing him with her Nodachi held two handed as she steels her stance.

"..Heh.... I think if we go on much longer... one of us is going to get badly hurt- probably me.... Tch. I think there's no shame in saying it.. .you win. I need more training to fight someone 's strong as this.."* - Thu Nov 12 04:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I'll keep his attention by being big and dangerous, and you run around and deal damage when you can. Solid? - Thu Nov 12 05:15:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You ready for us? - Thu Nov 12 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins, as she flourishes her Nodachi to the side as she turns to face Yan once more. She takes the blade into a two handed grip- taking leisurely steps towards him as she readies herself, standing firm as she whips it to the side.

"Because we're ready when you are, right Hiroshi?" She says with a fierce grin- the purple blade gleaming darkly in her hands....* - Thu Nov 12 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) meanwhile, is leaning into her foot- focusing on where she saw him. She pays no mind to the clone techniques- knowing that while he has several... logically, clone techniques can't produce clones at a range from the target- and are both draining, and weakened from the original.

She has no idea that they aren't real- but she has no respect for them, as she lunges to raise her blade- and sweep it for Yan's gut in a fairly straight forward and brutal opener as she launches forwards- a grin on her lips.

"Let's dance!" She says with a laugh- her eyes on her foes face as she watches to see how he reacts.

Her weapon is coming in fast for his side as she steps into the blow- grinning wide as she roars out.

"Fake's won't help you- only the real deal will be able to hurt /me/!" She boasts- hoping that she's right as the blade comes ripping through the air towards her foe.* - Thu Nov 12 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) twists to grind her blade against him- but his armor protects him fully; the dark edge of her soul grinding against his body- no.

That's when she realizes it. The blade isn't grinding against his body- it's grinding against his armor. She hears the sound of metal on metal- she see's the sparks... and that's when she grimaces and tenses her body.

His hands begin to move- and she tenses to use her blade against his side as a lever. She throws herself to the side, as the mod sprays out. As it is- she's caught halfway by the Jutsu, and forced backwards as she steels herself to stay standing against the tide, bringing her blade down and to the side- skidding through the sand as she is forced back by the wave of mud.

"...This.. technique... is so gross." The woman protests with a grimace- brought to a crouch, but not made to fall as she leans her blade into the sand- a cloud kicked up by the blade dragging against the ground.

"...Tch."* - Thu Nov 12 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ^^^^ - Thu Nov 12 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as the trick is pulled. As her foe dissapears from sight, she tries to figure out what he's doing- and then he's ripping Hiroshi down into the ground. The earth swallows her ally, and she leaps forwards- hands on her blade.

A Nodachi is a long, long weapon- basically a much longer Katana... and she seems to use it almost naturally as she holds it low to the side while stepping in- then thrusts it for his armpit- trying to lunge at a seam in the armor, if there is one, as she also is moving at the same time to cover Hiroshi- so that she is standing next to his head, able to intercept most kinds of attacks that would be aimed at him due to proximity.

"Not bad.... Heh. NIce trick!" She booms out as she lunges from the extent of her blades reach.* - Thu Nov 12 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ..You utter troll. - Thu Nov 12 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) keeps moving once the sword makes contact, however- with it skidding across his arm plate, she pulls it out to the side and upwards, as she continues to run closer, and as he starts to form another seal...

She brings it back down- transitioning from a failed stab, to an upward swing- pulling the blade out to the side and up as she steps in close- a grin on her lips.

Her hands, high and guiding the blade at an odd angle, held low to her side as her body is slanted sideways to face him- that grin on her face.

"HIYAA!" She cries- as she brings the blade down on his shoulder while stepping in- the tip far behind her foe, his body beneath the middle of the blade...

As the blade.. expands. Swelling with chakra and energy- it expands. For a brief moment, there is a barely visible hallucination of a figure jumping down on the blade to push it downwards onto Yan's shoulder- a figure that Yan likely recognizes from the execution that Mitsunara performed on the Kazekage's orders... dragging the now massively enlarged blade down towards his shoulder as she steps in to finish the strike.

"Hiroshi, get your ass outa the ground!"* - Thu Nov 12 07:15:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts as the Jutsu takes her full force- soaking through her leather coat. It's blunt trauma to the upper chest- and it hurts. It's like a solid blow to the body- and she grunts out as it's delivered- skidding to the side, then pitching herself to chase him- that long blade shrinking back down as the spectre that briefly empowered it fades away- as she twists the blade to follow him with the edge, throwing herself towards and to the side as she shrugs through the pain of the water gun.

She stands her ground against comparable damage all the time, after all- as her blade follows him with intent to slam into his side from the extent of his reach- aiming for one of his arms to try and disrupt his handseals- a gleam in her eyes as she laughs aloud.

"Damn, that actually kinda hurt!" She booms out as she chases him with a growing grin.

"This.. is really damn.. FUN!"* - Thu Nov 12 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces as the water attack pushes against her- holding her ground as usual as her slice finally ends, whipping out to her side as she holds it against the ground- tip resting in the sand as she grimaces- the water striking hard into her stomach this time as she coughs from the impact.

"Ugh... not bad, not bad at all.... Hiroshi. Get his ass down from there." She says calmly- as she starts to walk towards the wall...

Slowly... as the water drips down her frame, plastering her clothes to her voloptous figure as she walks along- she's uncannilly curvacous for someone generally so brutish and resselient.

And she does /not/ look pleased.* - Thu Nov 12 08:03:50 2015

"... I really need to learn Suimen or something, so I can start chasing people up walls. I don't really have a way up there." She admits.* - Thu Nov 12 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs, looking down at her outfit as she dismisses her blade into purple smoke.

"Ugh... I'm going to have to get a change of outfit myself, too.." She muses, before chuckling and shrugging.

"Ah, well.."* - Thu Nov 12 08:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: By sir~ - Thu Nov 12 08:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks into the house- and feels a disturbance in the force. She slowly looks around, yawning and stretching out.

"I'm getting changed in the bathroom. Just a mo." She says calmly- before heading out back.* - Thu Nov 12 08:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) heads back out a short while, changed into a dry version of her usual outfit.

"Hrm..? A bit, yeah. Some food would be cool." She agrees calmly- chuckling faintly as she does. "So... how was your day?"* - Thu Nov 12 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out as she walks up and yawns, sighing.

"Well, I... mostly worked out and took it easy, to be honest. I was letting my ribs finish up healing.. though I think earlier confirms they are aboutt good on that front, heh.." She trails of and sighs.

"Mrm.... so, same old same old." She says, chuckling faintly. "Well... as you saw, I got a new technique figured out, too.."* - Thu Nov 12 08:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow as she shifts to sit across the table from him- smiling faintly.

"What's wrong? It's just a technique to make the sword bigger." She says calmly- unervingly calm, considering the topic at hand, as she bows her head and speaks softly.

"..Also- seriously. Thanks for helping me out n' letting me stay here." She says softly- offering thanks before starting in on the meal.* - Thu Nov 12 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at that, and shrugs.

"Still, I gotta pay you back eventually. You've been good to me- and we both know you had no obligation to do so.. and every reason not to. With that in mind.. I owe you one." She says simply- even as she is stuffing her face with the food from her plate.* - Thu Nov 12 08:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly at the request.

"Yeah, sure." She says calmly, yawning as she leans back. "Mrm.... enjoy the shower, I guess." She says softly, as she looks around for the papers and such to get started, cracking her knuckles.* - Thu Nov 12 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: I need to practice that sword expansion technique.. shit is draining, I need to get a hang of making that particular soul my bitch. - Thu Nov 12 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) hums calmly. 

Yan walks back into the room to find a small set lined up- rolled suprisingly neatly and orderly for the woman in question. Guess she's less crazy 'n she seems- or just more ordered in mind.

"So... sup?"* - Thu Nov 12 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Spark it up... - Thu Nov 12 09:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm glad I took the shower, I feel great now... - Thu Nov 12 09:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.... Aight... - Thu Nov 12 09:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) yawns and just... passes out there, slumping against the pillows- leaving Yan with the rolled joints, as she curls up into a ball and snores.* - Thu Nov 12 09:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) yawns as she stirs from her sleep to look around. She walks out to the corner of Yan's house as she does- preparing herself to train for a while.

"Right.. new technique. Gotta get it down.." She murmurs drowsily.as she focuses intently- forming her sword in her hands with a focused moment of thought...

Then lifting it and stepping forwards- expanding it as she steps forward and swings down, calling forth Yuudai's soul to empower her blade as she steps forward- and grunts.

"...Fully assimilated, but even so.. a draining technique."* - Thu Nov 12 20:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) takes a low breath- lifting her blade into the air slowly as it shrinks back down- then once more, expanding it as she swings down-  grunting as the blade hits the earth.

"Phew... hits hard, though.." She murmurs- chuckling as she lands the blow to the ground and chuckling.

She lifts the sword slowly up, letting it shrink again and Yuudai's soul recede as she does.

".. I suppose that's enough for now." She murmurs softly.* - Thu Nov 12 20:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) scratches her head, yawning as she walks up.

"Mrm..?"* - Thu Nov 12 21:02:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) salutes before turning to walk towards the square, humming.* - Thu Nov 12 21:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Should I be offended by being called, "redhead"? - Thu Nov 12 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, turning to head to the Arena.

"What's your name, yo?"* - Thu Nov 12 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Mana, you? - Thu Nov 12 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mitsunara. - Thu Nov 12 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh... - Thu Nov 12 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So, you want the first move, or shall I? - Thu Nov 12 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I'll roll for us. This is a normal die. Evens you go, odds I do, okay? - Thu Nov 12 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Sure, I guess. I don't much care. - Thu Nov 12 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Looks like it's you. - Thu Nov 12 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles- briefly limbering up before she crouches low- and starts to run forwards, hands at her side as she takes off.

She isn't quite fast enough to reach the woman yet, though- as she comes close, hands low and to her sides- obviously readying for something.. though what isn't clear.* - Thu Nov 12 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly. She grins... as she crouches to take the hit to her face- and her chin slightly turns- tilted to the side by the impact..... but on a closer look...

Not damaged even slightly. Her cheek only moves because she intentionally rotates her face with it- taking the hit full force to the face without flinching as she snaps up from the crouch- her right hand snapping to grab her opponent by the kicking-leg...

As her left snaps out as she pulls the woman in closer, to deliver a vicous right hook to her opponents jawline just the same as she just took a kick to the jawline- a grin on her face as she does so.

"Not bad, kid! But I see that move all the time!" She says with a laugh.* - Thu Nov 12 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sways back, as the girl who drops to the ground seems to spring back up. A lazy grin on her face as she steps back and prepares for the other girls response- and then she speaks calmly.

"So I don't have to hold back, then..? That's good." Is her calm response to the woman enduring her restrained blow, as she slides one foot back, and puts the other forwards. It's unclear what she's doing...

And then she watches as Mana throws herself at her for a combo. The first kick lands on her hips, having no visible effect- and as the other woman is spinning up to finish the combo...

A knee comes crashing up into her center of mass as she springs up full body out of the crouch to deliver it- intent on knocking Mana out of the air and interupting the combo- launched a moment after the first kick connects, and likely as the second strike also lands- not fazing the woman at all...

As she throws herself up into it, arms to either side crashing in as simple swings to the other womans arms.

"HAHAHAAAA!"* - Thu Nov 12 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) steps to the side- grunting quietly. She's smiling laxly- and makes idle suggestions as she twists to the side and leaps backwards.

"So, let's be clear here. You can't hurt me head on- so aim for my throat, or my face, to set me offguard. Maybe try using gravity or something. I'm tough- but I promise, I'm not invulnerable- YET!" She says with a boisterous laugh. She just steps back as the other woman seems to try and sidestep her.

"So come on. Show me more, if you have more- I won't draw my sword, so don't worry."* - Thu Nov 12 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as her foe steps back in- a gleam in her eyes as she does. She tenses and moves in- as her foe steps forwards. As her foe grabs her right arms clothing, her left snaps out to slam into her foes gut.

It's a heavy blow- but it doesn't do anything to stop the grapple coming for her. The grab hefts her- and lifts her up, before throwing her to the ground. She grunts- confused as the blow lands into her shoulder. She lands facedown in the sand, but soon rolls to the side and springs back up- her right arm hanging limp.

"Eh..? I see... an attack that targets joints and pressure points to temporarily disable a limb, huh..? Impressive. I don't suppose you'd be willing to show me how to do a few of those tricks, after this, eh? I'm short on fancy moves- I'm all POWER!" She says with a grin...

As she plants her left hand on the ground, and pushes herself up for a full body kick to her foe from where she landed..!* - Thu Nov 12 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) blinks- as her full body kick is diverted while she's still mostly sideways- then the girl lunges in while she's being diverted- and snaps a blow to her throat.

It doesn't hurt- not really.. but her Adams apple bobs, and she coughs briefly- caught offguard by the combo. Her right arm continues to hang limp at her side, as her left springs of the ground to rotate her in midair...

As the kick lands on her body and sends her up- as the other kick lands on her body as well- forcing her back down.. as she slams her legs back down so they hit the ground first- landing on her feet, as she sways slightly, left hand raising up as she staggers back- grinning.

"Now you're gettin it." She says agreeably, grinning wide.

There's a slight bruise on her throat- and her right arm still hangs useless at her side. Though... she is already starting to regain some sensation in it.* - Thu Nov 12 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) tenses, grinning wide as she lowers her stance and grins at Mana, hands to her sides- no blade drawn, just her fists... and nods.

"Cautioun, huh..? Let's see how well it serves you!" She says with a grin- her right arm still limp as, even though she's slowly regaining use of it, she decides to give no sign that such is happening..

As she steps in and throws a rather simple left jab for her foes gut- a feint, however, as it intentionally misses just slightly, before she steps in to deliver a headbut- forehead to forehead, she slams in for that kind of blow as the arm that just feinted past her foes body curls around to pull her in for a one-armed bear hug..!* - Thu Nov 12 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) laughs aloud- a wild grin on her face as her foe focuses- and unleashes something. She's no sensor- not at all. But at the same time...she can tell when something is different- she's seen this before. Kurt did it.. yeah. She nods- and cheerfully goes through with her attack..

As the two blows land against each other full force- a shockwave from meeting headbuts...

And she sways back, her hold breaking as she coughs and grins- her head knocked back.. blood trickling from her forhead.

A single drop hits the sands- as she sways back. She looks like she finally took a serious hit- as her head slowly cranes back into place- and her grin is wider than ever. There's a gleam in her eyes as she slowly nods, smiling as that blood trickles from a tiny break in her flesh.

Her right arm is still limp at her side- but by now that is entirely an act.

Her left cracks it's shoulder as she grins wider- a gleam in her eyes.

"..So you got something like that, too..? Yeah... YEAH! I felt that, and it was head on! YEAH! Come on... show me more! Do more! LET'S KEEP ON DANCING, BABY!" She cries out with glee, as she tenses low and braces herself- anticipation burning in the battle-maniac's eyes.* - Thu Nov 12 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: ......Wow, Mitsunara is crazy as fuck.... - Thu Nov 12 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) whispers: 35 damage I think.) - Thu Nov 12 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Looks like Mitsunara has her hands full. - Thu Nov 12 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) moves with a deceptive alacrity.

As her foe begins to unwrap her scarf and ready herself- she speaks softly.

"If you're doing that.. I'll have to do this." 

It's a simple statement- deceptively so. Her right arm suddenly moves, as her foe's body turns red. As she begins to charge, her hands lift up above her head together.

As her foe charges- it comes down. Something has formed in her hands. A purple Nodachi comes crashing down a second after the first strike- an expansively huge one, crashing towards her foes shoulder.

"GODAMN--!" She cries out- as the first blow strikes her own shoulder, and the second hits her midsection...

And then her oversized Nodachi, currently expanded ,crashes down into Mana's shoulder at full force. For a second- those nearby can see a spectral figure of a young man, pushing the blade down from within it, a mad gleam in his eyes just the same as her own, as the blade comes crashing down with a titanic force.* - Thu Nov 12 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) whispers: (What's the dmg on that?) - Thu Nov 12 23:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Probably need a medic... - Thu Nov 12 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly, panting herself as blood drips from her body, and she lets the unnatural purple blade in her hands fade away into so much smoke- a lazy smile on her face.

"That was... pretty fun.." She admits softly- a warm smile on her face as the two bruises from the girls attacks start to form.

"...Wanna do this again sometime- after I get you to a medic?"* - Thu Nov 12 23:38:14 2015
