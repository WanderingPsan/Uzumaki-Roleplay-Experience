<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as they ride the Caravan over to Kirikagure. It's a decently quuick trip on that fine Caravan- as she sits on it and looks to Chikyu the entire trip. The message is, of course, wrapped in a scroll as they walk along- before she looks over as they disembark. She hops out and nods to Chikyu.

"I believe this is Kirikagure, yeah." She says lazily- looking around quietly.* - Tue Nov 17 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) laughs softly at Chikyu's display, a gentle smile on her lips as she tucks her hands into her pockets and nods slowly.

"Nah, it's cool- I understand.... Shit, I've never seen anything like this before either... the place I moved to Sunagakure from was.... even worse of a desert, so.." She chuckles softly- as she walks across the bridge steadily, hands in her pockets, Iron blade at her hip...

"....Mrm....The water sure is beautiful, huh..? And there's.. so much of it.."* - Tue Nov 17 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods serenely as she looks over the area- a thoughtful expression on her face as she surveys it.

"Yeah... it sure is a beautiful place... but let's be on guard, yeah..? We might get attacked, if we tarry too long to deliver the letter.. and we'll probably have to walk back after delivering it, rather than take a caravan. So... even if it is really beautiful- don't let your guard down." She warns softly as she walks along the bridge- chuckling softly.

"As for my homeland... I fled for a reason."* - Tue Nov 17 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods gently as they walk along- sighing.

"I don't really like talking about it, no.. not too much, anyway... still. Let's find the house we're delivering a letter to, then get the hell outa here, yeah?" She suggests calmly- a chuckle escaping her lips.* - Tue Nov 17 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well.. - Tue Nov 17 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You figure out where we're supposed to take this, yeah? - Tue Nov 17 02:16:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles and waves, one hand in her pocket as she grins lazily.

"Yo. We're here to deliver a message to a civilian for a mission. Hope you don't mind us just headin in, delivering it, and leavin?" She says politely, a relaxed smile on the tall womans face.* - Tue Nov 17 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, handing over the scroll with a relaxed smile.

"Michael, I believe." She states calmly- handing him the rolled up message. "It's from a 'Miritsuwara'." She says calmly- handing him the letter from one NPC to another.* - Tue Nov 17 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, saluting.

"Yeah, sure. I'll tell Kazekage-Sama-Senpai-Sensei-Kun you said that, definitly." She says in a laidback tone, before turning to walk away, hands in her pockets.

"Hope you have a good one, yeah? May the uh.... whatever religous entities you believe in, watch over you!"* - Tue Nov 17 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) strolls of casually, humming.* - Tue Nov 17 02:45:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hey, wanna stop by Konoha on the way back..? - Tue Nov 17 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles as they walk through all the trees- relaxed and calm, only vaugely at all feeling for anything as she keeps her hands in her pockets- humming serenely.

"Well, that was easy."* - Tue Nov 17 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) frowns as the mist fills the area. Her response is, perhaps, expected of her by her traveling companion- if not the presumed company of bandits likely to be nearby. She speaks in a laughing tone.

"Fuck you, chumps. I don't have shit worth anything anyway, other than this sword at my hip, freind- and unless you want it through your bodies, you lot'll get out of our way." She says with a frown- as her meager sensory abilities are dampened and restrained completely. She draws her sword- but does little more as she breathes in- and focuses.

"You gonna get out of your ways, or am I gonna beat the lot of you to death with the first one of you I kill's corpse?"* - Tue Nov 17 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Sure is a lotta dudes.. - Tue Nov 17 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: I'll have to be careufl. Hopefully, only one or two of 'em are any good.. - Tue Nov 17 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) looks towards the voice, as the clones advance. She steps forwards- and moves her blade in a broad, blurring arc through most of those before her at once- a brutal arc that streaks out to cleave through the mist clones...

Only for them to part and shift into yet more- multiplying as the Jutsu dictates... and immediatly telling her something is wrong. As her crescent clears through the first group of clones to find nothing as she steps forwards- headed towards the voice...

Her eyes narrow.

"....Oh, this is some bullshit. That's a lot of Bunshins... but Bunshin's can't make voices, so whatever is speaking... has to be real." She states solemly- as Kunai come whizzing at her from the trees, as she tries to figure out where that voice is coming from.

The Kunai dig into her flesh and graze her- but they seem to be doing minimal damage, digging into her flesh and sticking in there. She grimaces as she looks around, frowning.

"...Ugh.. and there's people in the tree's..?" She grimaces- as she takes a second step forwards despite the pain being caused by the numerous small blades doing.. admitably, individually minimal damage, at the two that wedge into her sides after her single slash.* - Tue Nov 17 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) breathes in and grimaces. The group of Bunshins reforming around her after her initial sweep passes through nothing but mist. She breathes in.... and as she breathes out, her entire body tenses. She shakes her body to dislodge the two Kunai already in her body, as she tenses...

As several things happen at once. She feels two men surface.... and a barrage of Kunai launches towards her. This barrage, thankfully, seems far less dangerous than the initial volley. She barely has any time to react- so rather then avoid the attack fully, her movement lets her shift so that they graze their targets rather than hitting dead on- drawing thin lines of blood rather than wedging inside her... as she is already twisting her body.

Her blade flashes as the ball of Raiton chakra is launched towards her and Chikyu... and she throws it with her full body strength towards the man firing the technique- hoping that the blade's conductivity towards metal is enough to fully difuse the technique...

And that her strength is enough to ensure it hits him after piercing the orb of Raiton....

That's what she's hoping, anyway. If it misses, then the orb of raiton likely hits and stuns her. But if it hits... hopefully it does some damage.* - Tue Nov 17 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) frowns- as she walks up towards the fallen one and forms her Soul-Sword- holding it to his throat as the others flee. She knows there's no way she'll keep up with the crowd that just kidnapped her team-mate...

Especially when she has no idea where Chikyu was just taken. She stares at the man- and speaks softly as the others flee with her younger freind. There's a hateful gleam in her eyes- as she speaks simply.

"Listen here, shit-face. You're going to tell me where you're freinds are based from. If you do, I carry you to Kiri for a Medic, and a prison sentance. You live. If you don't- I torture you to death, then devour your soul. You're call, home boy." She says calmly- at the badly bleeding man.

"Decide quick- you don't have long before the wound already on your body kills you."* - Tue Nov 17 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) snarls as he does so, thrusting her blade into his throat as he dies out of frustration to feed her sword on his soul. She twists it into his throat and snarls, ripping it free and glaring at the already-dead corpse.

"Cowardly piece of shit.." She snarls- before looking around and... of course... finding no traces. She slams her foot down and thinks for a long moment- frowning.

"Shit... is there even anywhere nearby they could hide..? Come on... if I just head back to the village, she might.. but I have no way of finding where they all went after that shit.." She grumbles.* - Tue Nov 17 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) snarls in frustration as she dismisses her blade, and stalks off homeward...* - Tue Nov 17 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as she jogs across the forest- moving at a steady, limber pace; resting occasionally as she moves on- now alone, with Chikyu kidnapped.

"This is going to suck ass... explaining how my squadie got kidnapped and I couldn't do shit..?" She grimaces as she jogs through the wilderness...* - Tue Nov 17 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) just keeps running along over time- worry in her eyes as she does.

"This is going to suck, so bad... this fucking SUCKSSS, godamnitttt.." She grimaces- snarling and wishing the one man hadn't made use of some kind of... Cyanide capsule.

"..I mean, who kills themselves to avoid questioning, really!"* - Tue Nov 17 04:24:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) approaches the scene, panting as she wipes her forehead.

"Yo.. Kazekage. I got issues to report. Message was delivered to Kiri without issue, and the Mizukage sends his regards- but on our way back from the mission... we got attacked by some... well, they wheren't normal bandits- they used Ninjutsu, so rogue Shinobi. There was a mist... I killed one dude- but when the mist cleared, they had Taken Chikyu and there was like.. no trace of them. I don't know how to track, so I.. came back to report this and hopefully get someone sent out with me to go hunt them down?"

And breathes in- before lighting it on fire as she breathes out- flame shrouding the blade unstably. She breathes in- and let's that flame fade, a moment later.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out as she breathes in again- focusing as she kneads the chakra in her stomach... then breathes out, as she ignites it around her blade once more.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) breathes in, and out- as she once more focuses her chakra to ignite her blade. She takes a step forwards, swinging it through the air, then dropping the blade down through the air- flames sizzling the air around her weapon as she steps into it and back- practicing sword Kata with the chakra flow active breifly, before letting it go again.

"Mrm... Ai, any idea when we'll move out?"* - Tue Nov 17 05:31:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow at Rias as the big-breasted girl walks towards her, even as she ignites her blade in Katon chakra again.

"Something Izanami taught me the other night- Katon Chakra Flow. Or, to put it simply. I'm settin my godamn sword on fire." She states with a lazy smile, as she makes a sweep through the air with the iron weapon, then a stab, then a slash... before pulling it back and turning of the fire.* - Tue Nov 17 05:33:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and nods, as she draws the blade back to her waist, then ignires it again as she makes an opening slash- a lazy smile on her lips as she nods- letting her basic skills handle igniting the blade again and again for her practice.

"Mrm.. yeah. Well- this is my only fire technque, but.. yeah. It sure is pretty useful though, definitly. So, how you been since arriving her in Suna, Ria...? Apart from ditchin Konoha, it seems." She muses- noting the new headband and remembering their previous encounters. She seems pretty relaxed as, after a while, she lets the flow drop.* - Tue Nov 17 05:40:03 2015

"Huh, I see." She muses idly as she nods at Rias. "And I see- so you intend to reclaim the village once you're an exceptionally strong Jounin, so as to avoid the issues of dealing with the village in it's weakened state... I feel you, yeah."
