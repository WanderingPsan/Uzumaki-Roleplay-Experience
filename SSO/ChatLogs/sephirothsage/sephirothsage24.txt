<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Out here, behind the houses, works pretty well. - Wed Nov 18 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Ladies first. - Wed Nov 18 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles idly- as she draws her Iron Katana and nods... breathing in, then out.

"A'right. Sure. Ladies first, huh..? Let's dance!" She says energetically- as she lunges in, holding her Katana left handed as her right winds back at her waist level. The left opens with a relatively simple diagonal slash towards his chest area as she leads with the left.

It's a simple opener... which means it has to be a trap, right?* - Wed Nov 18 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins... as he launches his counterattack to avoid the initial stroke. Her arm is indeed launched upwards- the blow avoided by way of the kick throwing her arm up- jarring the limb and throwing it off course- as she rotates her body...

And drives her right hook into the leg that just attacked- moving to grab him by the ankle as his kick connects- her sensory abilities kicking into gear on the side as she focuses on him..

And then twists to try and rip him up into the air, and throw him at a cactus with the hand grasping his leg- if the grab is successfull, anyway..!

"WAAAAHAHAHAHAAAAA!"* - Wed Nov 18 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) lowers her blade down- that arm still sore, a bit slower after taking that hit, as she turns to face him as he is picking Cactus thorns free of his body.

"Tch.. I didn't expect those to actually pierce your skin much, y'know." She teases lightly, as she lowers the blade to point it at him, leaning back as she focuses her sensory ability- meager as it is- entirely on this man.

"So, how about you start the dance this step, eh?" She teases- as she winds back and tenses her body- staring at him.

"Give you a little more time to get rid of those pin pricks, too, if you want."* - Wed Nov 18 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Fast... - Wed Nov 18 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) ducks slightly... and moves her swordarm, more importantly.

Her foe has room to move- and he fills it quickly, darting in suprisingly fast... as her blade blurs. Her arm pumps with chakra, and moves far faster than she normally can- to intersect his body as he makes the initial attack; hoping to break his combo before it can really get started by using the superior reach of the Katana to strike him before he can reach, and force him back as she takes a single step backwards...

Hoping to at least narrowly avoid his stroke- though if the initial blow lands, it'll likely stun her for a moment due to striking in the forehead... but she's banking heavily on her Crescent Moon strike technique- having aimed for his center of mass to make the attack as accurate as she could as it moves in a vertical arc towards his body.

"Tch...." She grimaces, as her right arm tenses at her side- and she hopes her manuvear will work.

"Hrm.."* - Wed Nov 18 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts. Meanwhile, she takes the time in which he is skidding back to steady herself and adjust her posture- restoring her blade to a ready posture. She watches him- feeling his position as she tenses and opines aloud as he draws his Kunai.

"Do you think I should start.. using my real sword?" She inquires almost playfully, as she focuses briefly... and twists her blade as he lunges in for the right hook- moving to deliver a wicked slash towards his shoulder as she steps into the blow to her rib cage- grunting as it jars her entire body, sending waves of pain through her..

But she endures it. She endures his blow- for the sake of pushing her blade to land one on his shoulder, as her right hand lurches out to grab the one that just planted itseld against her ribs- and pull him closer, ripping his hand under her armpit to try and pull him into the strike and leave him unsteady.

"Hrm?"* - Wed Nov 18 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles at his choice of words- letting go and headbutting him as she does- before throwing herself back- throwing her Iron blade aside to the wind as she skids through the sand; hoping to have bought herself enough time with the headbut to make some distance, as she brings her hands down and together at her waist- a lazy grin on her lips.

"Fair enough, darlin...." She says softly- as she sways slightly from the headbut; having admitably, admirable toughness.. but not being impervious, and indeed being quite dazed by this point.

"Let me show you then..!" She says with a broad smile- as the Iron blade drops into the sand a distance away... and something else is called to her hands. It's a long, purple blade- seemingly called as an exertion of chakra into her hands as she forms it- it's edge gleaming brightly in the harsh light of the desert as the blade forms.

It's a Nodachi- and an exceptional one, at that.

"I'm ready to keep goin when you are." She states with a broad grin- swaying slightly from the pain in her midsection..* - Wed Nov 18 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Wait did she just call me darlin? - Wed Nov 18 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) steadies herself after a moment of concentration and focus- then nods, grinning wide as she holds her blade out to the side, at her hip- edge faced backwards, so that it's the flat facing towards her foe.

"So..... Let's dance!" She says with a broad grin- as the weapon's edge lights up with flames as she makes her fist slash on the advance- using the weapons large reach to cover broad area's with each sweeping slash as she first steps forward and slashes diagonally upwards- from hip to shoulder, the flaming Nodachi rends the air as she lunges in- a laugh on her lips.

"Show me your real moves, kid!"* - Wed Nov 18 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as he goes back, then bounds forwards- reversing the blade in her hands to keep the blunt side faced towards her foe as she lifts it up to the pinacle of it's arc...

And, with the flames dying down after that brief burst of intensity...  As his first kick lands to the back of her legs and pushes her forwards, but doesn't quite make her fall- a crescent comes arcing down towards him to interupt his intended combo- this one diagonal from above, a broad spiral arc downwards in the shape of a crescent moon once more as she moves to slam it towards his side- laughing the entire time as she staggers forwards and pivots to keep the blade flowing- panting lightly as her chakra runs low...* - Wed Nov 18 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) is hit, and it turns out she was a shadow clone all along!* - Wed Nov 18 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) pants softly as their initial exchange ends with her staggering back as she recovers her initial grip on the huge Nodachi- stepping back as her foe rolls back and springs up.

She takes the moment while he's charging at her to steady herself- breathing in... then out. He leaps into the air, and she grunts as she rolls- taking the kick to the shoulder as she steps forth, and twists her body as it is delivered to throw him off balance in the air...

Then slashes at him as he's springing to the ground after delivering the kick- heaving out a breath of air as she feels pain surge through her.

"Ah.. if we don't stop soon.. someone.. will get seriously hurt!"* - Wed Nov 18 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) laughs- a deep, full body thing...

And then her blade fades into smoke, and she falls backwards too- sweat clinging to every pore of her body, and her entire physioligy strained by the low chakra left in her system.

"Aha..... Ah, fuck, that was fun... yeah, let's do this more often- but for now..? Let's just... catch a breather.. phew.."* - Wed Nov 18 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh... - Wed Nov 18 05:45:36 2015

"There's food at the Hungry Ant... Mhrm."* - Wed Nov 18 05:49:52 2015

"Mrm.. So, what're you havin?"* - Wed Nov 18 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) laughs at that- shrugging before turning to order..

An awful lot of fried chicken, and some ramen on the side, with Sake. She stretches out- and turns to look at him as she decides to calmly wait.

"So, what's up with you, anyway? Don't think we've met before today.."* - Wed Nov 18 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) blinks and scratches her head- then gasps.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I need to do a better job of standing out. - Wed Nov 18 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) coughs awkwardly, rubbing the back of her head.

"Sorry. Poor memory."* - Wed Nov 18 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Eh.. nah. - Wed Nov 18 06:01:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and shrugs.

"It's nothing personal... I just lack the capacity." She drawls idly- lying, but that's nothing new- as she looks over and nods- sighing.

"Yeah.. our food should be out soon."* - Wed Nov 18 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Is the food good here? - Wed Nov 18 06:03:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I was just looking for Hanai and Momura. I figured I'd stop here since they are always either here or home. - Wed Nov 18 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You haven't seen them have you? - Wed Nov 18 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I don't even Know who they are. - Wed Nov 18 06:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I don't care. - Wed Nov 18 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles- as the plates of fried chicken arrive, along with the bottle of Sake and two bowls of ramen.

"Ah.. about time." She says hungrily- reaching for the chicken and getting started on her eating.

"...Mrm..So, mrm... sup with you lately, Kuro?"* - Wed Nov 18 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Your old enough to drink MItsu? - Wed Nov 18 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I've drunk before. - Wed Nov 18 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: That's not what I asked though Mitsu. - Wed Nov 18 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Are you old enough? - Wed Nov 18 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins lazily at Hiroshi and shrugs.

"You know, I actually don't know. Never kept track of my birthdays." She says- honestly, at that- as she shrugs and chuckles, pouring out a glass from the bottle in the middle of the table before setting the bottle back, and returning to her chicken.

"But I drink every now and then, and I handle my liqour pretty well, so.. Probably?"* - Wed Nov 18 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: As for that, Kuro... - Wed Nov 18 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. - Wed Nov 18 06:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: What was the mission? - Wed Nov 18 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and shrugs as she reaches for a cup of sake she just poured, and tips it back to take a long drink before setting it down with a sigh.

"Ah... Chikyu had been kidnapped. I was part of the squad that went to rescue her.... admitably, Ai being along made the mission pretty easy." She muses aloud- smiling laxly.* - Wed Nov 18 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Is Chiky alright? - Wed Nov 18 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Where is she? - Wed Nov 18 06:24:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . .  - Wed Nov 18 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: What about Mentally? - Wed Nov 18 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's the female with the large sword correct? - Wed Nov 18 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And when I visited her, she seemed to be in a pretty good state mentally. - Wed Nov 18 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: She's holding together pretty well- yeah, that's right Kuro. - Wed Nov 18 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Fourteen Year old, big sword. - Wed Nov 18 06:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Something must have happened. - Wed Nov 18 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: She'd been kidnapped while we where on a Message Delivery mission earlier.. - Wed Nov 18 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: When we found her, well.. - Wed Nov 18 06:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Tortured? - Wed Nov 18 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: What? - Wed Nov 18 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: .. Yeah, he'd been lashing her with a whip and... - Wed Nov 18 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: And. . .  - Wed Nov 18 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ....Well, I'll leave it at that- there was a bit more, but.. nothin I wanna talk about over my fuckin dinner. - Wed Nov 18 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . . .  - Wed Nov 18 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Poor Chiky. . .  - Wed Nov 18 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see..So it must have been horrific. - Wed Nov 18 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'll just say she wasn't quite raped, but that's probably because we got there quick. - Wed Nov 18 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And... I'm sure it was, for her. - Wed Nov 18 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: The guy responsible and his entire gang are all dead now, though, so.. - Wed Nov 18 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Wed Nov 18 06:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: If they didn't kill him I would have asked to kill him myself. . .  - Wed Nov 18 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs and takes another, longer drink of her Sake, before moving back to her food- tearing into the chicken voraciously.

It is perhaps worth noting that not once throughout this discussion has her expression changed even once.

"So, Kuro. Still believe that a guy who kidnaped, tortured, and nearly raped a little girl, shouldn'ta died, pacifist?" She inquires almost off handedly through a mouthful of chicken.* - Wed Nov 18 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) has engaged maximum conversational savagery.* - Wed Nov 18 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't believe he should have. My belief of all lives being sacred still stands. However, he should face his sins. - Wed Nov 18 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: And facing his sins got him what he deserved. . . death - Wed Nov 18 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Fuck that noise about him not dying. - Wed Nov 18 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't mean that he should die, but karma follows everything. - Wed Nov 18 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Death as a punishment I believe is too lenient. People can't reflect on their errors. - Wed Nov 18 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Fuck karma, that man deserved to die. - Wed Nov 18 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So... - Wed Nov 18 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: He did not. He's a human just like you and I. We all do things that we are ashamed of. - Wed Nov 18 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Am I a bad person for killin them? - Wed Nov 18 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Hell no you aren't - Wed Nov 18 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: And he was no human if he could do that to Chiky. - Wed Nov 18 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: He was a demon in human skin. - Wed Nov 18 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: There's no such thing as good or evil.  There's only acts of selfish desire and acts of compassion and kindness. - Wed Nov 18 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . . .  - Wed Nov 18 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: That is bullshit - Wed Nov 18 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) is chuckling as she sets down her chicken and shrugs.

"Nah, he was human. He bled red, used Ninjutsu.." She chuckles again, as she reaches for the Sake and takes a long, long draught of it. "Same as me, really... well, he's probably more human than me.." The necromancer muses- laughing louder briefly- before sighing and calming down.

"Mrm.... Well, Kuro. What I am asking is... do you think that what I did is wrong?" She inquires lazily. "I'm curious. I know how I feel about it... and that's absolutely nothing- I don't have any emotional response at all, just a logical one that it helped someone I like, so it was right. What about you?" She inquires idly, as she sips her Sake.* - Wed Nov 18 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I believe that there could have been a different way to solve the problem without taking ones life, howver at the time you saw that as the only solution. - Wed Nov 18 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: My god, you really are a hippy.. - Wed Nov 18 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: ... - Wed Nov 18 06:37:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: ... - Wed Nov 18 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) yawns and leans back, smiling laxly as she finishes her own meal.

"Mrm...Anyway, yeah. See you two around, yeah..?"* - Wed Nov 18 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Peace, yo. - Wed Nov 18 06:50:27 2015

"Was just here to show you somethin, Marco- but it seems yall are busy." She says wit ha shrug- smiling at Hassan and Rias, waving.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks into the square, yawning as she stretches out, looking around and blinking a few times.

"....Lots of new faces.." She drawls softly, looking around with her hands in her pockets and yawning.. Her mission to deliver supplies took her out of the village- and out of touch- longer than expected, it seems...

"..Ugh, wonder what I missed while I was delivering shit to those damn Samurai.."* - Tue Dec  1 23:59:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs, after that long moment of looking around- then tucks her hands into her pockets and sighs, closing her eyes.

She missed a war- the thought echoes tauntingly in her mind... She clenches her fists, as she looks around and breathes- then turns to look at Ivel, nodding slightly.

"...Yo, how you doin?" She asks softly- frowning quietly as she turns to face him. "......Sorry I missed the war. I was out on a bullshit mission, just got back....Ugh.." She groans- before blinking.

"Elite Shinobi Group? The fuck?"* - Wed Dec  2 00:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) rubs the back of her neck awkwardly- frowning. It's clear she's not used to, or good at, giving others sympathy- as she looks around with a slight frown... seeming just... generally annoyed.

"....Guess I'm livin alone, now.." She murmurs as she looks up- clenching her fists tighter. "Ugh... how dare that idiot Yan die on me... what a jerk.." She grumbles quietly- before relaxing her hands and looking around.

"Anyway.... guess those guys are in legally... uh, sorry to you to, Ivel- about your Grandpa."* - Wed Dec  2 00:10:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) looks over her shoulder and smiles weakly at Momura, moving to disengage from the conversation at hand with a sigh.

"Glad to hear it." She responds softly to Momura's affirmation of being okay- a gentle smile on her face as she tucks her hands into her robes. "....Your sister still around?"* - Wed Dec  2 00:12:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) coughs awkwardly.

"...Thought he was a chick.." She murmurs to Momura- before looking over at Chikyu and smiling faintly- a weak smile that lacks real joy.

"...Yo, Chikyu, hey.... Been a while... Sorry I wasn't around when shit hit the fan- I'd left on a mission... just got back home.."* - Wed Dec  2 00:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at the dialouge from the others- then turns as Chikyu approaches and hugs her back- her own grip as bone crushing as ever as she grins wide, before stepping back and nodding.

"Heh... No need to worry about me. I'm too awesome to die before I want to, you know?" She says with that half smile to Chikyu- before sighing. "And I guess this just gives me more time to prepare for the next set of Chuunins, so it's whatever." She says with a half smile- before looking to Momura.

"Anyway. If you wanna fight, sure. Let's fight, heh."* - Wed Dec  2 00:18:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles as they walk into the Arena, cracking her shoulders and smiling faintly as she performs a few smooth handseals, then steps to the side- as a clone of herself forms beside herself- outwardly seeming to be a normal bunshin, complete with a copy of her Iron Katana as she stretches.

"Eh.. I've been slacking, if I'm entirely honest. I was a bit focused on just getting to the destination, and carrying supplies for those damn Samurai.." She admits lazily- speaking in Unison with the Bunshin as she and it take matching starting postures.

"Anyway.. I guess I'm ready when you are, heh."* - Wed Dec  2 00:22:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Hiroshi. - Wed Dec  2 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: How's it going Kyu? - Wed Dec  2 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Aah. Nice moves. I want it. - Wed Dec  2 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins slightly as her foe lunges fowards- then schools her expression into a serene calm. She steps forwards and to the side- not fully dodging the blow, but shifting to roll with it to minimize damage as her clone steps to the other side, holding it's blade firmly- and swinging for Momura's back...

Even as she herself lunges with her right hand for Momura's gut- as Momura's strike lands against her chest and pushes into it- eliciting an audible grunt from her as she endures the pain with a practiced measure..

But also, clearly causing her some pain that she has to endure- a certain jump up from Momura's previous showings!

As a blow from her right hand hammers forwards into her foes guts, while her Shadow clone swings for her back... and her left holds the Katana out to the side, not striking with it yet as she grins lazily.

"Better...." She admits calmly- tilting her head to the side as she stares at Momura.* - Wed Dec  2 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as her foe flips the clone forwards. It bursts into an explosion of electricity as it is dispersed by her own fist that it was pulled into... a grin on her lips as it bursts into electricity briefly... 

Energy that courses through her body at a low enough frequency to do almost nothing to her... as she steps through that burst- sighing.

"Heh. Not bad...." She admits lazily, as her left arm shifts to the side- then whips forwards to push through where Momura has moved to be standing- as her right hand lifts to grab at the leg that plants into her chest to minimal effect..

Even as her left swings a blade for her foes midsection- a laugh on her lips.

"Not bad at all! But if you can do more- you'd better not play aroun with me, even if I'm not using my real sword..!"* - Wed Dec  2 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Hi Sensei. - Wed Dec  2 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as her foe worms in her hold to avoid the Katana stroke- but fails to evade being grabbed.

She grunts at the kick to her face- but seems to endure pretty well; indeed, hitting her is an almost painful action at this point... as she twists her body- and with a grip firm on her foes ankle...

Pivots to slam her into the sand without letting go of her until she impacts the ground, before stepping back and grinning as she cracks her shoulders- shaking her head to steady herself after the dizziness of being kicked in the face.* - Wed Dec  2 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) takes a step back- and breathes as her foe dissapears in smoke.

"So, you're not holding back anymore..? Guess I won't insult you, and I'll stop too.." She says lazily- a fierce grin on her face as she lifts her hands above her hand- and molds chakra between them into a blade...

Forming the sword of her soul into a two handed grip above her own head as she steps back- and breathes in- eyes closing as she relies upon her minimal sensory abilities to feel for Momura's general location- turning to keep her self faced towards Momura as the purple Nodachi forms.

"Heh.... stop hiding whenever, darlin."* - Wed Dec  2 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles as her foe begins to move rapidly to try and confuse her sensory abilities... and breathes in- then out. She is already shifting as her foe moves to be behind her- so the punching blow strikes her thigh rather than her ass- causing that technque to lack it's intended effects- though the blow certainly hurts.

She chuckles at that, before another punch arcs up into her fist- and her blade comes down in a brutal crescent as she is launched up- as her foe brings up an uppercut to strike her upwards...

Her own blade moves impossibly fast to meet her- the steel coming towards the girl as the motion to launch her comes upwards....

Determining whether or not she is struck in the back by whether or not Momura continues her attack, or manages to actually dodge the blow...!

"BWAAAHHHAAA!"* - Wed Dec  2 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) steps back after her own blow misses as well- squinting at Momura then shrugging as she lets it fade entirely.

"If you'd like, sure."* - Wed Dec  2 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh. Fair enough. - Wed Dec  2 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she turns to look at Kuro, and crooks an eyelid.

"Hrm? My, but it has. How have you been?" She inquires with a relaxed, lazy smile.* - Wed Dec  2 01:55:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs, at that.

"Anyway, I suppose I'm available whenever you are." She says with a lazy smile.* - Wed Dec  2 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Can we start now? - Wed Dec  2 02:05:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Alright. - Wed Dec  2 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: -- Or well.. Bokken.. - Wed Dec  2 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And show me how your holding it. - Wed Dec  2 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) strokes her chin as she looks at him, squinting at his positioning.

"The foot work? That's fine.... I guess." She admits softly- as she analyzes him quietly. "However... Hrm..." She draws her own Katana. "Alright- now. I want you to modify your positioning.. to resemble mine." She says firmly- as she adjusts her posture....

And draws her sword. She takes a slightly different posture- half crouched, sword held in both hands at the waist level. Her knees are slightly bent, and her left foot is forwards, while her left is back- leaning onto her rear foot.

"Now, admitably.... I'm not the best in proper form. What I know of swordsmanship, is.... mostly to do with adapting, and a few moves." She admits softly- as she adjusts. 

"Now, this is a working posture. From here, you can quickly flow into starting any kind of movement. You keep the sword at waist level for most manuvears.. or.." She shifts- lifting it above her head as she shifts her posture....

"You hold it above your head, to ready yourself for a heavy downward slash. That's my general posture, anyway- with a Katana, that is.... so, try those two poses. See which one feels more natural."* - Wed Dec  2 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Your Chakra control is really damn good, right? - Wed Dec  2 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's alright. Why? - Wed Dec  2 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly- then chuckles.

"Mrm... so. A'right. Let me show you what makes the upper stance actually useful. It's a technique that I came up with a while back. See... this low stance.." She says with a smile- shifiting into the waist stance.

"This is good for normal manuvears." She says calmly, as she makes a few smooth, practiced swipes.

"I prefer to use a Katana one handed, myself- but I'm going to act like I would with my proper sword, y'know? Now- for why the other stance is solid.." She explains- as she lifts the blade above her head... and grins. She takes a step forwards- and brings the blade down in a sudden, blurring crescent- the air parting.

The blade touches the ground within a second.

"This stance is used for this one move, and others like it. It enables you to react to any kind of attack coming at you, so long as you can attack faster- turning offense into defence. The reason I asked about your chakra control, is because you have to manipulate your chakra to attain the speed of the crescent moon strike. Feel me?"* - Wed Dec  2 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So long as you have at least Genin level control, we're good. - Wed Dec  2 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You use that wierd uh. Hitting peoples internal organs shit, yeah? - Wed Dec  2 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You should be good enough to do this. - Wed Dec  2 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Because- a'right. - Wed Dec  2 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Basically? - Wed Dec  2 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You pump chakra through your arms and into the blade to push it faster, moving the weapon with more speed and force to strike near isntantly. - Wed Dec  2 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ah. That doesn't sound too complex. - Wed Dec  2 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's not, nah. - Wed Dec  2 03:12:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: In that case- I highly advise against using a sword. - Wed Dec  2 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's a lot harder to avoid lethally injuring someone with a sword, than it is with your bare hands. - Wed Dec  2 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: With a Taijutsu blow, you simply avoid critical regions and hold back slightly... - Wed Dec  2 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: With Kenjutsu? - Wed Dec  2 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Any blow to any part of the body... - Wed Dec  2 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Can potentially be fatal. - Wed Dec  2 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Blood Loss, shock, trauma... - Wed Dec  2 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A Katana is far, far more lethal than your bare hands. - Wed Dec  2 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see..But this is not something I'm learning for the sake of harming others. I'm aiming to use it was a tool for meditation, and if need, a tool for self defense. - Wed Dec  2 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You want to learn Swordsmanship... - Wed Dec  2 03:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: .... - Wed Dec  2 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, in that case... - Wed Dec  2 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I believe it'll help focus my mind and train my body at the same time. - Wed Dec  2 03:17:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You can just practice the forms, and stuff. - Wed Dec  2 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's all I wish to learn. The forms and the basics. - Wed Dec  2 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: But- yeah. That basic stance, and that one move. All I got for you- my actual techniques are all.. yeah. - Wed Dec  2 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You mean that large light you made with your blade? - Wed Dec  2 03:23:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I presume you mean when I make a blade out of... energy, yeah? - Wed Dec  2 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't wish to learn something like that.  - Wed Dec  2 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You couldn't anyway. - Wed Dec  2 03:26:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs, tilting her head back and rubbing it, sighing as she slumps out of posture to hold her Katana lazily to the side in her left as she scratches her head with the right...

"...Ugh... sorry, just... bit distracted mentally, I guess.."* - Wed Dec  2 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Aren't you a human too? - Wed Dec  2 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Meditation helps with the distractions. - Wed Dec  2 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Heh... just- I only just got home, and only recently found out about Yan's death... so.. - Wed Dec  2 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ah. So this is a bad time for you in a way. - Wed Dec  2 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You should rest then. I didn't know you were feeling mentally exhausted. - Wed Dec  2 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... Nah, it's fine. - Wed Dec  2 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I like having my mind on other things, anyway. - Wed Dec  2 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So- okay - Wed Dec  2 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Any questions at the moment? - Wed Dec  2 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hm... - Wed Dec  2 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Nothing at all that I can think of.  - Wed Dec  2 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A'right then... Hrm. - Wed Dec  2 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Interested in that one technique then- or nah? - Wed Dec  2 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hm..The one you just showed me? - Wed Dec  2 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes. I would like to know about it. - Wed Dec  2 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, as she shifts her posture back into a two handed grip, holding the blade at the hip, and to the side once more- two handed and out to the side- before she makes another broad, crescent shaped arc; this one sideways as she steps forwards- then steps back.

"Notice that no matter how I swing the blade... it forms the crescent. You swing the blade with your chakra fueling the stroke; and it forms that crescent shape. That's the point of the arc... it's always a broad stroke, though- so you need room for it. Y'feel me?"* - Wed Dec  2 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she squints at that.
