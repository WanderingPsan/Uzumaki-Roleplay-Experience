She steps forwards- pushing the huge blade through the sand after d ropping it down- then as it begins to shrink, let's the entire thing fade.

"Still.. exhausting.. need to rest between swings like this.."* - Fri Nov 13 01:34:17 2015

She focuses- breathes in.. and carefully does her best to feel the interplay of energy between her, the sword, and Yuudai's assimilated soul during the technique- doing her best to refine the flow and control it tighter, making it stronger as she breathes in, and out- then let's go of the blade and let's it fade away.

"...Okay... I'll just have to... right. Right.."* - Fri Nov 13 01:45:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So, this is about that sword you mentioned, when you where talkin to that one guy. - Fri Nov 13 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A necromantic blade, he said..? - Fri Nov 13 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes. - Fri Nov 13 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What of the sword? - Fri Nov 13 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly, leaning into the table curiously.

"Ah... well. I suppose you won't be the first person in town to know- that'd be Bryson and Yan- so... I'll level with you. I'm a Necromancer. I know a thing or two about the dark arts... and I might be able to figure out what's up with the blade, and if it's safe for you to keep around or not, if you let me have a look at it... plus, I'm interested in how you got a necromancer's sword. We aren't usually keen on parting with 'em."* - Fri Nov 13 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs, leaning back into her seat.

"Eh. If you attack me, you attack me. I may be a Necromancer- but I'm also a legally registered Shinobi of Konoha, so killing me is still legally murder. The Priest, Bryson, already knows- so does Yan, and I plan to tell the Kazekage eventually. I live here, not in the shithole I was born in, Huevo Diablo. Far as I'm concerned? You attack me, the legal system fucks you anally." She states placidly- before chuckling.

"As for the rest of it... like I said. I live here. Why would I be hostile to other people who do so? Oh, I'm a right bitch sometimes- but I'm a pragmatic woman, not a raving lunatic. Evil..? As for Evil.... that's a point of view. You'll find that the evil never think of themselves as such, and that those who think of themselves as truly righteous often effect evil just as splendidly as my kind, kid."* - Fri Nov 13 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) holds up a hand, gesturing for a pause.

"I'll cut you a deal, man. You tell me how you got that sword, and get me a look at it.. and I'll answer any questions you got. How 'bout it..?"* - Fri Nov 13 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, listening to what the man is saying. He stares at the man- then speaks calmly.

"To be frank..? I want to study it to figure out what kinda Necromancer this guy was... and then find a way to put it to use. I'll tell you the first thing you need to know about Necromancers. The general trend? Practicality." She says calmly.

"I didn't know the guy- but I know that if he was a fellow necromancer, the best way to honor his moldy dead ass, would be to make sure his shit kept being used, and used skillfully." She explains calmly- before nodding slowly.

"Anyway.... as for the whole 'honor the dead' thing.... Ironically, most necromancers don't actually fuck with corpses, or souls- Necromancer is a general term refering to practioners of the Dark Arts- which, yes, includes what most people think of as Necromancy. Anyway.. to go on... sure. Fair enough. Ask your questions about Huevo Diablo, yeah?"* - Fri Nov 13 03:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, I mean. I left Huevo for a reason- I don't care about any of that. I worship the Dark Lord Satan, yeah. There are tangible benefits to doin so, and he seems like a swell guy. - Fri Nov 13 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I don't give a damn about priests as long as they aren't in my way, and other Necromancers? - Fri Nov 13 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Same deal, really. - Fri Nov 13 03:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I believe "true peace" is a peace obtained that will never disolve. - Fri Nov 13 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If everyone has reached an understanding and are on the same wavelength, then it's possible for it to happen.  War breaks out usually becaue of greed, so I aim to eliminate the sense of selfishness and establish a sense of being. One where people aren't viewed as tools and as humans instead. - Fri Nov 13 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: To a mouse, a cat is a monster. To a human a bear is a monster, a beast. At the core, if we can understand then we can move in the right direction. - Fri Nov 13 04:06:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Someone who cannot be held in a cell, and is an utter psychopath? - Fri Nov 13 04:10:27 2015

"Their all saying their just hanging out." She begins- before shrugging, with a smile as she reaches for something on her back.

"But uh.... Yan told me to give you this. Said you'd know what was up." She says simply- as she hands Hassan the red scroll that Yan usually carries around on his back.* - Fri Nov 13 05:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as she tucks her hands into her pockets, and heads out to complete her mission- whistling quietly as she heads out....

To locate a runaway dog.

"This is going to be so boring.." She drawls as she heads off. "But at least it's something to do.." She muses as she heads off.* - Fri Nov 13 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks around the village for a while, before she finds it. The dog is whining quietly as it licks at a paw filled with cactus needles- whimpering in pain as it struggles to get away- but every step just pushes the needles deeper into it's little paw. She stares for a long moment- then sighs.

"What a poor creature.." She murmurs softly- as she walks towards the dog... and it growls at her. She stares right back at it- frownign as it bares teeth, despite it's injured paw.

"Oh, shut up you stupid thing.." She protests as she steps closer..* - Fri Nov 13 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) continues to advance closer to the dog- and it continues to growl. It's paw is only being made worse by it pressing it's feet down to stand it's ground- blood trickling from a likely infected wound, by this point- as it backs up closer to the cactus, and cuts itself on that, too.

"Good grief, you silly beast- you're just hurting yourself." She scolds it- as she crouches low- and with a swift motion.. pulls it away from the cactus. It struggles, at first- but she's strong enough to hold a wild dog with no issue, and not have to worry about it really hurting her..* - Fri Nov 13 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) continues to pin the creature with one arm- as the other.. removes the needles from it's paw, first- getting a whimper... and then it submits, quietly and meekly lowering it's head as she sighs in relief.

"Atta boy.. shh.. it'll be fine." She murmurs- sighing as she works to then remove the cactus needles from it's side and rear... before holding it up in her arms, curled up in her hands.. and smiling.

"Dumb beast, let me get you home." She says softly.* - Fri Nov 13 05:25:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as she comes to a halt by the staircase up, and looks at the guards for a moment, then to the puppy in her hands... then sh sighs again, as she shifts to lean against the wall with the puppy.. and wait.* - Fri Nov 13 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks out of the mansion and yawns, stretching out as she does.

"Mrm.."* - Fri Nov 13 07:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: It'll be speed training for me anyway. - Fri Nov 13 20:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins fiercely as she says that- lowering herself into a rather basic stance, planting her feet firmly- then holding up one hand.

"Come at me, yo." She says simply- as her eyes fix on him. "Eh..? You'll figure somethin out."* - Fri Nov 13 20:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) lashes out as he makes contact. She can't really see him moving- but she's used to him, so to speak. She's dealt with this man before, and his ludicrous speed. The side of her arm, as he fails to cut into it, slams out into the blade that just hit it- trying to snatch him by the wrist and pull him into her rather than let him get away.

"Heh... too quick.." She grumbles as she attempts to pull him in- if the initial grab is succesful, rearing back her other hand as she attempts to pull him into a vicous left hook to his face.* - Fri Nov 13 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) heaves a deep breath, as her initial strike fails to land. She plants her feet solidly against the earth, and breathes in, then out. It's a slow, steady motion as she refuses to actually look at him. He's moving too fast for her to follow- or even really /see/... so she's not going to bother attempting it.

".....Too quick." She murmurs softly, as she plants her feet solidly into the ground, and holds her arms to either side, readying herself to react as soon as he does something.* - Fri Nov 13 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shifts as he does. As the blade slashes towards her legs, she crouches- taking it almost like a shave to her upper leg- as her lower darts out in the direction the blade came from- aiming for his own, to upset him while he's moving so fast and trigger... issues.

It's a simple goal- knock him off his balance as he runs past her, with a deft kick low to the body as soon as his blade lands- hopefully before he can back out. He finds that his own blow does not upset her balance, either.

"Tch..."* - Fri Nov 13 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) meanwhile, had been taking a step towards his own point of falling- intent on following up what she accomplished there with some blows to keep him down and end this- sadly, he's out of range before she can truly reach him, as she resumes her initial posture- unsure what's coming next...

Before she takes a full body kick to the upper shoulder- having just been starting to crouch back down, having yet to crouch properly... She grunts- as this forces her to the side- even as her arms reach up to try and snatch the legs that just impacted her- her footing unsteady as she staggers, but her arms snapping out to grab him by both ankles...

"Hah! Momentum, huh..?"* - Fri Nov 13 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts- planting her feet down as he gets one free. As he struggles, she steadies herself at first- holding on tight as the hand that missed the other leg slides to fortify her grip on this one..

And then she starts to spin. She begins to rotate- relying on centrifugal force to lift him off of the ground as she begins to spin him around by one leg- rotating her body and relying on her suprisingly impressive brute strength to spin him right around.

"Haaaaa!"* - Fri Nov 13 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) after a few moments of spinning, getting up to near full speed as he tenses himself against her.. she grins, as he grabs her arms- and stares at him... as she lets go of his leg once he does that, but keeps spinning- as her arms shift their grip to his arms, as she rears back slightly to work against his pull- relying on two things.

Momentum. And her own strength. Her feet burrow into the sand, almost, as she continues to spin him right the fuck around- before letting go completely, so that he's only attached to her by his own hands...

As she keeps picking up centrifugal force. This is going to suck for her once she stops spinning- but hopefully, it'll suck for him more when he goes flying.

"WOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOO!"* - Fri Nov 13 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as she plants her feet fully after that brief exchange- steadying herself as she stares at him as he arcs back.... then once more breathes in, and focuses on nothing in particular to keep herself steady- and ready for his next attack.

"Yare Yare Daze... Slippery one."* - Fri Nov 13 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sweeps out her foot as she see's him pause as if to attack- intending to trip him as she steps into where he was- leading with a right hook that does indeed leave her open, if the leg sweep doesn't trip him.

"This is some real bullshit."* - Fri Nov 13 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: This shit isn't really fun. - Fri Nov 13 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Am I too fast? - Fri Nov 13 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as she holds her posture.

"You run around too much, and an entire fight of sitting still.. doin nothin.. is getting on my nerves.." She states- frowning.. as she shifts posture to a Kendo stance, hands at her waist.

"Guess I'm done playing around. This'll be done soon. C'MON!"* - Fri Nov 13 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) breathes in- then out... as she seems to be waiting for something, as she holds her hands together as if she already has a weapon in them, for some reason.* - Fri Nov 13 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) breathes.

That's all she's doing- as those with sensory abilities might notice her readying herself to gather chakra- kneading it into prepareadness.. as she lifts her two hands over her head.. and waits.* - Fri Nov 13 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) holds that position.. and waits.

"COME AT ME, ALREADY!"* - Fri Nov 13 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) spins and pivots as the blade cuts into her skin, but stops at skin deep... a suprising degree of resselience, to the man who just entered the gate's blade.. as she pivots in a harsh diagonal spin that gains in momentum rapidly- she twists on her heel as she was prepared to do, already well used to his habit of back-attacking from their first fight.

A blade has formed in her hands. A Nodachi- and it's a monstrous one, at that- having been somehow expanded to a prodigous size as she brings it down- it's long width, length, and reach meaning that even if he dodes, it is unlikely he'll be able to exit the area of the downward diagonal slash entirely due to the sheer area covered by the expanded Nodachi.

"Gotcha!" She says triumphantly as she brings it down. He has a second or two to react, due to the time it takes her to spin.. .and then..!* - Fri Nov 13 21:58:49 2015

Expands it with a surge of soul and Chakra- then drops it back down to crash into the earth, grunting as she does. She feels it- the chakra flowing the blade, the spiritual energy she's releasing... and breathes in, as she lets the blade fade after that single stroke.

"...One."* - Sat Nov 14 04:28:48 2015

It rends into the ground- expanding as it falls for another monstrous blow to the earth beneath her- she breathes in, then breathes out.

"Two." 

She states it solemly- as Yuudai's soul briefly flickers around her blade, before fading away with the purple lit-length of steel.* - Sat Nov 14 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) breathes in- then out... as she once more collects herself. Lifting her hands up high, she breathes in. She brings them down- expanding the blade and feeling it in her hands as she does, analyzing just what she is doing as Yuudai's soul screams from the use.

She breathes out, as the blade crashes into the sand.... and fades away.

As she pushes of the ground- expanding her mind as she slides forwards, eyes basically focused.... and mind expanding to take in her foe on a sensory level as she steps inwards to the fight, taking off across the sand in a sudden burst of speed.

She's faster than last time Momura fought her- significantly... moving almost twice as fast, as she opens.. rather simply- a right hook for her foes left shoulder, as her left hand winds back- a lazy grin on her face.

"I'll open of lightly!" She says with a note of arrogance, and a broad smirk.* - Sat Nov 14 04:50:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I'm not attractive, though.... - Sat Nov 14 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: I think I should learn a fighting style. That might be helpful. - Sat Nov 14 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: .. I should learn an actual style too... - Sat Nov 14 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You are very attractive. - Sat Nov 14 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hm... - Sat Nov 14 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: But.. how..? - Sat Nov 14 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) speaks calmly- as the blow lands straight into her forehead... and does nothing as she presses against it and past it- laughing cheerily as she does so. It fails to damage her, as usual- the damage spreading through her body, and not hurting her in the slightest as she presses through it, winding back her left fist... to slam it harder into her gut.

"So you can take more now, huh..?" She says with a broad grin. "Let's see how much more!" She roars, as she pushes her forehead against the other girls punch as she straightens up from her crouch- transitioning her lefthanded blow into an uppercut, grinding her knuckles against her foes gut and upwards- grinning wide as she steps into it.

"Wahoo!"* - Sat Nov 14 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: ((( 22 Damage. - Sat Nov 14 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: I finally gained my goal... what next..? - Sat Nov 14 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly- as her eyes remain on her foe. As the other girl backs off- she darts to the side.

"I see.. so you can take one or two hits from my fists... but one from my sword would probably split you right open, huh? A'right then!" She says, nodding as her analysis is complete- charging forwards.

It's quicker than she was before- but not quite quick enough, as she crouches and holds her arms low to the ground as she charges.

"So c'mon! You gotta fight back if you wanna win!" She taunts the other girl as she runs forwards.* - Sat Nov 14 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hm, seems like she's outmatched. - Sat Nov 14 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Atleast she fought. - Sat Nov 14 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Mhm, at least she -still is- fighting. - Sat Nov 14 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sweeps her right arm up- batting aside the Shuriken casually before they can reach her face as she then springs up to deliver a right hook to the side of her foes jaw- stepping into it as she moves to try and, in essence....

Punch her off of the wall to bring her back down where she can reach her properly- a lazy grin on her face as she is, at this point....

Simply waiting for her opponent to yield, really.

"Unless you have more to show me...."* - Sat Nov 14 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: This is pretty much over! - Sat Nov 14 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: .....Ah.. you don't have more, then..? - Sat Nov 14 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You okay? - Sat Nov 14 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I'm fine...I-I could keep going...b-but I won't.. - Sat Nov 14 05:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well... if you really think you'll be able to beat me one day, then sure. - Sat Nov 14 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I will..S-Soon! - Sat Nov 14 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Huh, a rival. That idea seems positive. - Sat Nov 14 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Then do your best, eh? Heh. - Sat Nov 14 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Y-Yea..! - Sat Nov 14 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Sat Nov 14 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Anyway, what's your name, Lady? - Sat Nov 14 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) turns and smiles at Nina, holding out a hand to shake.

"I wanna know your name before we fight, yeah?"* - Sat Nov 14 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A'right then... Heh. Let's space out n' get ready. Momura, mind gettin to the sides, just in ca- Atta girl. - Sat Nov 14 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So. - Sat Nov 14 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You want the first step in this dance.. - Sat Nov 14 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Or shall I? - Sat Nov 14 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: You can have it. - Sat Nov 14 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'll be right back - Sat Nov 14 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins and nods, lowering her center of balance lazily.

"A'right then. I won't go all out to start with... let's see how far you can make me go, yeah?" She says with a faint smile- and a fierce gleam in her eyes... as she kicks of the sand and launches herself forwards in a sudden movement. She steps to the side at the last moment, lashing out with her left arm towards her foes chin, from beside her as she turns to face her from the side with a grin.

It's a simple manuvear- in effect, as she plants her feet at the end of her dash, she moves to backhand her foe in the movement of stepping in and pivoting.* - Sat Nov 14 05:20:00 2015
