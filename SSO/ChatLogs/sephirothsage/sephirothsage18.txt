<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins- as her blow is dodged skillfully.. she takes the blow to the chest without so much as a grunt- her body hard like metal, almost- certainly, it's of similar durability... as the blow fails to so much as make her grunt out- as she rotates her body to flow sideways with the elbow, slamming her right hook forwards as she steps closer as her foe steps back- her own grin consistent and broad- a light burning in her eyes.

"Let's have some real fun, yeah?" She says almost lazily, as her left arm slides to hang low- near to her waist as the blow hammers forwards just as fast as the first as she steps in close- staying close as the right hook snaps in, and she brings up her left knee for her foes gut.

"Heh."* - Sat Nov 14 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts as her blows are evaded, and grins.

"Quick.. good on your feet... but I hope you have more power to hit me with than that." She says lazily- before the legsweep hits her leg- and sends her to the floor. She catches herself on her hands in a quick movement- and pushes herself back up...

But in the time that takes her, her foe has certainly created some distance- as she slides into a kendo posture instead- hands held together near her waist as she steps back- and breathes in.

"So come on. Show me more- hit me with all you've got! Don't hold back, yeah..? I hope you have been." She says with a grin- as she plants her feet into the sand and breathes in- rather than pursuing.

It's strange though. She's not wearing a sword... but her hands, emtpy as they are.. are held as if to grasp one.* - Sat Nov 14 05:36:12 2015

* - Sat Nov 14 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins faintly as her foe lunges in- and nods. A blade forms in her hands as her foe charges. She breathes in, as purple energy- her very soul singing in her hands... forms into a Nodachi.

She breathes out- as she steps forwards slightly- and brings it in a blurring sweep to stop her foes charge- using the immense reach of a Nodachi over a normal Katana to cut of her foes charge with a blurring sweep of the unnaturally sharp blade.

"Oh, I'm not too bad." She teases with a lazy smile- as the blade seems to whistle through the air incredibly fast to counter the other womans charge and downward slice.

"Not the best, but.."* - Sat Nov 14 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins faintly as her foe leaps back to avoid the brutal swing through the air, then shifts her grip to hold the blade low- in a thrusting posture, as she steps forward to chase her foe's retreat- stepping forwards to stab towards her midsection as she lands- flowing forwards elegantly and skillfully.

The thrust is strong and two handed as she pushes it forwards to reach out as her foe is still confused.

"Heh. I know, right? Still.. I'm impressed! Usually I've cut my foe by now! You're doin pretty good!" She says with a lazy grin as the blow thrusts forwards through the air as she steps fully into it.* - Sat Nov 14 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts- as the burst of wind forces her to pause her rush- making her skid backwards with her Nodachi- shifting from a thrust to guarding her body- making no further action this round- but grinning wide as the wind blows up dust that makes it hard to see her foe..

Forcing her to rely on her basic sensory abilities to feel her opponents location.

"Heh.... not bad... smart move... but can you actually use this moment..?"* - Sat Nov 14 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Hm.. - Sat Nov 14 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles calmly. She can't make out anything distinct- but she can feel her foes chakra like a beacon, swelling up... then she feels /something/ come towards her. She grunts- as she steps to the side and then through the dust- blade held low as she swings for another crescent sweep.

"...Mudada."

She says it simply- as the bullets smash into her shoulder, rather than her neck.. and another sweep blurs out of the sand- parting it through the force of the blade as she steps forwards with a lazy grin.

Her sensory ability is minimal- but it's also all focused on this one woman who she's fighting... and it's more than enough for this kind of a thing, she's sure...

As rather than really aiming for anywhere precise, she just moves to try and swing for her foes side with a gleam in her eyes- swinging for her general location with the broad area of a Nodachi.

"HIYAA!"* - Sat Nov 14 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly... as she closes her eyes and breathes in, as she usually does in training.

"This is your ultimate technique, huh..? Then I'll show you mine!" She says with a roaring laugh- as she then steps forwards- opening her eyes as she brings the blade down.

It's sudden and it blurs- as the blade expands. It's width, it's length, it's girth and it's general size- her nodachi swells. She can't really know what her foe is about to do- and her eyes open wide as she brings the Nodachi down, a laugh on her lips...

As it expands and comes down with a monstrous sort of force, aimed for her foes right shoulder as she brings it straight down.

"Come on! Do what you can!" She says- as a spectral figure seems to be pulling the blade straight down into the other womans body.* - Sat Nov 14 06:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) freezes as her blade hits the ground- what she blames the Tornado of sand on... and breathes in, then out. The spray of blood from her foes wounded arm excites her- but then she see's it, coming out of the mist.

It's not a figure with a real face, or a shape. It's a black figure in the general shape of a man- horns curling from it's head, and a lazy smile. Then it's a short man, hobbling along on a cane with the same lazy smile- no eyes, just a grin.

Then it's a man from her childhood. She recognizes him. She recognizes him as the reason she fled her home. She see's it- that thing she fears most. It's many things- but at the end of the day, it has one face. The man. That man. 

She's frozen for a long moment- as the sand dissapitates. As she hears the womans screams- and rememebrs how she screamed, when she was a little girl.

She remembers her father- and she screams. It's a howl of pain and rage. It's a feral scream- barely human, almost animalistic. She steps past the woman at her feet- barely even registering her opponent anymore, trapped completely in the illusion- as the figment of her father laughs, and she howls- ripping her blade from the ground into a thrust for his stomach- only for the illusion to sidestep. The sand she kicks up gets into Nina's wounds, almost guaranteed...

But at the same time- she isn't being attacked at all... Nina is ignored in favor of her Illusory creation- as the blade stabs up into her darkest fears stomach- then sweeps to try and slice through it.

And that scream doesn't stop, as the Genjutsu holds her tight, her blade whizzing through the air where the illusion seemed to stand.* - Sat Nov 14 07:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) continues to panic- pupils dilating as her blade continues to rip through the air- again and again as she steps forwards- screaming on and on in horror and pain as she attacks the hallucination. It eventually stops, however..

And she drops to her knees- sobbing as her blade fades away into so much smoke- heaving for air as she coughs and almost seems to choke- not out of physical pain, but simple.. .emotion.

On her hands and knees, she is shaking- confused and in mental pain.

"I... my god... what... what in the hells... what was that... how did you.. I saw.." She is murmuring.

Apparently, Genjutsu was super effective.* - Sat Nov 14 07:33:07 2015

She's still splattered with Nina's blood from the spar, and the single blow that landed... but she's smiling faintly as she looks the Kazekage in the eye- and begins to explain.

"So I'll start simple. Yes, I am a Sunagakure Shinobi. I trained in the academy, I have lived here for a few years, and I am loyal to this village. I swear that- but I must admit somethin, to explain a few things." She says calmly.

"See, my proffession is not what I put on the test- Kenjutsu. I'm uh.. I'm a Necromancer, Kazekage. That's why I wanted to be the person to execute that one guy- so I could devour his soul for my practicing of the dark arts. I can swear my loyalty to this village is honest- and that I don't really have any wierd curses or anything, I just eat peoples souls when I kill them. I feel it's best that I tell you this, so that I don't get in trouble later down the line for keeping it a secret, Aight?"* - Sat Nov 14 07:45:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: That's an error of logical judgement, more 'n anything. - Sat Nov 14 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: My self control is fine- had I wanted to restrain my blow, I could have. Easily. - Sat Nov 14 08:14:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Error in judgement, not self control. - Sat Nov 14 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: A lapse of judgement, a lack of self control. It's virtually the same. It's how one views it. - Sat Nov 14 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Not... really, no. I was in perfect control until that Genjutsu hit. - Sat Nov 14 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: In this situation, I could say you didn't have enough situational control to properly judge your actions. I can also say you failed to properly judge her. However, at the end of the day, this situation requires one to think back and learn. - Sat Nov 14 08:18:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) waves goodbye.* - Sat Nov 14 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks out into the arena- and breathes in. 

Forming her soul-devouring soul-sword is easier by the day- and it is with a practiced ease that she calls her Nodachi to hand. She breathes in as she holds it to the side, and begins to walk herself through Kata using the blade...

Soon it's a swift slash- a blurring crescent moon before she steps forwards and breathes, holding the blade high and pausing for a moment.

"....Shit, I'm going to miss Yan.." She murmurs, as she brings it down smoothly, stepping through the usual steps as she muses on her freind who, sadly, seems to have left her alone...

"... Like, who will I hang out with now..?" She muses onwards..* - Sat Nov 14 11:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs wearily- as she lifts the blade above her head- before expanding it, and slamming it down to the earth with a crushing blow- the extended length of the Nodachi leaving a cloud of dust that rises from the sand...

"...That guy was like... god, this is sad... that guy was really.. the best freind I ever had, wasn't he..?" She muses sadly, as she lets the blade fade rather than lifting it from the ground in that state.* - Sat Nov 14 11:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) breathes in again- as she once more conjures the blade at her side- frowning sadly as she focuses her soul and energy into the shape of a blade once more- only to sweep it with a monstrous speed forwards as she steps forwards... and breathes in, as she focuses on the blade in her hand.

"....Fuck. This is why I say that getting attached is a bad idea, before I do it anyway." She says softly- sadness filling her heart as she shakes her head.

"Bah... I don't have the time for this shit.... I'll miss the fucker, but I'll move on..." She insists to herself, as she lifts the blade and breathes.* - Sat Nov 14 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) let's the blade fade for a brief moment, as she lifts her hands above her head... then reforms it. 

"I'll just keep hacking my way forwards through life... yeah. I'll survive... even if my freinds do die everytime I make one.. I'll just make more to replace them." She hollowly lies to herself- fully aware that nothing will fill the growing void in her heart.

Her blade expands, and she brings it down. Yuudai's soul screams... and she relishes that pain.

"...Tch..."* - Sat Nov 14 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces... as she rips the blade up in a vicous arc out of the sand as it shrinks back down- halfway spinning her body into the arc of the slash as she pivots on a heel, pouring her emotions over the man abandoning her into her training.

"And really! How dare he! How /dare/ he leave like that- with no care for what he's leaving behind, off to settle a score with a man he admited was no sinner..." She snarls... then sighs, as she shakes her head.

"Nevermind that I'd have gladly done the same in his shoes... Tch." She snarls- as she once more expands the blade and brings it down a few moments later- her training growing more intense by the moment.

"...Damn that Idiiot!"* - Sat Nov 14 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts, as she once more rips it free of the ground in an upwards arc- a blurring diagonal crescent of Nodachi as it shrinks back to normal size, and she grimaces.

"...Meanwhile, here I am, getting worked up over a corpse. God, I am pathetic, aren't I? Ugh... are my emotions so weak..? Is my heart so.... overbearing..?" She grimaces- before she pauses mid-swing.

"...Wait. Am I.. am I fucking ANGSTING?" She growls out- tensing her grip around the blade after a full minute of thought.

"AM I ANGSTING OVER THAT SHIT?! HOLY FUCK- THAT PISSES ME OFF!" She roars- as she expands the blade, draws on the tormented, trapped soul of Yuudai, and expands her blade- crashing it down into the ground.

"Ugh... I need to calm myself down.."* - Sat Nov 14 11:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs, as she brings the blade upwards in her hands- an arc out of the sand as she shifts her grip into a two handed formation... breathing in, then out.

"....I need to center myself, and get a hold of my emotions... shit, I am glad I am out here alone when I do this." She says softly, as she then holds the blade close to her body- and regulates her breathing in an almsot meditive fashion.* - Sat Nov 14 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) breathes in... then out- as her meditiation goes on for a while, before leaving her centered as she lowers her blade to her side.. and nods.

".. Yeah. I'm stronger than that." She says softly- before stepping forwards.. planting a foot... and swinging her blade forwards through the air. It forms that crescent arc- and she breathes.

"This strains my arms... but I'm getting used to it.. I just have to keep practicing." She murmurs softly, as the blade pauses in the air, as she steps back...

And breathes in, then out.

"...Alright."* - Sat Nov 14 12:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) steps back... breathes in.. and nods.

"...Practice. Let the burn... push away the feelings." She murmurs softly to herself... as she then takes another step forwards. Breathes out....

Swings. Then breathes in. The blade forms that vicous crescent as she steps into it, before she lowers the tip to rest against the sand.

"Phew.." She murmurs softly, as she smiles gently.

"Better each time.."* - Sat Nov 14 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Hello. - Sat Nov 14 12:24:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh. - Sat Nov 14 12:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: You've gotten better? - Sat Nov 14 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's gone pretty well, yeah. - Sat Nov 14 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Care for a rematch? - Sat Nov 14 12:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Sure. - Sat Nov 14 12:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Then step on into the ring, heh. - Sat Nov 14 12:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) breathes in- then breathes out.. as she does something unusual- unusual for her, anyway.

She forms her blade from the start of the match- dark purple chakra forming into her hands and focusing itself into a blade- her Nodachi called from the start of the fight. She smiles lazily at Kurt, as she takes her stance and posture.

"I've been working on some new moves, too. Show me yours, a'right?" She says with a lazy smile- as she focuses her recently gained sensory abilities on him... and then breathes in, focusing.* - Sat Nov 14 12:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) traces his movements. Not with her eyes- but by feeling his chakra as it moves. As he slides towards her side... she grips her Nodachi.. and twists her entire body as she flicks her wrists...

It's a simple action on her part- one that places actual strain on her arms... as her blade becomes a crescent moon of motion- cutting of his uppercut by flowing into his body from the side- forcing him to either abandon the attack for a full dodge...

Or accept a blow from that monstrous weapon through his side as his own lands- the blade having become a purple blur of motion in that second- as she grins at him widely.

"Heh.... I'm not so slow, anymore.."* - Sat Nov 14 12:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles as her initial blow is evaded skillfully.... and then his fist lands against the side of her head. However- due to positioning.. it's just not going to launch her airborne- not like an uppercut to the jaw would have, no. It hurts- but she barely feels it, somehow... as she throws her body into him in response, kicking of the ground to tackle him with her side as his fist skids across her thick skull... a chuckle on her lips as her blade is held to the side.

"Not a bad thought... and I can feel em, now. You been workin out?" She teases as her bodyslam is impending towards his body.* - Sat Nov 14 12:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles... as he jumps above her... and she halts her motion as she catches nothing- planting her feet once more as he leaps into the air.. and her blade, which had shifted back to her side after the initial failed strike... arcs diagonally up to catch him just before he hits the ground- at the very end of his arc of momentum.

It's a long blade- and they are in close as she steps back while swinging it. It's a blurring arc of purple, intended to simply abort his plans before he can alter course upon hitting the ground- hoping to perhaps, even cut of him fully activating the gates.

Her blade moves quickly, then- and hungrily, as that dark metal cuts through the air in a broad crescent on an intercept course.* - Sat Nov 14 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Phew. - Sat Nov 14 12:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: That was close. - Sat Nov 14 12:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces as his blade whips down to stop hers from bisecting him, and he then launches back. She grimaces as she adjusts her posture- staring at him from the short distance between them.... as she lifts her blade up above her head- and breathes in. She stares at him, and crooks an eyebrow.

"So you feel the need to go all out from the start, all of a sudden..? What's with popping those gates so quick, eh?" She teases....

And then she's moving forwards- and it's another wide arc- this one a diagonal. The long, sweeping nature of a strike with a Nodachi limits the area available to dodge once more- as her blade swings through the air towards him in another broad crescent- a gleam in her eyes.

"It's really kind of annoying, y'know."* - Sat Nov 14 12:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles.. as her blade pauses against his... and as they clash- she steps forwards to change her slash, into a thrust- halting hte crescent halfway to thrust her blade inwards as she presses against his- moving for a thrust through his guard, into his chest- using the longer length of her blade to slide past while still occupying his in the clash.

"Tch."* - Sat Nov 14 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles as her blade twists in the air after he pushes it aside... her posture shifting as she lifts it up- already past his guard in length, if not in actual positioning, she reverses the blade so that the edge is still facing him- though backwards, technically, due to her grip... lifts.. and then in the act of bringing her hands back to her starting posture, sweeps a diagonal down from near his shoulder- grinning.

"Defense doesn't suit you."* - Sat Nov 14 13:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly... as she steps forwards- while reversing the sword back into her initial grip, and lifting it up... and pursuing him as he moves- showing a suprising jump in speed from their last battle- as she dashes forwards and brings the blade down- expanding it as she makes another diagonal sweep.

"We're rather at a standstill. I can't go any higher without risking a lethal blow that is silly difficult to avoid, and.."* - Sat Nov 14 13:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly- then nods as she leans back and breathes in, slowly... shifting her posture.

"Is that so..? Then you'd better go back on the offensive soon, if you want to win." She teases him as she leans back onto her heels.

"It's funny.. you can't hurt me without entering those. But you run out of energy so quickly when you use em, huh?"* - Sat Nov 14 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ...Mrm... - Sat Nov 14 13:17:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) dismisses her weapon in a flow of purple light, chuckling softly.* - Sat Nov 14 13:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: So, Would you like to do something else? - Sat Nov 14 13:18:43 2015

Or...Maybe I am, but I wouldn't know. I'm quite a pacifist.....Sigh-- Sorry, I'm a little strange. Not used to having a student or anything, you know? Anyway...The cost would be a one time fee of two thousand. Is that okay, or should we both find a more reasonable price? - Sat Nov 14 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Sure, two thousand is fine. Let's head out to the arena. YOu want me to show you what I can do by sparrin someone else, or by just doin Kata or somethin? - Sat Nov 14 22:23:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: They're not really good for sword practice...Maybe a ceremony at best. But---Your weapon, I guess. But if I see you having some sort of struggle with it, or the Katana is better suited or WHATEVER other weapon, you're changing to the said weapon. - Sat Nov 14 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh.... I guess I'll show you what I meant, when it comes to the fight. Still... anyway. Now I need someone to spar? - Sat Nov 14 22:33:23 2015

"Don't hold back. Against me, you can't afford to." She states firmly- as she stretches out- her supple form straining against her robes as she yawns- before raising her hands to the sky..

And forming her blade as she brings it down to her usual kendo stance, grinning laxly.

"Come on. Show me what you're capable of, freind." She states firmly- as she steps to the side, blade held two handed- but not yet making any offensive move as she settles her senses onto her foe.* - Sun Nov 15 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) begins to shift to the side as her opponent is swinging. The blade catches her on the shoulder as she shifts- and skids across her shoulder like before- a lazy smile on Mitsunara's face as it seems she's grown yet more durable since last time, just as her foe has grown yet slightly stronger... still.

She actually reacts to this blow- grunting as she's forced to turn her body to the side, before her own blade counterattacks in a low sweep for her foes waist.

It's not restrained- but she's holding the Nodachi backwards to strike with the blunt back of the blade, rather than the sharp edge- the flat sweeping through the air to slam into her side if she doesn't carefully avoid even as she steps back- using her blade against her foes side as a lever to deftly push herself back.

"Heh.."* - Sun Nov 15 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at the other womans movements... as her blade is moved by the other womans own... and then she shifts her posture- halting it's movement by locking it against Chikyu's with sheer brute force.

"Heh... not bad." She admits calmly- as the edge shifts closer to her own body... and she nods apreciatively.

"You're pretty good, I won't disagree... you've gotten better.... but check out this." She says- as in the clash... she shifts herself to the side and presses against her foes blade...  using her height advantage to press down...

Before then expanding her blade to ensure she wins the clash of strength- stepping forwards to press her blade down against the other womans blade then into her shoulder- a grin on her lips as a spectral figure frames her blade as she does it.

"Not bad, right?"* - Sun Nov 15 03:28:38 2015
