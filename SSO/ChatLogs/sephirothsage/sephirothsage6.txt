<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: There's no one in this village above a Genin left, I think. - Tue Oct 27 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah not since Hana died. - Tue Oct 27 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm fucking pissed off with the Hokage. - Tue Oct 27 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Couldn't even be here for that. - Tue Oct 27 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, no kidding.. - Tue Oct 27 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Hell, are there even any other Genin than us? - Tue Oct 27 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't know or care. - Tue Oct 27 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: We don't need any other mother fucker. - Tue Oct 27 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Maybe we don't as individuals, but... if we're attacked right now, surrender is pretty much our only option against any kind of military. - Tue Oct 27 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Then we'll just surrender or go to another village. - Tue Oct 27 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....It's a shame, really, what's happened to Konoha.. - Tue Oct 27 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: We got blown up. - Tue Oct 27 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Our last two hokage died. - Tue Oct 27 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Zeus is missing in action. - Tue Oct 27 22:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hana died. - Tue Oct 27 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: That's what happened. - Tue Oct 27 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah.. no kidding. - Tue Oct 27 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, leaning back against the fence with a frown and her hands in her pockets.

"Tch... is there a point in just the two of us staying here, even, you think..? I love this place, and.." She trails of and sighs, shaking her head. "... Nah. We've gotta stay, long as we can. There might not be other Shinobi here- but there are still loads of civilians to worry about, and if we ditch the place... who knows what'll happen."* - Tue Oct 27 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't really care what happens to them honestly. - Tue Oct 27 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: They have to make their own way in the world, just like you and I. - Tue Oct 27 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Mrm. But helping others is the entire point of becoming a Shinobi, you know. - Tue Oct 27 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's our job, pretty much. - Tue Oct 27 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Not always. - Tue Oct 27 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I mean, I don't help anyway. - Tue Oct 27 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I just do my jobs and get money. - Tue Oct 27 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .... - Tue Oct 27 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, closing her eyes and frowning.

"What a shitty position to be in.."* - Tue Oct 27 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: There has to be something to do... has to be. - Tue Oct 27 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrn... for now, I guess, I may as well just get back to training.. - Tue Oct 27 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: We were going to do a festival but Hana was sorting that out. - Tue Oct 27 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't really feel like following that up. - Tue Oct 27 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nothing really to celebrate now, is there.. - Tue Oct 27 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Obviously not. - Tue Oct 27 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: As for training, good luck. - Tue Oct 27 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I haven't trained in a while, I don't really see the point. - Tue Oct 27 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: If we're not strong, in this world, we'll die. - Tue Oct 27 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That's the point, to me. - Tue Oct 27 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't really mind if I die. - Tue Oct 27 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .... - Tue Oct 27 22:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, clenching her fists- the apathy and general hopelessness of this places atmosphere starting to get to /her/, much as her showing her displeasure seems to be annoying /him/.

"...That's an awful way to think, you know."* - Tue Oct 27 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: It's a realistic way to think. - Tue Oct 27 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: No, it's giving up. - Tue Oct 27 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Saying you don't care if you die? Thinking like that? That just makes your death all the more likely. - Tue Oct 27 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You won't survive if you don't /want/ to survive. You won't get anywhere in life if you don't /want/ to get there. - Tue Oct 27 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: This.. apathetic hopelessness, just hampers you. - Tue Oct 27 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, tilting her head back.

"If you don't care, there's no reason to not just go drown yourself right now, you know. Life's not worth living if you don't care about anything." She says simply, shrugging.* - Tue Oct 27 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Because dying for no point would be wasteful. - Tue Oct 27 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: At least being alive means i'm worth something. - Tue Oct 27 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: And besides, I tried that before remember? - Tue Oct 27 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Living for no reason would be wasteful as well. I suggest you find a goal, something to care for. - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You stopped me from burning the mansion down. - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Something...to care for..? - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And if you don't find something to live for, you'll just keep finding yourself back there... - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Crying until you kill yourself. - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It doesn't have to be a person, or anything like that. - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Something...TO CARE FOR!? - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But a goal- something to want, something to live for. - Tue Oct 27 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Fuck you, you haven't been listening at all. - Tue Oct 27 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Hrhngh. Anything can set off this damn nutcase, can't it? - Tue Oct 27 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Why should I care for anyone anymore? - Tue Oct 27 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You're simply wrong. Continuing to think the way you are now, will only cause you more pain in the long run, and eventually kill you in a wasteful, meaningless fashion. - Tue Oct 27 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? I didn't say a person. - Tue Oct 27 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Fine, Why should I care for anything? - Tue Oct 27 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You can care about goals, about dreams. About causes, about desires. - Tue Oct 27 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Everything leads to pain one way or the other. - Tue Oct 27 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Because if you don't, your life is meaningless. Because if you decide you want to never feel pain- you'll shortly find that you'll never feel joy, either. - Tue Oct 27 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm just cutting that pain out now. - Tue Oct 27 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: If you avoid investing, avoid caring, avoid /trying/, all you'll be is a meaningless heap of shit incapable of joy, pain, or anything more than a dull, pathetic, meaningless apathy. - Tue Oct 27 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Good. - Tue Oct 27 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: That's what I want. - Tue Oct 27 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'll go through life with barely any friends and no family or lovers. - Tue Oct 27 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Hrmph. So you're still giving up. - Tue Oct 27 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Giving up? - Tue Oct 27 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Maybe I should have just killed him... - Tue Oct 27 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: No. - Tue Oct 27 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I still live for myself. - Tue Oct 27 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That's exactly what you just described. - Tue Oct 27 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: But for others or an ideal? - Tue Oct 27 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: No. - Tue Oct 27 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Theres just no point, It'll just hurt when they eventually die or your ideals fail. - Tue Oct 27 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Don't you even have any kind of goal? - Tue Oct 27 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: No. - Tue Oct 27 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Should I? - Tue Oct 27 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Tch. - Tue Oct 27 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: There's no point continuing this, I suppose. - Tue Oct 27 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Obviously not. - Tue Oct 27 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I understand why you're doing this. - Tue Oct 27 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: It's because you care, you want me to care too. - Tue Oct 27 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Theres no point doing that with me. - Tue Oct 27 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You're a good person Ketsuki, Hold onto that if you want. - Tue Oct 27 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: For me? - Tue Oct 27 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'll be neither good nor bad. - Tue Oct 27 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'll simply survive, Like i've been doing. - Tue Oct 27 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, gesturing for Hideyoshi to go past her with a slight frown.

"...Alright then. Survive without meaning or purpose. Good luck, I suppose.."* - Tue Oct 27 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Yeah. - Tue Oct 27 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yo.. Kyu, right? - Tue Oct 27 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I don't suppose you'd be open to joining me on the training field? My Sensei's are both dead, and my only remaining comrade Genin is an elementalist; I got no one to train with. - Tue Oct 27 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Guess not. - Tue Oct 27 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I am the Captain now.  - Tue Oct 27 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Time to kill you and take control. - Tue Oct 27 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: -omit- - Tue Oct 27 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Time to Genjutsu you and stab you while you cry over your dead mom. - Tue Oct 27 23:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Ketsuki. - Tue Oct 27 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Come here. - Tue Oct 27 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Tue Oct 27 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sup. - Tue Oct 27 23:38:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs- and smiles gently, staring at him with hands in her pockets.

"...I understand. It hurts right now, and I get what you mean. I can be patient, and wait."* - Tue Oct 27 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I just don't see a lot of point in anything...you know? - Tue Oct 27 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I mean, I've lost literally everything. - Tue Oct 27 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .. Yeah. - Tue Oct 27 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I just don't need friends or family right now. - Tue Oct 27 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: And I honestly feel like I just want to go through life alone. - Tue Oct 27 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I realise that no matter how strong you become, you will always lose people. - Tue Oct 27 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I just don't want to feel that anymore. - Tue Oct 27 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I know thats wrong to say, I really do. - Tue Oct 27 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: But I just...can't...not again. - Tue Oct 27 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .....Well. - Tue Oct 27 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Even if you don't care.. - Tue Oct 27 23:53:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I just don't want to be told 'it all gets better' over and over. - Tue Oct 27 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: It doesn't. - Tue Oct 27 23:56:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh. - Tue Oct 27 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Think that much of your wisdom, huh? - Tue Oct 27 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Not really. - Tue Oct 27 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I just feel i've been through enough to have a better understanding of it. - Tue Oct 27 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Anyway, I'll speak no more of it. - Tue Oct 27 23:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) shrugs at that.

"Desperate measures. Still- I'll avoid it, definitly. Unless you try to kill me again, you won't see it again."* - Wed Oct 28 00:07:15 2015

"Of course, Ai.. Hrm.." She turns to look at Toudou. "You mentioned being open to company, yeah? I haven't had a mission in a while.. though admitably, I'm a Genin. What rank would you call what you're off on- I wouldn't mind coming along for the ride."* - Wed Oct 28 00:49:55 2015

"Well.. I like reading stories, y'know? And.. if I'm like, totally honest? I really enjoy my workout sessions.

She sighs, trailing of as she frowns and finishes the cookie.

"....Mrm. But, yeah. I enjoy reading.. spending time with my boyfreind.. workin out.. and fighting."* - Wed Oct 28 03:53:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grins eagerly at that... then nods.

"Right! Cool, I'll lead the way to the Konoha training field then, yeah? I'm sure you're probably a good deal better than me, but.. well, how else am I 'gonna learn, yeah? Heh. I look forward to this!" She says cheerily, as she starts to jog down the road with a broad grin.* - Wed Oct 28 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Mind if I join you two? - Wed Oct 28 04:24:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You... okay? - Wed Oct 28 04:24:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Alright. - Wed Oct 28 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's go. - Wed Oct 28 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Ohh god... is he taking /this/ as an insult too..? - Wed Oct 28 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: So uh. - Wed Oct 28 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I guess you can start. - Wed Oct 28 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Oh, he wants to see what I can do. - Wed Oct 28 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods calmly- smiling faintly as she clasps her hands together to bow in respect... then while she's fully bowed down, as she rises from the humble gesture.. she's already forming the two handseals nesascary for her primary Jutsu.

Black leaves fall around her foe, as she smiles gently; those leaves acting as the trigger for a Genjutsu as she reaches to draw her Tanto from her back, and assume a stance.

"Right, I'm ready!"* - Wed Oct 28 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs. She frowns at the man recognizing her Genjutsu before it fully triggers, even as she draws her Tanto. She doesn't own anything bigger; even though she knows it's not a real sword, she simply has no means to get a hold of anything bigger... unfortunately. She crouches down as her foe steps forward, then lunges forwards just as the Genjutsu finishes; the leaves dispersing to show Toudou whatever his deepest fear is..

First, a testing sweep with the tanto; a high diagonal, as she laments the shortness of the blade and wishes she had a real damn sword of actual use...

Even as her left hand pulls a Kunai free, with intent to slash at his left leg as she steps in towards him; a grimace visible on her face.
* - Wed Oct 28 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces. She, meanwhile, wasn't expecting a foe who professed a desire to be a great elementalist, to be this fast and strong. She pivots with her stroke; but she's just not as fast as her opponenet; and more importantly, her speed is purely offensive, some might say... as she steps to follow through her attack, stepping into where her foe was, rather than were he is...as she pivots to face him...

And takes a backhand to the face, staggering back with a grimace as she braces herself. Still- it stings.. it definitly hurts- but she's not badly damaged by it.. a grin on her lips as she shifts and rolls in the pivot; on the back of her heels...

Before she lunges back in, this time with a thrust of the Tanto aimed for her foes wrist as it retracts from his attack, even as she flings her Kunai; actually throwing it in point blank range for the mans gut as she makes her thrust with the tanto; a grin on her lips.

"Hah! Shit, I wasnt' expecting /this/!" She says eagerly as she steps into the blow, having rolled into it suprisingly well.* - Wed Oct 28 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) flies like team rocket doe.* - Wed Oct 28 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) steps through the air as he once more dodges her strokes without real visible effort; grimacing at the mans flowing movements. She isn't fast enough to dodge his movements- just barely begining to do so when the blows land, one after another.

She coughs- eyse widening as she does her best to simply roll with the hits. The jab hits her cheek- and turns her head to the side, sending her stumbling back as she spits out a tooth, eyes wide; before the blow to her shin sends her down to the ground in a blurring movement. She groans from there.. but she also isn't done. She grimaces- as she tenses against the ground, coughing as she pushes herself up slightly with her free hand, her other holding the tanto steady.

"Tch... and you're definitly.. not a pure elementalist." She grimaces... as she tenses against the ground; and performs the exact opposite of one of her usual techniques.

"DYNAMIC EXIT!" She cries- as she kicks of the ground to throw herself /away/ from her foe.* - Wed Oct 28 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces. She nods as the man speaks- but her grin fades as he begins to form a handseal. As he slams his hand down into the ground- she takes a gamble. She see's the flames form... blindingly fast, to her eyes.. but she also see's that they are on the ground.

She simply prays he can't manipulate them, as she crouches for a moment, before launching herself in a jumping kick towards his face- leaping over the flames surrounding her on the ground, by simply jumping higher than they reach in her flying kick to his jawline, blade held in one hand, other hand out to her side...

And foot first!

"SHIT SHIT SHIT SHITTTT!"* - Wed Oct 28 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) snarls as he catches her attack on his arm; intending to brace against his leg to throw herself back...

Intending to use his arm as a post to jump away from him as he parries.. but then, as per usual; he's just too fast for her, as his left snaps out and grabs her leg. She grimaces- as he begins to rotate with her held... and as she crouches inwards to ball herself up; grimacing as she passes through the heat of the flames, but suprisingly enough.. enduring that Jutsu with suprisingly little damage beyond her clothes catching fire...

She stabs into his left arm with the Tanto, as he's about to release her- a two handed thrust as she balls up into a crouch to be able to reach... as he lets go of her just as the blade is being driven in; her hope to stab him as he's about to throw her.

"I'm.. not just some pushover!" She squeeks out- as she either misses, and flies to the grind to have the wind knocked out of her by the impact; likely coughing raggedly for a few...

Or latches on by the blade, possibly causing a lot of pain in this supposedly freindly spar.* - Wed Oct 28 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) rolls on the ground, grimacing as she holds tight to her tanto- edge away from herself to avoid rending ehrself apart as she rolls on the ground, coughing raggedly from the pain of her impact...

As the hardy little girl then shifts.. to start to pull herself up, waveringly, into a standing position. She coughs a few times- then heaves a sigh of relief.

"Thanks for makin me stop drop and roll... the heat was gettin pretty bad 'fore all that rollin put it out, yeah?" She teases- wavering from side to side, unsteady from a mix of pain and exhaustion; her entire body, by this point, is sore and in pain... and she's starting to feel slightly tired, even...

But she's not done yet; still standing, she draws herself up.. and grimaces.. as she reaches into her coat for something.

"What I'm real glad about though, is that the fire didn't set of all my tags.." She teases idly.. as she sheathes the Tanto with her other hand, reaching for a Kunai instead as she braces herselfe..* - Wed Oct 28 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) yelps audibly as she see's her foe throw his chakram. As he is reaching for it, she's slapping a tag to her Kunai. As he's gathering the fire before throwing one... she's throwing the Kunai with the tag on it, aimed at her foes feet to offset and unsettle him...

As she is twisting to the side... before being throwin back by a chakram's flat to the gut. She let's out an oof of pain, as she crumples to the ground; finished by that powerful strike, and in a suprising amount of pain- left barely conscious, as she groans aloud from the ground- shucking her coat in the motion.

The burns aren't so bad; but the physical pain is immense and suprising to her, as she curls up and grimaces; having trouble breathing for a few moments after having the air knocked out of her- as she silently heaves.* - Wed Oct 28 05:38:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) slowly pushes herself up, clutching her gut with one hand as she leans back and sighs.

"...Ugh... a sparring match, 's what." She groans out, rubbing her stomach in pain. "Tch.. man, after a hit like that.. feel like I'm gonna be sick.."* - Wed Oct 28 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks at the question, rubbing the back of her head as she smiles gently- then shrugging.

"Sorry, I don't really know who that is. Got a description, ma'am? Not too many people in Konoha lately, but.. I mightt be able to help? Probably not, but.." She shrugs.* - Wed Oct 28 05:46:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) waves goodbye.* - Wed Oct 28 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) finally decides to sit down with the scroll her lover gave her on that 'Shunshin' Jutsu; and humming gently, she unfurls it and begins to read up on the theory of the technique, at first; starting with the basics of the technique.

The basic concept is interesting to begin with; a high speed movement technique, with varying special effects linked to it based on individual skill and preference. The notes about extreme physical toll on the body of the user are worrying; but the fact that training and experience can mitigate those soothes that momentary fear.

She's fully confident in her bodies ability to handle a technique like this, of course; but her chakra control is what worries her. She's off course been working on it; the leaf exercise a daily practice for her at this point... but her progress in chakra has been slow compared to her physical training. It's a momentary concern and distraction that she soon dismisses in favor of directing her attention back to the scroll, fully.

"Yes.. very interesting indeed.." The studious young Shinobi murmurs, as she reads into the exact nature of the technique; the Tiger seal initially required for focus, but supposedly eventually dismissed by true masters... interesting indeed...* - Wed Oct 28 23:58:17 2015

"Hrm? Alright. Good luck on your trip, Takeda. Be safe, alright..? If you want, I could come with you to watch your back?"* - Wed Oct 28 23:59:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: A Katana, definitly. - Thu Oct 29 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Alright, I'll see you soon. - Thu Oct 29 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Good luck on your trip! - Thu Oct 29 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) eventually, sets aside the scroll; rolling it back up and sliding it into her backpack with the rest of her belongings... and takes a deep, calming breath; now for the moment of truth; will the Jutsu work?

It's worth trying at least. She breathes in, as she sets her target; just a little outside of her normal reach of a sprint; as she braces herself for movement... breathing in deeply as she readies herself to simply.. /move/.

"I've got this.. I can do this.." She murmurs to herself; gathering her chakra roughly- her poor control hampering her first use of the Jutsu, as she requires much more chakra to utilize it than normal; wasting most of what she draws on... but at the same time..

She directs it downwards- otuwards. She feels herself almost vibrating- and then she lunges forwards.

It's a perfectly straight motion, at least; and it leaves her panting a few feet away from where she started, swaying about dizzily.

"Aha... Hahn.."* - Thu Oct 29 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: -- Oh, Toudou. - Thu Oct 29 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: There the hell you are. - Thu Oct 29 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) waves as she walks up from behind him, tucking her hands into her pockets.

"Sup?"* - Thu Oct 29 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Oh. - Thu Oct 29 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Hey, Ketsuki. - Thu Oct 29 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I've just been deciding where I should look next. - Thu Oct 29 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Do you have any clues? - Thu Oct 29 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) strokes her chin, thinking.

"Did you search Ame without me? Or Iwa..? Other than that.. do you know about any places off the beaten road, or like.. any mines?" She inquires, scratching her chin. "Sorry, I was training most of today, rather than researching- although.. it's born some real fruit- check this out!" She says- her childish eagerness shining forth..

As she forms a Tiger seal, crouches- and then in a sudden, blurring movement, is a good number of feet away; grinning proudly as she sways almost dizzily for a moment.

"Hah.. got the hang of this shit."* - Thu Oct 29 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But.. yeah. - Thu Oct 29 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Just- think about places you know exist, but you haven't looked at, y'know? - Thu Oct 29 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I haven't searched anywhere since. - Thu Oct 29 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: I think I know of a couple of beaten off roads though. - Thu Oct 29 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Granted, I don't want to take the time & energy to go on a useless search in folly. - Thu Oct 29 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: We need informatio. - Thu Oct 29 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Right, so the question is, where do we ga- Hrm? - Thu Oct 29 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: A person? - Thu Oct 29 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) turns at the girl walking up besides her, and smiles broadly. She waves at Saeza; smiling with a disarming gentleness and open warmth.

"Ohaiyo! Nice to meetcha, welcome to Konoha! What brings you here, Miss?" She asks brightly; a warmth and kindness pervading her tone as she shifts to face the other woman.* - Thu Oct 29 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I'm here to buy things and to check on people. - Thu Oct 29 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah! I'm Ketsuki, you are? I'd be more than happy to help yah. - Thu Oct 29 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I heard Konoha was..I don't know..Not doing well. Everyone was like hiding last I was here. - Thu Oct 29 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm.. ? Ah... - Thu Oct 29 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That's a way to put it, yeah. - Thu Oct 29 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I'm Saeza! I want to buy things like..Kenjutsu and Taijutsu and Ninjutsu! For Lady Marrisa. - Thu Oct 29 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: A lot of people are dead...... - Thu Oct 29 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Thu Oct 29 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You mean, you want to buy supplies and weapons, yeah? - Thu Oct 29 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Nope! Jutsu scrolls! I'm paying lots of money for them. - Thu Oct 29 05:05:29 2015
