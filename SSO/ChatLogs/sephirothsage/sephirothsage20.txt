"Drink, huh..? Hit me with..... Hrm. Sake, four parts sake six parts water." She says calmly- before looking towards Yan and stretching. "I've got practice later, can't be too drunk- but a little buzz 'd be nice. So... how was your trip?"* - Mon Nov 16 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly as she listens to him explain. She listens attentively and patiently- a gentle smile on her lips.

"I see... so I suppose this was an agreed on duel, if he knew you where coming.... " She muses softly- before turning to smile at the Server.

"Chicken- not fried, but broiled. Whatever kind of sauce you like- and on the side, a noodle dish of whatever kind, along with egg-flower soup." She requests succinctly- before looking back to Yan. "And you?"* - Mon Nov 16 05:54:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) is smiling gently, as she taps her glass against her comrades- smiling gently... 

Before blinking and lowering the glass as she looks at Kiyoko.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles at that and shakes her head.

"Nah. I won't get drunk- the Sake is watered down by a lot." She explains with a lazy smile. "It's less than half sake."* - Mon Nov 16 06:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as she leans back against the table- reaching to take a long hit of the Sake, and shaking her head.

"Yare Yare Daze.... Ivel, we're testin Aza... while we have dinner, apparently!" She says with a laugh- before looking at Aza and squinting.

"So, Nari know about this test- or is she just too high to care, like usual?" She inquires calmly- a lazy half smile on her face as she decides to join in on the 'testing'.* - Mon Nov 16 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Is the test so he doesn't die in a month? - Mon Nov 16 06:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) frowns at that, leaning back.

"Ah. I see- so you had horrible taste in chicks, got it. So she's not just too high to care- she's a filthy traitor whose head I'll be removing from it's whore shoulders if I ever see her pathetic ass again, got it." She says- with that same lazy smile still on his lips.

"I mean, if she left the village... Heh. I guess I can't even call her a person anymore, if she has no concept of loyalty, huh?"* - Mon Nov 16 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Uh apparently...she isn't a shinobi. - Mon Nov 16 06:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stares at him and chuckles.

"If you can't even keep a filthy whore with no loyalty, you don't have a chance in hell with me, boy. I've no interest in brainless mongrels who can't even hurt me properly when they turn into a rage-beast. Why, I'm sure if we fought without transforming, I wouldn't take a scratch from those puny arms, shithead." She says lazily- eyes agleam with a feral glee as she throws herself into ripping him a new one.

"Hell! I've fought more dangerous toddlers. Two, actually. You..? You just aren't my type. Come back and try again when you can at least give me a real fight using your /own/ strength, eh?" She teases- before shaking her head.

"Besides, I'm not interested in sloppy seconds from some traitor slut."* - Mon Nov 16 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..I think you are over doing it... - Mon Nov 16 06:36:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) she just grins faintly- looking at Aza.

"You're a real swarmy bastard when you're calm, huh?"* - Mon Nov 16 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: It's weird when he isn't mean. - Mon Nov 16 06:45:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) turns mid conversation to lazily drawl at Bryson.

"An Exorcism, huh..? Too bad there's no possession going on here, heh." She says lazily- before waving as Izanami walks up.

"Yo, Iza. How you been?"* - Mon Nov 16 08:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) waves Kiyoko off, laughing cheerfully at her words as she turns to look at Izanami and nods- forming her sword calmly. She does nothing speial with it- just forming the blade into her hands normally, Nodachi taking shape.

"A'right. Sword out."* - Mon Nov 16 08:09:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: necros and shinobi mating... i guess its possible - Mon Nov 16 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly- listening attentively.

"...You know, no one ever taught me water walking.. but that said- I do have pretty decent chakra control." She says with a faint smile- soaking in the womans words- then speaking softly.

"Now- how do I reach out to my fire natured Chakra. How do I... change the normal chakra, to fire chakra?" She inquires of Izanami- eyes narrowed as she looks at the younger girl with an intent focus- a blazing gleam in those eyes. It's perhaps suprising to the younger girl- to see an older woman so readily and attentively willing to accept teaching from a little girl.

"The rest of that makes sense- but the difference between fire chakra.. and normal chakra- I'm not sure. I have the affinity, but.."* - Mon Nov 16 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly- taking in the information and analyzing it. She thinks of how to heat up her chakra, first- how to do something like that with her own, very unusual chakra. That unique energy that enables so much, is at times also a hindrance in her case.. as she breathes in, and thinks.

"I see... heat it, huh..?" She murmurs softly- as she gathers chakra into her stomach. It swells and grows- expanding and revolving as she focuses on moving it around in there to heat it- friction causing heat as she focuses on the idea of heat.

It's slow- but eventually, the chakra is being converted at an extremely inefecient rate- as she pulls it up... from her stomach... to her arms.. into her hands....

And grimaces- as she tries to pour it into the blade- but nothing happens, at first- as she just sways a bit...

"..wait, shit- I just.. right... all I did there was.. Pour the energy into the blade.. Tsk.. I'll have to... alright, I've got generating the energy down- how do I wrap it around the blade and.. into flames?"* - Mon Nov 16 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) breathes in- and nods.

She breathes in- and flows her chakra steadily to her stomach... repeating her earlier steps- then invisioning the flames sworling around the blade- a tornado of flame around her purple Nodachi...

And after a long focus- it occurs. It flows and wraps the spectral blade- and she stares at the weak, flickering flames before they die out.

"..I think I get it.... sorta. It'll take a lot more practice before i'm done, but.."* - Mon Nov 16 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: hmm - Mon Nov 16 09:07:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins and holds out a hand.

"Do I owe you anythin, or?"* - Mon Nov 16 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly and looks at him with a faint smile.

"Sure, I can give you a closer look some other time."* - Mon Nov 16 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Good, good. - Mon Nov 16 20:09:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow at that, lounging back in the chair.

"I have no feeling's on people in /general/, really. Don't give a shit about people in any abstract sense- just the ones I care about, and my village as a concept, I suppose... though, the later is just out of a sense of debt."* - Mon Nov 16 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches back and thinks on that for a long moment- a thoughtful gleam in her eyes- and then she chuckles.

"It happens. Life, Death- just a cycle yo. I feed on it, almost- when I inflict it, I benefit. I don't wanna die myself- and I don't want my freinds to die... but the rest of the world can keep spinnin in the circle as it pleases."* - Mon Nov 16 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stares at him, and with a lazy smile- baldfaced lies to him with no hesitation.

"Yeah, of course."* - Mon Nov 16 20:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow at that.

"I see. So she's not a traitor whore- you betrayed the village by killing one of it's members for.. I presume minor anoyances." She taunts him calmly from across the table- a frown finding it's way onto her face.

"Well, I hope you at least hid the body properly." She says with a low sigh.* - Mon Nov 16 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) calmly nods at Aza- then speaks bluntly.

"Define Disposed of, Kid. If you fucked it up, someone'll eventually find the g'damn corpse- and then you're up shit creak without a paddle."* - Mon Nov 16 20:59:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says it in a light hearted, almost teasing tone- as if this entire discussion has had no emotional impact on her at all.* - Mon Nov 16 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles lowly as she leans back into her seat, crooking an eyebrow upwards.

"That so, huh..? Anyway.. I see. Well, that was interestin to find out.." She muses aloud, scratching her chin as she does. "...So. How you feelin, then?"* - Mon Nov 16 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) laughs softly and shrugs.

"I'm really not sure about me and Yan. We live together- but we're more like... room mates who hang out a lot. Dude is definitly my best freind- but I ain't sure about takin it that far... and dating isn't really a topic that concerns me too much. I can't have kids at all anyway, so.." She shrugs.

"No point to me in getting married or anything- and dating is just a way to get there. Besides- I don't have any strong feelings of that kind to motivate me into a relationship for illogical reasons, either."* - Mon Nov 16 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and nods.

"Oh, I do enjoy taking lives- you're right about that much. I exist mostly by feasting on the souls of those I slay- devouring the very existence of others to grow stronger. Let me clarify that... but at the same time..?" 

She chuckles softly- eyes agleam in the dim lighting of teh resturant. "What you did? Disgusts me. She may not have been loyal to this village, or pleasant. But it's clear she was loyal to you, if she wanted you to run away from a place that obviously has strong distaste for you. And you spat in that, let the rage take you- and threw away something I'd slaughter this entire village for- a chance at real, honest, love." She states- a certain vicous tone in her voice.

"No chance at the date- and I probably won't tell anyone about what you did... but I will be challenging you to a duel. To the first to give up, rather than the death, admitably."* - Mon Nov 16 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stares calmly across the table and sighs.

"I see. So you still can't control yourself in the transformation, just when you enter it." She states calmly, lounging back in the chair.

"A damn shame."* - Mon Nov 16 21:33:39 2015

"I'll go on a date- but to be fair.. don't expect anything to come of it- I really just don't care."* - Mon Nov 16 21:42:11 2015

"Mhrm, yeah." She says calmly, waving goodbye.* - Mon Nov 16 21:51:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins lazily- as she flicks her blade from it's sheathe and holds it in a left handed, single hand grip- holding the rather plain, normal Iron blade casually.

"So- you want the first step of the dance, or shall I?"* - Mon Nov 16 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? So I get the first step, huh..? - Mon Nov 16 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A'right, then... - Mon Nov 16 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins wide as she stands there, blade in hand....

Before she steps forwards- flowing past him, as she pivots on the spot to bring her blade towards his side in a graceful arc towards his midsection, as her other arm winds back and hangs at her waist- ready for something, though what isn't quite clear.

Her movement was fluid and graceful- suprisingly so, for such a large woman... but then- she has a certain elegance about her lean, muscular and curvy build.

"Let's dance, shall we?" She says lazily as that first sweep hones in, and her right arm hangs low.* - Mon Nov 16 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: nah, I'll get'em - Mon Nov 16 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Sanoke, after you're finished. C'mere. - Mon Nov 16 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: We must talk. - Mon Nov 16 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins at the mostly equal clash. Her blade presses against his own smaller weapon- a gleam in her eyes as sparks fly from the steel between them... a grin on her lips.

"Not too bad at all..." She says with a teasing laugh... as their blades press against each other briefly... and in the lock, she rotates her body- throwing her right hand forwards into his stomach as she guides the clash out to the side to keep his Tanto away from the strike with her other hand- as the clash breaks in that moment, in a curtain of sparks.

She's grinning wide as she launches the attack. Her blade breaking the lock with his in a curtain of sparks as her right hand lunges forth for a strike to her foes gut.

"And you're damn right I'm handy with a sword! Hah!"* - Mon Nov 16 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh..well..I-I'll just be as I am. - Mon Nov 16 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: 9so - Mon Nov 16 22:18:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: You may take the first strike. - Mon Nov 16 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright. - Mon Nov 16 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as he moves. His speed is something else, as far as she's concerned- and it makes one thing apparent. As per usual, she cannot really rely on her eyes to track her foes movement. Her minimal sensory abilities are focused entirely on Sanoke- as his strike manages to make her stagger as it strikes just slightly off target due to her movement- striking the back of her thigh and forcing her to step forwards- pushing her more into the strike.

As he glides away from that strike, she reverses her grip on the Katana in her left- and with a grin... she blurs it forwards. She's already flowing forwards- managing to roll with his blow to stay standing... as, from the direction he is fleeing towards... comes a sweeping crescent of blurring movement from her Katana.

It's suprisingly fast, it must be admited; a one handed stroke that is notably faster than her previous- almost immediate upon her begining movement, forming a crescent-moon like shape through the air...

Aimed for his midsection once more.

"Tch... why does everyone seem to focus on things like speed? Is it just to annoy me by being fast?" She says with a note of bitterness- clearly upset by now with the extreme speed of most everyone she fights...!* - Mon Nov 16 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces. The blow is fast- incredibly fast, compared to her earlier swings. She pivots on the ground, turning to face Sanoke with a gleam in her eyes as she plants her feet.

"And now, of course, you're up where I can't reach. Because no one ever taught me Suimen, and I have no idea how to get up there." She admits shamelessly- sighing.

"Besides, just jumping up at you would just get me stabbed in midair. Not cool. You gonna come down, or you done?" She inquires calmly- as she stabilizes her posture and plants her feet on the ground.* - Mon Nov 16 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly, brushing her right hand through her hair.

"Heh... yeah, I've never had a teacher of any kind since the academy, apart from Izanami-chan giving me this real nice scroll that I've yet to really get down pat... heh." She explains calmly- as she plants her feet against the ground and thinks for a moment.

"Anyway... so you want me to get serious, huh..? Well... I'll admit- apart from holding back one of my favorite techniques, I'm not really holding anything back. Like I said- everything I know.... is self taught!" She explains... as she rushes forwards- dropping her Katana mid charge as she brings both hands together.

It's unclear what she's doing- as she swings diagonally upwards with her hands clenched together- as if delivering a haymaker...

But she stops short- as a blade appears in her hands and suddenly, her reach is massively expanded. The blade rips forth- and moves in a blurring, wide arc. It's a Nodachi- formed out of the aether, her very soul poured into a weapon that cuts the air with a notably greater movement than before- currently headed up in a diagonal slash to his side.

"Step two, baby."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) leaps upwards, as the man begins to form handseals... a grin on her lips- the outpour of earth strikes low- as he chooses to dodge her initial attack by a Narrow Margin.

A poor choice- as the blade expands at the peak of it's arc- and comes crashing downwards, the weight, size, and length of the blade greatly increased as it comes down for a reversal of the initial strike.

She's airborne for a moment- before she lands in the mud regardless- having simply narrowly avoided the initial strike with her powerful legs projecting her upwards briefly....

And as she comes down- the blade does as well- in a gravity-fueled arc caused by it's suddenly massive width, length, and weight.

A spectral figure wrapped around the blade tugging it towards it's target as she grins.

"I know that technique.. just a little too well! Yan uses it against me all the time!" She notes- as the suddenly huge blade is coming down on Sanoke- and a good deal of the area behind him, as well- aimed straight for his shoulder.* - Mon Nov 16 22:59:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces as her blow is only narrowly avoided once more- as she attempts to keep pushing forwards- to turn the missed slash into a thrust as the blade begins to shrink back to normal after the attack...

But a handseal is formed; and a hail of spheres are launched. It's not her usual style to dodge- though her reflexes are far from poor, it's just not what she's good at quite yet- her body something she trusts implicitly to take most hits for her...

As the bullets impact- and drill into her body one after the other, pushing her back through sheer kinetic force- leaving impacts like hard punches rather than penetrating her body, as it is as if she was simply bombarbed by the invisible arms of some great monster.

She skids backwards, blade held low to her hips as she stares at her foe- a gleam in her eyes despite the intensity of the battle going on.

"Heh.... it's not half bad, that's for sure... but Ninjutsu continues to be a real pain for me... tch, wish I'd finished studying that Chakra Flow technique by now..." She muses idly- staring back at him for the brief pause in the battle his technique bought.* - Mon Nov 16 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) flows. She's not near as fast as him- but she's not exactly slow, either- as she darts to the side- and the blade in her hands forms it's own crescent- a much larger one, due to the larger weapon.

The wires flow forth- and she moves to have her blade meet them; a broad arc blurring through the air to cut them off in a curtain of steel- or, well.. as close to steel as her blade is- her eyes fixed forwards.

"Ah..? So you're into bondage, huh? I guess that's something you have Mirai do often, eh?" She teases- as she ducks forwards as her blade arcs- launching herself closer- though not reaching him quite yet as she dances forwards- a laugh on her lips and a gleam in her eyes.

"So, you done dancing already?"* - Mon Nov 16 23:27:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts at his blurring approach- unable to really react as she simply squats down to endure it- the kick landing against her side and leaving a bruise.... as the scroll unfurls the cloth for the real attack as she steps to the side- staring up at the cloth as her blade.. .is brought down as quickly as she can from the upwards position it was left in by rending the wires.

It's an attempt to cut into the cloth before it wraps her- to shred it... but sadly- it's unlikely she can move fast enough to do so... as once bound, she lets her blade fade into shadow.

"Tch.... damn, you really are into bondage, huh? Kinky." She teases from within the clothes binding.* - Mon Nov 16 23:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly- listening to what the man has to say.

"So, a trench for tryin it with water.." She murmurs- nodding slowly as she gathers energy in her stomach; forcing her chakra to flow properly for a moment. It leaves her feeling slightly ill, at first- but it's something she's growing more and more used to.

She turns and nods- watching what he did closely.

"Right.... so you form it as a barrier between your feet, and what you're stepping on- then shift it to make it... adhesive.. I see. I don't have too much chakra to work with, so.." She muses idly- before gathering her energy to her feet- and pressing them against the wall. The first is unsteady- but suprisingly, she is holding herself against it.... unsteadily, and her footing seems wobbly- but she is holding herself.

The other foot moves to join it, and she slips- seeming to fall down slowly from the wall. She grimaces- as she hops of before she falls and thinks.

"Right.. so not enough. Good Grief.." She murmurs- before leaping back up to plant both- and this time being launched off of the wall rapidly.

"Ugh.... third times the.." She grumbles- as she takes a moment to calm herself and think about what she is doing...

Before she steadily advances towards the wall- and plants a foot on it- holding steady for a full minute before the second joins it- and she starts to steadily walk up.

"So it's like this."* - Tue Nov 17 00:10:40 2015

And thrusts a right hook for the center of body of her foe.

"HAIYA!"* - Tue Nov 17 00:13:13 2015

"Izanami gave it to me last night." She explains, as she unfurls it and starts to read- speaking as Sanoke asks. "Katon Chakra flow." She states idly. "She mentioned Suimen was useful as a basis, too.. for the concept, anyway." She admits calmly- as she lets her eyes scan the scroll up and down steadily- humming calmly as she analyzes the theory Iza already schooled her on.* - Tue Nov 17 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh, Katon. Laaame. - Tue Nov 17 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's basically just making your weapons real hot. - Tue Nov 17 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, it's one of my three elemental affinities.. - Tue Nov 17 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And I wanted to learn a Chakra Flow for practical purpose. - Tue Nov 17 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Three affinities? Not bad. What's your other ones? - Tue Nov 17 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Raiton and Water... - Tue Nov 17 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: But I'm not so hot with elemental Ninjutsu, mostly. Chakra Flow, however, is both suiting to hwat I do, and useful.. - Tue Nov 17 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Seems legit. I'd offer to help you, but you managed to have the only elements I can't use. - Tue Nov 17 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hah, legit? Damnnn. - Tue Nov 17 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Kinda funny, really. - Tue Nov 17 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Right? That coincidence. Anywho, best of luck. - Tue Nov 17 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly- as she compares what she just learned about Suimen to what the scroll says about controlling chakra flow. The concept of wrapping it around her weapon without infusing the weapon with flame and thus tampering with her soul technique makes the goign slow- but she figures it out relatively quickly, humming calmly.* - Tue Nov 17 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I meant like... - Tue Nov 17 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Tue Nov 17 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: That was interesting. - Tue Nov 17 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I'm ah, gonna go find something to do then. - Tue Nov 17 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) hums calmly as she continues to read the scroll- understanding better the idea of how to heat her chakra for the technique, among other things.

"And /then/ you wrap it... a'right." She murmurs calmly- thinking on the topic as she does. She's doing her best to wrap her head around the concept- humming calmly as she does, scrolling through the scroll and attentively scanning it all.

She nods idly as Aza speaks.

"Later, yo.."* - Tue Nov 17 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) finishes the scroll, eventually- scanning it quietly.

"Really, quite fascinating.." She muses as she tucks it away after a long while reading. "Harder n' it sounds... but easier than my first impression." She muses idly.* - Tue Nov 17 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yo, Kazekage-Sama-Senpai-Kun. You awake? - Tue Nov 17 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Marco.. how good are you at producing normal clothing? - Tue Nov 17 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Decent. Why do you ask? - Tue Nov 17 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I have an order to make. - Tue Nov 17 00:43:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Your supposed to be doing my  thing.. - Tue Nov 17 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I have a lot on my plate. - Tue Nov 17 00:52:28 2015
