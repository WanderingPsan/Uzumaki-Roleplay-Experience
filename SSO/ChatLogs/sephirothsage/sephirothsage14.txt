"If you really want to fight, then let's fight. Sure- lead the way." She says- a faint and obviously.. concerned? frown on her face as she starts to follow him, sighing as she tucks her hands into her pockets.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) draws her sword in a smooth, fluid motion, sighing as she relaxes back on her feet- staring at the man across from her cautiously as she assumes a calm posture- blade held left handed, right hand half-way curled.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) flows. It's the best word for what she does- wary of his state; unsure what she's dealing with.. as rather than her usual strategy- upon witnessing his body begin to shift and change, and that surge of murderous intent... a playful smile rests on her lips.

"I guess... I can't take this lightly..?" She muses softly, as her left hand blade sweeps into his wrist- intent on pushing his attack to the right as she steps to the left, and winds back her right hook; readying it as she stares into his eyes with a broad grin.

"A'right, you little monster... show me what you can do!" She laughs out, as she flows behind her blade to push him to the side while cutting into his arm at full strength- not holding back like her fight with Momura.

"LET'S DANCE!"* - Tue Nov 10 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Don't get all beat up..you are suppose to spar me. - Tue Nov 10 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Not quite yet. - Tue Nov 10 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shifts as he falls back, tensing into a crouch. As he transforms and launches at her- she laughs wildly.

"Yeah! That's the spirit! Is this what you really are..?! Then don't hold back- show me it all!" She roars- as his piston slams for her gut, and her right hook aims for his jawline- even as her blade rears back intending to thrust for his heart.

She isn't playing around; she's already realized that he's in too far gone of a berserker fit to hold back.. so she won't either- she'll just hope he's strong enough to stand toe to toe with her...

As his blow lands in her stomach; and the unstoppable force pushes the imovable object as she roars in rage and pain.... and laughs aloud- eyes ablaze with a joyous gleam.

Even as her fist homes for his face...

And her blade lunges for his heart- aiming to thrust between his ribs here and now, if he doesn't think quick; or have a tough enough hide.

Even so- as his blow connects, blood is dripping down her lips... a gleam in her eyes as they exchange blows. This- this kind of thing.. this is what she lives for.* - Tue Nov 10 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: (( PSSST. THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU BREAK MY SWORD.)) - Tue Nov 10 06:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Hmm.. Yan's going to do something? He has no idea... - Tue Nov 10 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces- dropping the hilt as he shatters the sword and likely shreds his own hand... as her hand veers to the side so that she takes his punch to the chest, this time- rather than the gut. She grimaces, as more pain lances through her body. That nameless sword of Iron is shattered and cast away- but her arms are past his guard... as she clasps them both together.

His hit hurts- but it's not beyond her ability to endure, as it strains her ribcage and bruises her flesh painfully.

Her hit, she's already decided, will do more than hurt- as she brings her hands together inches from his throat....

And forms her blade into her hands, roaring. She forces her soul into her hands; knowing she can't keep it out where he can reach for long, knowing she cannot risk a blow.. but at the same time..

This is her chance at finishing, as she forms the blade within a moment- and forces it forwards into his throat- desperation and what must be panic in her eyes.

"I'M SORRY!" She yells out- as she moves into the blow quickly and firmly.* - Tue Nov 10 06:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces. It's a moment. A long, painful moment. She's bleeding from her lips as she stares back at her foe. Her hands are pushed aside- and the blade continues to form, it's long length as it forms allowing her to keep it on target despite the chain pushing her hands slightly off-target.

Even so- it's enough to change things. Moments after the chain pushes her arms to the side, water is roaring towards him. Her blade nicks his neck; barely cutting into it and pressing his adams apple into it...

Then sand forces it back, and she staggers away- panting... and heaves an audible sigh of relief. Her blade fades from sight, and she staggers back; letting her actual levels of injury show as her foe is bound and caught.

He's cut- but it's not near as bad as it was meant to be; a cut that is dangerous if left untreated, but shouldn't be lethal with medics nearby- as she staggers away- hiding behind the shield of sand as she staggers back, holding her gut...

"....T-thanks.. Christ, he suddenly.. started to kill me.. for no godamn reason!" She coughs out- grimacing. ".. Shit, and it was pretty fun until then.."* - Tue Nov 10 06:47:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts, looking up and shifting- wincing at the movement- but then nodding.

"Yeah, sure. Let me explain, man. Basically- a'right. Jiki made fun of Jekyl over there.." She begins- gesturing at Aza. "For losin a fight to this kid, Ivel, who did some wierd fire stuff a while back. It really pissed crazy dude off- and initially he challenged Jiki to a fight. Jiki said no. He, still pissed, accepted an offer I had made several hours ago for a fight against me- said he wanted to blow off some steam from getting so angry. I  agreed, cus I like sparring- and I figured it'd be good training. We head into the Arena- and as soon as I say I'm ready, he starts to fuckin transform into some.. wierd.. fuckin monster thing. He yells he's gonna kill me- and initially, I just defended myself." She explains, going on and nodding calmly.

"I initially treated it like a normal spar despite what he said. Then, he shattered my sword. I panicked- and used a Jutsu of my Clan to form a back up weapon, aiming for his face in a fit of panic as he went for the kill as well... thankfully, we where stopped by Jiki and Yan- so no one got too seriously injured." She explains calmly, wincing.

"Long story short? He went crazy and tried to kill me in a spar. Then I panicked and tried to end the battle- figured a medic on site meant if I disabled him, he could be fixed."* - Tue Nov 10 07:19:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods her head apreciatively.

"Many thanks, my man." She says- as she smoothly takes the blunt in hand, lifts it to her lips, and takes a long drag. She breathes it in and inhales- handing it back before exhaling slowly; lips pursued to form a smoke ring as she sighs softly.

"Really takes the edge off."* - Tue Nov 10 07:31:24 2015

"No, but I have been resting a bit more than usual. Uh.. sorry. I'm not the best at taking care of my body- probably due to high pain tolerance, I just sorta... don't seem to notice that I'm injured until it physically inconvienyences me." She admits sheepishly- wincing at the bandages, but then she nods.

"Anyway... Gotcha. I'll head to the hospital in a few to get some over night rest and care there.. I'm tired anyway, so I may as well. Anything I should keep in mind.. And uh... how long until it's safe for me to fight again?"* - Tue Nov 10 07:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Yo. - Tue Nov 10 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) scratches her head as she walks out into Sunagakure- and finds a construction crew busy laying the foundation for a new home- in the style of the village as per average, one of the adobe homes having the foundation and bricks laid- along with a general floorplan laid out.

She turns as Jiki adresses her, and waves.

"Yo, Jiki. Sup?" She says calmly- as she is already walking in to start helping lift things and move them for the crew- moving bricks into position and hauling lumber. It's easy work compared to fighting, thankfully- and she moves just so to avoid straining her ribs overtly.* - Tue Nov 10 20:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she works- hearing him speak. She nods, gesturing.

"If you wanna help, you're free- I won't stop yah, Jiki. What is it you wanna talk about?" She inquires as she turns to work consistently at hauling things around for the actual contractors to install and raise properly- humming as she helps mostly with the hard labor- knowing she doesn't know enough about carpentry to assist with the rest of it- but admiringly taking notes of the way they raise the stucture.* - Tue Nov 10 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as he mentions her injuries, then shrugs.

"I suppose. A few broken ribs- nothing too bad. It'll heal within a week- and light work like this won't strain it too much." She explains calmly- as she moves around a wheelbarrow and moving loads where they are needed.

"Anyway.... Apology accepted, and.... Did I? Fuck, I can't remember what I wanted to speak to you about.."* - Tue Nov 10 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) calmly nods, listening in and hauling the supplies around- as the workers begin to raise the walls one by one; working at a remarkable pace with the two Shinobi assisting them as they raise the interior walls first- then the exterior. The building is remarkably sturdy- but then, the Sunagakure style lends itself to very strong single story buildings.

"Ah, yeah. I was offering that we all go get some drinks and chill out to take a load off after what happened." She explains placidly as she tips another wheelbarrow, before heading to heft a hammer- looking around as she scratches her head.

"Mrm.."* - Tue Nov 10 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Hmm.. - Tue Nov 10 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Soo... How would you like to.. do that? Well.. After this.. - Tue Nov 10 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs, chuckling as she starts to shift Roof-Shingles for the house upwards into a pulley for the workers- nodding as things are nearly finished; humming serenely as her hard work seems to be nearly coming to an end.

"That'd be nice, yeah man." She agrees placidly.* - Tue Nov 10 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shirabafaru(Dragonfile) thinks: I must stall them. - Tue Nov 10 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shirabafaru(Dragonfile) thinks: afk - Tue Nov 10 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as something just has to happen to ruin her enjoyment of the moment- as she drops the wheelbarrow- bows in apology to the contractors... and then turns to run towards the source of the scream, hand going to her swords hilt- only to remember that it's gone.

"This is going to suck.. okay, just.. don't get hit in the chest." She decides calmly.* - Tue Nov 10 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: .. Oh. - Tue Nov 10 21:28:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Probably it.. - Tue Nov 10 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as she walks up to the door that seems to be marked with blood, and tilts her head to the side.

"Godamn, really?" She muses- as she pushes the door open, shaking her head in vauge amusement as she enters.* - Tue Nov 10 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Christ... - Tue Nov 10 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) looks around the house, hands tucked into her pockets and a vauge frown on her face.

"Lady! Where are yah?:* - Tue Nov 10 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Eh? - Tue Nov 10 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) approaches the scene, rubbing her head and frowning- still unarmed due to not having replaced the sword the guy broke a while ago. She stretches out as she looks around, scratching her head.

"What's goin on..?"* - Tue Nov 10 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) meanwhile, is jogging towards the scene- visibly unarmed, and uncaring as she approaches- a frown on her lips as she looks over the scene- arriving just in time to see a chain whip out to try and entangle marissa- unsure what the source of that is.. or even who that woman is...

She frowns as she approaches...

And looks to Kiyoko as the woman screams out.

"Yo, Doc Lady. What's ogin on- wait.. didn't mean it..? Ach, that guy from yesterday attacked you, didn't he... christ- well, like I said... s'long as he doesn't kill anyone.." She sighs, tilting her head back.

"Guys! We're gonna wanna restrain him."* - Tue Nov 10 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) meanwhile, continues to approach- but pauses as she see's the amount of force already arrayed against Aza... ndos slowly- then looks towards the Doc, frowning as she approaches that woman, instead of the fight.

"Yo, Doc. You okay? If you can talk me through what needs to be done to help you, that'd be cool.."* - Tue Nov 10 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ach shit.. - Tue Nov 10 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yan, lift her off the sand. We'll need to clean out her wounds after this. - Tue Nov 10 22:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs, as she reaches for the Syringe that Kiyoko pointed out- pursing her lips in dissapointment at Yan's handling of the situation. She takes the Syringe and stares at it for a long moment- then injects it as directed into Kiyoko's thigh.

"Right, and then she said to.." She murmurs, working onwards..... Right, yeah. I need to get you to a hospital.. and a shower.. and shit.."* - Tue Nov 10 23:21:10 2015

"Yo, little homie. What are you doing in here?"* - Wed Nov 11 00:37:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) looks up as a strange man barges into the house, Byakugan active- searching for weed. She takes a long hit of her Blunt, then stares at him for a long, long moment- frowning.

"The fuck are you doing in here? HAve you never fuckin heard of /knocking/ asshole?" She inquires with a frown- as her hand goes to her hip- only for her to remembe rshe has no sword.. and sigh.

"Like, the hell?"* - Wed Nov 11 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) squints at Jay, tilting her head to the side as she sets the blunt down- intending to let Yan finish it when he gets back.. then slowly but surely stands up.

"You.. couldn't help yourself from breaking into someone elses house, dude..? What are you, a fuckin Klepto?"* - Wed Nov 11 01:05:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... Yan. - Wed Nov 11 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: This wierd guy broke into the house, and he says he's here for Drugs. - Wed Nov 11 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: He's also so high he already forgot that he broke in. - Wed Nov 11 01:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Go do missions, make money then get somewhere to stay. - Wed Nov 11 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Simple as that. - Wed Nov 11 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) looks at the man- and calmly stands up. She is an effeminate, elegant, graceful woman. Yan may notice- there is a mostly smoked blunt on the table- she saved the last few tokes for him while he was out- as she rises to stare at Jay.

"Dude. Get out, or I will RKO your ass."* - Wed Nov 11 01:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: How would using a sword be a clan technique? - Wed Nov 11 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... The sword is something I summon. - Wed Nov 11 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: That is- it is made of Chakra and my spiritual energy. - Wed Nov 11 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Chakra is spiritual energy... - Wed Nov 11 01:26:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yan, trust me on this one. - Wed Nov 11 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) calmly nods- holding her hands together and focusing for a moment- as energy gathers into her hands; forming and twisting. Chakra and something else merge into her hands- then expand outwards. The blade forms first; purple energy shimmering into what seems to be steel of some kind.

"By your order, Kazekage." She says simply- leaving out her usual joking stream of honoriffics, as she holds the Nodachi that forms in her hands proffessionally... and begins to approach the man- looking towards Yuudai and bowing her head in apology.

"Any last words, yo? I feel kinda bad about this- but the law is the law, and the Kazekage has ordered your death- so you're gonna die. That simple, man. I owe this village too much to go back on orders."* - Wed Nov 11 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Hrm? - Wed Nov 11 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I beleive the same, but laws are laws.. - Wed Nov 11 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Wed Nov 11 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: ..Is that Sanoke behind that mask? - Wed Nov 11 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods peacefully, sighing as she bows her head.

"I hear your last words. My apologies- but the Law is the law. For Sunagakure." She says calmly- no hesitation is visible in her next action. She breathes in- then out.. and brings the Nodachi down in a two handed blur. Her aim is precise and simple, as she moves to decapitate the unresisting man smoothly and firmly with her full strength behind the blow to his throat- even if she doesn't fully decapitate him on the first stroke, she'll likely collapse his throat and cut in enough to instantly kill him, due to the sheer force behind the blow as she steps into it.

"...Sleep forever." She murmurs softly to herself, as she makes the smooth stroke with her entire body behind it, rotating to push it in deeper and finish this as smooth and quickly as possible.* - Wed Nov 11 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Sir, he did mention his friend was Tetsumi. You may want to work on how to handle that. - Wed Nov 11 01:43:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces as she is forced back- the blade flying out of her hands and then fading out of existence once it does. She grimaces; as she conjures it back to her hands upon being forced back- staring at the being that just fled from her upon transforming.

"A Jinchuuriki..? Damnit!" She curses under her breath- as the tailed form of the man moves to punch through the building and out- grimacing.

"....There's no way I'm going to be able to keep up with that.. or fight a Bijuu in my state.." She curses, as she realizes that after the adrenaline dies down, and sighs... still holding the backup Nodachi she conjured now, but clearly upset.* - Wed Nov 11 01:59:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) takes a deep breath and nods- letting her sword flicker away into nothingness... as the blade briefly shimmers before fading.

"...Very well, Kazekage-Sama. Will that be all for now, then..?" She inquires calmly- seemingly not even remotely emotionally affected by having just taken a life.* - Wed Nov 11 02:27:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) catches the keys and walks off.* - Wed Nov 11 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) upon heading back home- lounges back against the table- and forms something in her hands.

It's her sword- sharper than ever. She stares at it's edge, as she feels the boys soul screaming within her own... assimilating slowly but surely; devoured by her hateful energy. It writhes- and then it too, joins her blade; and the edge twinkles in the lighting of the room..

And she smiles gently.

"....One day..." She murmurs softly- leaving the rest unsaid, as she dismisses the blade after a while.* - Wed Nov 11 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs as she continues to hold the icepack to her side, thoughtfully staring up at the ceiling. She blinks a few times- then sighs and closes her eyes.

"Ah, well..." She muses softly, as she stares at the ceiling for a while. She stands up, grunting as she does- and heads to the back room, intent on checking on something..* - Wed Nov 11 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) knocks on the bathroom door, as she approaches.

"Yo, you guys still busy in there?"* - Wed Nov 11 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yo, Seriously, I gotta wash some blood off me. I just did an execution for the Kage, and I am in a bad mood. You guys still busy, or can I come in and catch a shower? - Wed Nov 11 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out and nods.

"Ah, a'right. Tell me when you're done, yeah." She says calmly- not having opened the door, just knocked and spoken. "I'm fine- unless you can fix broken ribs any quicker than they are already being healed, nothin left to be done but rest. Anyway- tell me when you're good to come out. It's not my house, it's Yan's, so I can't make any spare clothes offers- but I'm not a bad tailor. Seeyah soon!"* - Wed Nov 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly- sighing faintly as she gestures. She hasn't smoked any- but she's rolled up a set of joints, mostly. She looks and waves as Yan walks in.

"Yo. The doc and Ortho are still in the shower, but almost done. Welcome back... christ.." She sighs- letting out a low sigh, rubbing her forehead as if stressed as well.

But then again- despite how she reacted at the time.. she /did/ just kill someone.* - Wed Nov 11 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Alright. I'll check on them. - Wed Nov 11 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: This should be funny.. - Wed Nov 11 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sidles up to lean in the doorway with an amused expression- still a bit bloody from chopping someones head off.* - Wed Nov 11 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: They better not be doing anything in my brathroom... - Wed Nov 11 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, Sure. - Wed Nov 11 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) gestures to where they are sitting in a line. On the table. Unsure if he is currently blind or not- she sure as hell didn't hide them.

"So... shit, that happened man.."* - Wed Nov 11 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly- sighing wearily.

"Yeah, the law is the law... shit, that was my first time, too.." She murmurs, closing her eyes and sighing as she accepts the joint- taking a long, smooth hit before handing it back in turn.

"...As for what I wanted to talk about... well... first- I'll say this, before I say anything. Lyan already knows, and he and I have an agreement where he won't tell anyone if I behave. I want you to agree to the same thing- what I'm about to tell you, you don't tell anyone unless I go rogue, a'right?"* - Wed Nov 11 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I already know. - Wed Nov 11 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... Oh. - Wed Nov 11 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Shit. - Wed Nov 11 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well the- wait. - Wed Nov 11 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: If you already knew, why the fuck are you being this nice to me? - Wed Nov 11 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Wha? - Wed Nov 11 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) squints in obvious confusion, scratching her head as she stares at him- frowning; unsure if he means what she means.

"...We're talking about the same thing, yeah?"* - Wed Nov 11 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You are a deathbringer..a necromancer. - Wed Nov 11 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Right? - Wed Nov 11 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... A'right, so we are talking about the same thing. - Wed Nov 11 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'd like you to talk to me about it. - Wed Nov 11 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ..... - Wed Nov 11 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So I guess Lyam told you, huh? - Wed Nov 11 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I suppose you're like.. what, a priest in training or somethin...? - Wed Nov 11 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Agh... anyway, uh.... shit. - Wed Nov 11 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: No. I am just a jounin of this village. - Wed Nov 11 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Okay. What kinda questions you got to ask, then? - Wed Nov 11 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Do you care about this village? - Wed Nov 11 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stares at him for a moment- then nods, sighing.

"Yeah. It's a damn sight better than Huevo Diablo, that's for fuckin sure. I'm glad I chose this place to run away to when I was younger, and I'm glad for what I've picked up here. I owe this place a lot- it's a debt, y'know? Besides... back home, they wouldn't approve much of a woman like me wanting to live the way I want to live. Back there, a Womans job is to pump out kids- not wage war." She says- evident disdain and ... anger, definitly rage, entering her tone at the end- before she takes a breath, and calms herself.

"..Anyway. Yeah. Long story short? Yeah. I care about Suna."* - Wed Nov 11 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: As long as you act in the best interest of this village, and I see that--that's al lI care about. - Wed Nov 11 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: .... Fair enough, I guess. - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Any other questions about... my proffession? - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We had a necromancer before that couldn't handle that. - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I orderd him killed. - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So you can't control people at all, can you? - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see. Take it he... what? Put personal power first? Or ju- Hrm? Nah, not at all. - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I didn't learn that shit - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I learned what I used to execute that guy. - Wed Nov 11 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He was assaulting women with his mind-control necromancy. - Wed Nov 11 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I kill people, and devour their souls to empower mine, which I then use as a weapon. - Wed Nov 11 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I don't do shit to you that anyone else can't, until you're already dead. - Wed Nov 11 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ....Well. - Wed Nov 11 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, taking a long hit as he stares back at Yan.. sighing wearily.

"But.. yeah. 's all I do. Nothing any more imoral than normal murder- and I plan to restrain myself to people it's legal to kill, and people who are attackin the village.. or self defense, but hey. Self defense." She explains, sighing and letting it all out before handing the joint back.

"...Thanks for gettin the priest of my ass, though. First thing he did upon detecting what I was, was threaten to kill me."* - Wed Nov 11 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks for a long moment- then holds out a hand. Her blade is soon forming in her hand, as she stares at it.

It's slightly different than before- but only in one percievable way. It's visibly sharper, and seems to almost glow internally- a slow, pulsing beat.

"Logically? I know why I chose to do it. I know that I grew from it- that my soul is more now because of it... but at the same time... I dunno. I felt like I had no real reason to do it beyond that, apart from the law.. and I feel like he didn't deserve it. That I felt his screams the entire time I was assimilating him didn't help.. but at the same time.." And then- she let's out a low chuckle.

"Nothing I have ever done in my life has felt so damn fucking /good/."* - Wed Nov 11 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Oh.. - Wed Nov 11 03:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I didn't see where Tetsumi took that guy... - Wed Nov 11 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He has experience in Aza's situation, so I imagine he's the best person to help him. - Wed Nov 11 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah? Here is hoping, yeah. - Wed Nov 11 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ..So... - Wed Nov 11 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: No judgement on the soul-eating, yeah? - Wed Nov 11 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Cool. - Wed Nov 11 03:47:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles peacefully and stretches out as the food arrives, grinning faintly.

"Well... my ribs are fine. Hurt a little, but I've been restin like I was told, mostly. Haven't fought at all." She says warmly, chuckling. "I have properly followed my Doctor's orders, yeah." She agrees- humming as she goes straight for the curry.

"Hey, how do you do that clone thing?" She asks as she sets out a plate of curry with a few pieces of Sushi on the side.* - Wed Nov 11 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, as she begins to eat, and talks between bites, humming cheerfully as she chews on the curry and enjoys it- humming.

"I see... hey, you're a Jounin right? Got any Chakra paper laying around? I'm curious." She explains calmly, as she eats hungrily. "I never bothered findin out, cus.. well... got my own shit.. but yeah. Curious."* - Wed Nov 11 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) picks up the paper... focuses chakra into it...

And stares as it first sparks briefly- before exploding into a mist of steam as it burns and turns moist at the same time.

"... /Huh/."* - Wed Nov 11 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Lightning...fire..and water?  - Wed Nov 11 04:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: My Chakra control is great- but ... - Wed Nov 11 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: As a Necromancer, my chakra is a bit different from a normal persons. - Wed Nov 11 04:07:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) is eating curry and Sushi at a table with Yan, humming as she chews on the curry chicken.

"Yo, names Mitsunara. Nice to meetcha dude- thanks for lending a hand with that chick, I had no idea what I was doing."* - Wed Nov 11 04:08:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) frowns, leaning back in her seat and sighing- looking towards yan.

"Yo, Yan. You believe him? Because it sounds like he didn't kill anyone who didn't need to die, so we don't need to fight here. So let's all just chill, yeah?"* - Wed Nov 11 04:24:57 2015
