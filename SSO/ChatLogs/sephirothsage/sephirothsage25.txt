"So... a hoodlum, huh..? Internim-Kazekage-Sama-Senpai-Sensei-Kun-Chan, can we have a physical description so Koji can find his ass?'* - Wed Dec  2 04:42:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs and follows Koji- chuckling calmly.

"So... a Fuuton user with bad breath, huh..? I wonder if he can actually hurt me.." She murmurs idly as she moves to follow Koji- hand on her swords hilt as she smiles lazily- yawning calmly as she moves to follow the man.

"Anyway. Lead the way with your... special eyes, yeah." She says- scratching her head with her right hand.* - Wed Dec  2 04:52:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks calmly beside Koji- as they look around and she fiddles with her sword- humming as they walk. Eventually, they approach a derilect neighborhood of Sunagakure. 

The alleyways are as broad and huge as ever int his desert- but they've got an advantage. The mans house- they have tracked him into a building. She looks around.

"So, he's around here Koji?" She inquires idly...

Even as someone watches them from a nearby window- stank ass breath wafting from his lips..* - Wed Dec  2 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) cracks her shoulders as she looks around- looking towards Koji and yawning.

"Mrm..? Ah... that sound... yeah, probably him." She muses idly- as she starts to advance forwards with a lazy smile, and a composed calm- as she heads around the side of the building.

"You come 'round the other side. Let's do what we can do.." She muses idly- as the tiny midget with monstrous breath swells up his cheeks- then expels a barrage of wind bullets just as Mitsunara is turning the corner.

She grunts- shifting to the side as a few graze her- rather than piercing straight through her like would be considered normal, though- they seem to impact her in a way much closer to hard punches than bullets as she grunts.

"Tch.."* - Wed Dec  2 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts at the blast of foul smelling wind- but holds her ground as she plants her feet against the blast- feeling the cutting of the wind as it blows sand toawrds her- even as she forms her blade between her hands.

"Ugh.." She grunts- as the foul smell wafts over her moments before she reaches him... and she presses forwards to launch her stroke.

She steps forwards and swings in a broad horizontal crescent- as she breaks through his attack to slice towards his body- grunting as she closes her eyes and relies on her sensory abilities- to keep them from being damaged or watering, even as she makes her initial stroke.* - Wed Dec  2 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts as the clone explodes around her blade, and sighs as she looks around- frowning.

"...Tch..." She grunts- as she moves to follow Koji, only to be stalled as she forces herself to scrunch her nose up and hold her breath as the stank-cloud passes over her..

"Shit.. I'm no good at pursuing like this.>"* - Wed Dec  2 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) meanwhile, forms her own clone so it can split off from the duo- as she moves to head one way, and her clone moves to head off the nearby alleyways and escape routes- as she grimaces and stares at the person they are chasing.

"Ugh, what a drag! Why the hell is a competent Shinobi doing stupid prankster shit like this, really..? What an idiot!"* - Wed Dec  2 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) meanwhile, has her own clone draw it's sword and brandish it threateningly- as she herself runs in from the side as the Syrup trap immobilizes the man- and she forms her real blade into her own two hands.

A dark, seething purple Nodachi forms into her hands- and as she lunges it forwards...

Rather than striking his body, she simply slides in to hold it to his neck as he is immobilized- the blade seething darkly, as the twisted chakra and spiritual energy it is formed of seethes in an almost unholy fashion- hungry and gleaming.

"Surrender... or I put an end to your career. Permanantly." She demands as she moves in- even as her clone moves to take the hit for Koji's own- dispersing to make a show of protecting her 'team-mate'.* - Wed Dec  2 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) laughs in the mans face- and speaks in a flat, emotionless tone in response to his pleading.

"Silly. I don't care what you have to say. If you give me a reason, I'll do whatever I have to to ensure this mission is completed. Now- come along." She says lazily- kicking him towards the agents as they arrive before letting her weapon fade away into nothing but a shadowy mist.

She cracks her shoulder- yawning as she looks at Koji.

"Yeah, let's turn this in.... ugh, what a boring mission that was.."* - Wed Dec  2 07:02:24 2015

"If you do, it's out of a desire to make sure I die, not to see me live- let's be honest." She says with a lazy tone- before looking around and yawning.

"Anyway... I gotta go train.. or something. Good luck with your missions, Priest."* - Wed Dec  2 07:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles lightly at his tone and shrugs.

"As if you truly care." She says lazily- eyes fixed on him as she looks into his own- watching the anger play upon his face with a broad grin.

"Hah.... Such hate, such rage! You hate me so much more than I hate you, isn't that right..? By the Darkness... by all the demons in the depths of hell- isn't it funny?" She teases idly, hands out to her sides as she shrugs. 

"Ahh... you, the holy, righteous man- hate me so much, are so angry at a few mere words- so unable to keep your calm, to control your emotions, to be the bigger man- it almost seems to /hurt/ you to act like a sane, rational man in this case.... meanwhile- I could care less that you're a priest. I could care less if you attacked me right this instant- I'd just move to defend myself, same as anyone else...." She traisl of- shrugging.

"You hate me alone, more than I hate anyone in the world. And I'm the evil one, here- the heretic? The sinner..? What a laugh.."* - Wed Dec  2 08:00:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stares at Bryson, with a lazy smile- then chuckles.

"Anarchist..? What in the manifold layers of the hells makes you think me an anarchist, makes you think me against order? Why, I'm an exceptionally orderly individual! I'm just amused by your hatered and morality. I am absolutely loyal to this village- to the order and laws of my home. I'm not any kind of anarchist, dear." She says with a lazy smile.

"Now, I have no idea why you hate my kind- apart from the whole 'raising the dead, devouring souls, and playing with dark forces beyond mortality' business- or what 'great wrong' you seem to think that necromancers as a whole did.... but still.." She shrugs- smiling lazily at him.

"To call your hate for me rational and justified when I've never done a damn thing to you or anyone of yours- why, I think that is /quite/ malicous, don't you? Rational? Justified? By what rationale, by what justification? There are plenty things to hate me for, priest- but you've yet to name a reason beyond my nature and what i am!" She says with a fierce grin, a gleam in her eyes.

"I test you because I want to see what will happen. Because I don't trust you anymore than you trust me. And because I still remember how the first thing you said to me when we met, was a death-threat."* - Wed Dec  2 08:26:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and turns to walk away- sighing quietly.

"What a strange man... Heh. Let's spar sometime, why don't we?" She suggests lazily- as she looks around and turns to wave at Chikyu.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, if you're the one asking.... Sure. - Wed Dec  2 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Great!  - Wed Dec  2 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hah! With how excited you are over this all, I wonder if you just want to see lots of people in maid outfits and swimsuits. - Wed Dec  2 09:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah...she already asked me.... - Wed Dec  2 09:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: *sigh* I couldn't say no. - Wed Dec  2 09:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I guess your future wife really wants to see you in a swimsuit, huh Lera? - Wed Dec  2 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Or do you think it's the maid outfit that she's more interested in, neh? - Wed Dec  2 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: What a hilarious world we live in.. - Wed Dec  2 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I guess so... - Wed Dec  2 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Not like she hasn't seen me without anything... - Wed Dec  2 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly, sighing as she leans back.* - Wed Dec  2 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Sometimes skimpy is sexier than nothing at all, mhrm. - Wed Dec  2 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) snickers faintly at Chikyu's response- crooking an eyebrow upwards at the girls suspicous denials, as she listens calmly to Chikyu with a lazy smile- nodding along and rolling her eyes.

"Hah! Of course, of course! Just because it's literally entirely your idea that you've actively promoted and talked every girl you've met into, and gone out of your way to fund and push for, doesn't mean you have any ulterior motive for it! Nope, not at all!" She teases sarcastically, a smile on her face as the picture flies free and she sneaks a peak- snickering faintly as she gives it an apreciative glance even as Chikyu stuffs it away.

"Hah.... even if that was the case, it's not like that's even anything to be ashamed of, y'know." She teases idly- relaxing her sarcastic tone to a calmher one as she shrugs.

"It's not like I mind- and if anyone else /actually/ minded, they wouldn't say yes, y'know."* - Wed Dec  2 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Even if I do think you're a bit young to think about those kinda things, it's nothing really wrong, mhrm. - Wed Dec  2 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Shinobi never cease to ammuze me... paying lera to dance... a maid cafe, what ever that is , and a swim suit contest, should be ammusing - Wed Dec  2 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: ...Well.. - Wed Dec  2 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: ....At least things are still cheerful, even after... - Wed Dec  2 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: ....God, why am I still sad about his death..? - Wed Dec  2 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: What kind of a killer am I, feeling sad about stupid things like that.. - Wed Dec  2 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Think about what kind- of things... Haha..hahaha.. You're so silly MItsunara. - Wed Dec  2 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly- before Chikyu shifts to give her a hug. She laughs softly as she hugs her back firmly, and whispers right back into Chikyu's ear- a faint smile on her lips as she squeezes her freind.* - Wed Dec  2 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: She knows my secret. She must die -omit- - Wed Dec  2 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Oh, you know..~ Lewd things!~ - Wed Dec  2 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Heh... you're acting all cute n' stuff. You know, if you still find me attractive in two years or so, look me up, neh? Hah!~ - Wed Dec  2 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Hrm? What's wrong, Kohai? - Wed Dec  2 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: *Blushing* Wait...what are you saying. Hehehe its not funny to tease me around just because you know I'm a lesbian.  - Wed Dec  2 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Y'know, funnily enough, I didn't know that? But I'm not teasing or kidding. If you like me, I'm fine with that- personally, I don't favor either gender, really... beauty is beauty- but I've got a minimum age on people I'd date. - Wed Dec  2 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: So- yeah. I'm serious.  - Wed Dec  2 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: I should really start on that training... - Wed Dec  2 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) just chuckles- and continues to smile placidly without letting Chikyu go- giving her a warm squeeze before letting her go and cracking her shoulders, tilting her head to the side and just... smiling at her.* - Wed Dec  2 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Really...Oh! Oh... *she bites her lip* Well I mean... I just always saw you as a good friend. I didn't even think about you like that...but maybe if you really want to.. in two years... *she trails off* - Wed Dec  2 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: But training is so boring... - Wed Dec  2 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I mean. I've thought of you as a freind to, so.... It's whatever you know? If you wanan give that kinda thing a try- cool. We'll see where it goes and if feelings of /that/ kind happen. If you don't wanna give it a go? Don't. - Wed Dec  2 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: That's life, mhrm. - Wed Dec  2 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Have any of you seen Makoto? - Wed Dec  2 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: That sounds...like tit be really nice. Guess, I'll just have to wait and see in a few years. - Wed Dec  2 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Mrm. Yeah... and before you ask- no, it's not that you're not pretty. It's that I'd feel like a pedo or something, goin on a date with someone less than sixteen yearso ld. - Wed Dec  2 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and shrugs, smiling as placidly as ever as she stretches and looks around.

"Sorry priest- I haven't."* - Wed Dec  2 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I see... - Wed Dec  2 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Where is that girl - Wed Dec  2 09:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: No... No I understand, don't worry about that. I really do. I'm.. just surprised theres another girl thats like me. And even if its in a few years, that she might want to date me. - Wed Dec  2 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: You are suprised by this after we earlier this day talked about how Lera and Kiyoko- also two girsl- are getting married? - Wed Dec  2 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Hah! Man.. you really can be clueless, sometimes... Mrm. - Wed Dec  2 09:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Oh no! I knew there were others like me, like you said Lera and Kiyoko. I just didn't think any of my friends would like people of the same gender, and then beyond that actually like me in return. I'm normally just...used to it being one sided. - Wed Dec  2 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Hah, I see... Mrm. Well- I mean. I think the way you tend to act is kinda cute, you're fun to fight, generally fun to spend time with.. I get along with you- and I like both genders, so... I mean, I figure if you turn out to have a crush on me, it'd be pretty smooth. I guess that's an odd sounding way to put it- but.. - Wed Dec  2 09:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: The way I see it, someone I know I can be freinds with, would be someone pretty safe to date? - Wed Dec  2 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Well... I mean I never look at my friends that way. Maybe this event thing has gone to my head a bit, but I really don't want to view my friends as merely crushes. Though- I think you're really beautiful, if you don't mind that coming from a younger person.  - Wed Dec  2 10:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I guess I see what you mean. Honestly, I'da never guessed you where into chicks if not for this whole thing... - Wed Dec  2 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: You also fun, nice to talk with, you have a really solid way with thoughts and words. I guess fun to fight you as well, though you seem to enjoy it a bit too much. *She softly elbows Mitsunara in the side* - Wed Dec  2 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Heh, it's whatever, I s'pose... Mrm. I guess I think of dating a bit over logically- but then.. - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I think of most things that aren't fighting a bit too logically.. and I think of fighting with almost no logic at all, bwahaha! - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Ahh.. Heh. - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Gah... You and Rias both said that, I thought it be obvious... Maybe I should wear a badge or something. - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles at the elbow, then shrugs.

"I mean.."* - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: I don't think with much logic in either. Hehehe! - Wed Dec  2 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I don't see how it's really that obvious until such time as you actually show attraction to a chick. How am I s'posed to guess someone's sexuality unti they do something to show it off? - Wed Dec  2 10:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Oh... I guess so... Hmm, ah that makes this all much harder. I have to be friends with people, as while subtly showing I'm attracted to them without making it seem thats the only reason I'm friends with them... Phhffaa! This is all really hard to think about. - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: And stuff like this? - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Is why I don't even try to be subtle about that kinda stuff. - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Too much hassle. - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Hmm... Sounds good... I guess I'll be more obvious about this stuff. I guess I'll test it on you first! I think you look really pretty in that kimono you always wear. - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I mean, more often than not, I won't be picking up on subtle signals from someone else... and I'm no good at i- - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Heh. Thanks- I agree, I look fabulous in this Kimono!~ - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Meanwhile, your outfit goes nicely with your hair, even if it is a bit suprisingly skimpy! - Wed Dec  2 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I really like how the red contrasts the white, though, mhrm. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Yeah... Well, my dad raised me like a boy for most of time. So I just tended to train without a shirt, and well.... when I started growing these. My dad forced me to wear something, and well... I just don't normally feel comfortable in something like that. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Ah? Explains a lot... - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Heh, is that so... Sadly the only thing else I have to wear is this maid outfit. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: As if you really mind that much, heh. - Wed Dec  2 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Anyway... It's gettin pretty late.  Anyone know if anyone moved into Yan's house after he died..? If not, I'll probably move in- I was living with the guy anyway, and... I'm kinda homeless otherwise, so.. - Wed Dec  2 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well... Give me a second. - Wed Dec  2 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: .. Huh? - Wed Dec  2 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Koji stays in that house - Wed Dec  2 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, but he was stayin in it back then, too. - Wed Dec  2 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Now its just Koji - Wed Dec  2 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Guess I'll need a new place to stay.. - Wed Dec  2 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Hmm Hassans house is old but usable, Aza's house is free, and um you can...... stay with me if you want. - Wed Dec  2 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Rather not die in my sleep, no thanks. - Wed Dec  2 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Thank god - Wed Dec  2 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Thats fine, doesnt bother me - Wed Dec  2 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: / - Wed Dec  2 10:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ....Wonder where Chikyu went.. - Wed Dec  2 10:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Changing I assume - Wed Dec  2 10:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Or looking for a home for you - Wed Dec  2 10:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) whispers: And, its just because were friends. Not anything else. *she says with a smile* - Wed Dec  2 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) turns and smiles faintly at Chikyu, scratching the back of her head.

"Yeah... that'd be apreciated. I just heard from the Priest while you where out that Koji is stayin at Yan's place, so.." She smiles and chuckles at Chikyu, nodding. "I'd definitly apreciate it, mhrm. Thanks- I'll crash on the couch, or whatever; I don't take up much space, cus to me a home is just a place to sleep at night, so.." She smiles gently.

"If you're really cool with it- I won't be much of a hassle, yeah."* - Wed Dec  2 10:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: More lesbians.... why was I assigned to this village... - Wed Dec  2 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Because you a priest, the only thing your laying down in the middle of the night with is the bible -omit- - Wed Dec  2 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: because I am secretly the Antichrist. - Wed Dec  2 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: mwahahahahah! - Wed Dec  2 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: My bible is in a protective case at night... it cost more than your life - Wed Dec  2 10:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and nods- smiling gently.

"Yeah, thanks... so- mind showing me what Couch I'm crashin on? It's late, n' I'm tired."* - Wed Dec  2 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sure, let me lead the way. - Wed Dec  2 10:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles and nods- bowing her heads lightly apreciatively.

"Yeah... hey- thanks." She says gently- stepping forwards to give Chikyu a brief hug- before turning to look at the dusty cushions near the table... slapping them a few times to dislodge the dust- coughing... and then curling up, still fully dressed, with two of the cushions- and within seconds, snoring.* - Wed Dec  2 10:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out and yawns as she walks into the square, then waves at Kiyoko.

"Yo."* - Wed Dec  2 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Where have you been! - Wed Dec  2 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hm? - Wed Dec  2 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles as Kiyoko seems to leap from the bench- then squeeks at the projectile hug- chuckling softly as she gently squeezes Kiyoko back and then, with a soft smile, she replies smoothly.

"I was out of town on a mission that Hassan had given me just a little before everything went to shit- finding a Samurai Village and delivering supplies to them."* - Wed Dec  2 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she steps back and nods.

"Yeah.. I got pretty worried for a while, when I heard there was a war goingo n here, I won't lie... hurried back- but.." She sighs and shrugs as she closes her eyes and tilts her head back.

"....Gonna be sad to not have Yan around... and Hassan... Yan was my best freind, after all.." She admits- a sad sigh escaping her before she stretches out and shrugs- before smiling at Kiyoko.

"Anyway. Glad to see you and Lera made it through- I'm lookin forward to attending your wedding, after all!"* - Wed Dec  2 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs as the other woman speaks.

"Ah... Heh... I guess I'll get over it eventually... anyway!" She says- suddenly brightening up noticeably.

"So, Chikyu keeps telling me about some kinda Maid Cafe and Swimsuits thing? You joining in, or..?"* - Wed Dec  2 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at that- arms behind her back as she smiles gently.

"Ahah, I see. Will your nurse uniform at least be in the spirit of things?"* - Wed Dec  2 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh... shame. Well, Chikyu has me joining in, at least.. - Wed Dec  2 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Should be fun! - Wed Dec  2 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Hm...maybe I should buy her a more...revealing nurse outfit... - Wed Dec  2 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Just for the bedroom...hehehe. - Wed Dec  2 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Do ittt. - Wed Dec  2 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Will be a nice change from the Gimp outfit. - Wed Dec  2 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: -omit- - Wed Dec  2 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You are going to wear a maid's uniform? - Wed Dec  2 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she nods.

"Yeah, and I'll change into a swimsuit later, too." She adds on with a lazy smile- idly noting the blush in Kiyoko's cheeks with a half smirk.

"Eheh.... Mrm. You know, Lera isss right behind you. Maybe you shouldn't be reacting like that to someoen else with your fiance so close..?~"* - Wed Dec  2 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .... - Wed Dec  2 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Erg. - Wed Dec  2 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: W-whaaa, I wasn't! - Wed Dec  2 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) snickers idly at that reaction, chuckling.

"Hahhh! And things like this? Are why I don't even bother to be subtle about these kinda things, mhrm. Hah.."* - Wed Dec  2 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I w-wasn't... uh... - Wed Dec  2 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I mean it's normal! - Wed Dec  2 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You guys are always teasing me! - Wed Dec  2 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) snickers faintly as she nods- crossing her arms under her prodigous bussom and chuckling.

"Yeah, yeah. I know, I know- I'm too sexy, it's impossible to not be attracted." She declares with an arrogant tilt of her head and a broad smirk- before breaking down laughing a moment later- relaxing into a more good natured smile as she sighs at Lera swooping in on Kiyoko from behind.

"Mrm.... and I'm not worried. I'm happy for you two, you know? It's good to see two people in a healthy, warm, loving relationship who are there for each other." She says- honest and firm as she speaks softly- doing her best to hide her simple envy for both of them- for anyone with that kind of relationship, for anyone who can feel strongly enough to love like that...

"And I can earnestly say I wouldn't try to get in between you two, even if I thought I could- and I'm pretty sure nothing I could do would even hurt your guys relationship anyway, so.." She shrugs- chuckling.* - Wed Dec  2 20:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at the wink- crooking an eyebrow as she nods back and smiles playfully.

"Well, I'd certainly enjoy something like that, if you two would.. it sounds fun.~" She says in a teasing, playful tone- leaving it equally uncertain if she herself is serious or not... mostly, at least...

Apart from the gleam in her eyes as she looks at the two of them. "Don't you agree, Kiyoko?~"* - Wed Dec  2 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at that- and smiling gently, arms still crossed under her bodice.

"I don't really have a preference between the two genders, honestly. I see a hot dude? Attractive. I see a sexy lady? Attractive! I guess I'm a pretty simple chick when it comes to those kinda things, mhrm. I mean- I had a crush on Yan. I also think the both of you are hot. Y'know?" She says with a warm smile as she looks at the two- feeling vaugely touched by the general warmth and closeness displayed by the two's posture....* - Wed Dec  2 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: How interesting. - Wed Dec  2 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Kill me now. - Wed Dec  2 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and nods, relaxing her posture as she lets her hands drop to her sides.

"Mrm... Yeah. See you around, Lera!" She says warmly- before looking towards Kiyoko and chuckling- before smiling almost kindly.

"Ah... sorry- you seem embarassed and uncomfortable. I'm sorry about all this- still, I can't say I'm not looking forward to that kinda day, y'know...~ Heh, see you around! I've got things to do."* - Wed Dec  2 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Nng... y-yeah.. of course. - Wed Dec  2 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And besides- I'm sure you've things to do as well! Mrm. - Wed Dec  2 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'll be just outside the village if you need to find me hun. - Wed Dec  2 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and smiles gently at Kiyoko.

"See you around, yeah Kiyoko-chan?~" She says cheerily, before waving and turning to walk off, humming calmly.* - Wed Dec  2 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hrmmm... - Wed Dec  2 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mitsunara...you said you wanted to talk about jutsu before right..? - Wed Dec  2 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Yeah, I did. Sup? - Wed Dec  2 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I got time now. - Wed Dec  2 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see... Mrm. - Wed Dec  2 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well... a'right. Can you learn Lightning Jutsu, and can you use Kenjutsu with Samehada? - Wed Dec  2 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yes and yes - Wed Dec  2 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A'right then. Let's head somewhere we won't be listened in on- we can talk about what you can teach me back on the way. A'right? - Wed Dec  2 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sure thing - Wed Dec  2 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Oh wait she has lightning too!? - Wed Dec  2 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: -- wait wha- - Wed Dec  2 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) is yoinked the fuck away! Still- as they fly... she composes herself.

"So. I've got a Raiton B-rank... Lightnign Style Shadow Clones.... and a Kenjutsu C Rank; my Crescent Moon Beheading stroke." She explains as they land- swaying a bit.

"Meanwhile... I have Fire, water, and raiton affinitise, but no exceptional training in them, so.."* - Wed Dec  2 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hoh.....A raiton B rank and Raiton Shadow clones...very interesting. - Wed Dec  2 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: What other elements do you possess? - Wed Dec  2 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: -- Eh? The Raiton Shadow clones are the B Rank.... and like I said- I have affinities for Fire, Water,a nd Lightning... - Wed Dec  2 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Fire and water. - Wed Dec  2 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: But no Jutsu outside of my clan Jutsu, Fire Chakra Flow, the Shadow clone, and that Kenjutsu move, so.. - Wed Dec  2 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Well. I use both Water and Fire...well I use every element but thats besides the point. - Wed Dec  2 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm, I see. - Wed Dec  2 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I uh.. don't suppose you already know any Kenjutsu styles? Or anything else that would be well... - Wed Dec  2 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I also know some genjutsu - Wed Dec  2 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Taijutsu as well - Wed Dec  2 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: A few Shuriken jutsu... - Wed Dec  2 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Anything you'd be willing to show me in exchange for those two Jutsu, that would be useful for a dedicated swordswoman. - Wed Dec  2 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Which- I'll let you decide the worth of those two techniques. If you want, I can demonstrate. - Wed Dec  2 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: No thats okay. - Wed Dec  2 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A'right. - Wed Dec  2 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. So you'll be wanting jutsu that are fast to use - Wed Dec  2 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mhrm. - Wed Dec  2 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Good for close range. - Wed Dec  2 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright...Exploding Flame shot is a good one. No handseals and you can use it up close or at long range. - Wed Dec  2 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Same for Lightning Ball... - Wed Dec  2 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Raiton Flash. - Wed Dec  2 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Maybe Shadow Clones as well. - Wed Dec  2 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Wed Dec  2 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: What's Raiton Flash? - Wed Dec  2 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: A basic body defense mechanism. - Wed Dec  2 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You release a surge of Raiton from your body into the air around you - Wed Dec  2 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah... - Wed Dec  2 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see. Sounds useful enough.. - Wed Dec  2 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm. Generally it'll momentarily stun an enemy - Wed Dec  2 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Let you get an attack in - Wed Dec  2 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Any Handseals required, or nah? - Wed Dec  2 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: None - Wed Dec  2 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: If not- that sounds about right. - Wed Dec  2 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Unfortunately...I don't have many jutsu of those elements that don't need handseals - Wed Dec  2 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: If you had Doton... - Wed Dec  2 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But you don't. - Wed Dec  2 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Though I can give you scrolls for the other jutsu as well, if you feel like learning more. - Wed Dec  2 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well... how about Flash and normal shadow clones. For Beheading and Lightning Shadow Clones. - Wed Dec  2 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mitsunara. - Wed Dec  2 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I don't hold anything back from my friends. - Wed Dec  2 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: If you want to learn jutsu, just ask. I don't expect to be paid. - Wed Dec  2 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And- to be frank? I'm not that interested in pure Ninjutsu, if I'm honest. I was hoping you knew some Kenjutsu, because of that giant sword of yours.. - Wed Dec  2 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Ah yeah...I felt the need to learn how to use this. - Wed Dec  2 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: It was an inheritence from a....friend.. - Wed Dec  2 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Or something useful for close range. Still- that flash thing, and another kind of shadow clones... both sound useful as backups for my style. - Wed Dec  2 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'm looking for things useful in a sword fight, more thana nything else, y'know? It's how I fight, after all. - Wed Dec  2 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. - Wed Dec  2 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Do you want the scroll? Or to be taught. - Wed Dec  2 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'd probably prefer being taught. I'm not the best reader, y'know? - Wed Dec  2 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sure. - Wed Dec  2 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Same question to you, for my twot hings. - Wed Dec  2 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Want me to teach yah, or a scroll? - Wed Dec  2 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'll take the scrolls if thats okay. - Wed Dec  2 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah.... - Wed Dec  2 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Actually... - Wed Dec  2 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I only know Crescent well enough to write a scroll for it.. - Wed Dec  2 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Ah...Oh well, you can give me it later. - Wed Dec  2 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) rubs the back of her head, smiling gently.

"Sorry, yo. I'm just not that good at the Clones, mhrm." She admits with a slightly embarassed smile- before reaching into her robes- and pulling out a scroll.

"This should show you how to go about the Beheading technique, though. You should find it easy- it's pretty much Nin-Ken, because of the way it uses chakra."* - Wed Dec  2 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. - Wed Dec  2 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Do you want to learn now or later? - Wed Dec  2 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah.... Now would be nice. - Wed Dec  2 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sure. - Wed Dec  2 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We'll start with the easiest then. - Wed Dec  2 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Where do we start? - Wed Dec  2 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Raiton Flash. - Wed Dec  2 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly- paying close attention to what her freind is doing- and nodding. She vaugely remembrs how to shape her chakra into raiton form from her training with the scroll for the Raiton Bunshin...

As she nods slowly, stepping back.. and breathing in.

"Alright.." She says softly- as she gathers her raiton chakra into her stomach, her center...

Then pushes it outwards- and then she staggers, groaning as she gives herself a painful shock.

"Auyahh..."* - Wed Dec  2 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ....You need protect your body. Keep it as Raiton chakra as it moves outwards, only fully release the Raiton when it leaves your skin. - Wed Dec  2 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Right.. okay. - Wed Dec  2 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly as she steps back and breathes in for a moment- before nodding.

"Okay... right.. this won't be too hard.." She murmurs.. thinking quietly as she picks apart the chakra- focusing all of her weak sensory abilities on disecting the Jutsu to aid her understanding...

Thankfully- its' a relatively simple technique, as she clasps her hands together and focuses- gathering the chakra...

And then forcing it out while shielding her body- emiting a weak pulse of electric force from her body.

"Ah! There we go!" She says cheerily. "I think I've got the basics.."* - Wed Dec  2 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Good. - Wed Dec  2 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Do you mind if I teach you the shadow clones another time? - Wed Dec  2 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Sure, that's fine. - Wed Dec  2 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. I'll See you later then Mitsu. - Wed Dec  2 22:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. I'll...bring it up. - Wed Dec  2 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: If she's not game, I understand. Still- see you later!~ - Wed Dec  2 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) appears behind Sanoke.

"Hiiiiii."* - Wed Dec  2 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at his response.

"Not much, but I found doin that really funny. Mrm... got anything needs doing- also... do you know if there's anyone in this village who can teach me proper Kenjutsu..? I still dont' have a teacher for swordplay.."* - Wed Dec  2 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah... what a bummer... - Wed Dec  2 22:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks of to a corner as she decides to start working on her chakra control the best way she knows how- by repetively practicing assorted Jutsu. She starts with something that lacks handseals entirely- flexing as she expels Raiton chakra from her form into a visible explosion of energy around herself that crackles into the air around her, and leaves her hair standing upright.

"Heh.."* - Thu Dec  3 08:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Awh... she looks like she can use that jutsu better then I can... - Thu Dec  3 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Should probably go work on my jutsus too... - Thu Dec  3 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) cracks her shoulders after a few moments of resting- then nods as she brings up her hands.

"And then there's this.." She murmurs softly- as she forms a few handseals- then splits into another form. She grins at her clone, who grins back, and nods as they step back and she stretches- looking at her identical clone.

"Ugh.. still tiring as fuck.."* - Thu Dec  3 08:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly- not really noticing the boy as he jumps around- as her clone draws it's sword, and she does the same- thinking for a moment before nodding...

"Right.. now..." She murmurs- as she and the clone suddenly both perform different Jutsu. She moves forwards- swinging her sword in a sudden crescent blur as the clone shifts to the side and unleashes the Raiton Flash; which doesn't even slow her down as she steps forwards to pursue through the energy burst, and her clone reacts just in time to barely avoid her strike- as she holds back to fight evenly with her weaker clone for the sake of training.

"Heh.."* - Thu Dec  3 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: And she knows Kenjutsu!!! - Thu Dec  3 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles gently as her clone shifts against her, then forces her back slightly. She steps to the side; continuing to restrain herself to her shadow clones level, so to speak- operating at less than half strength just like her clone is to keep the fight fun.

Steel rings against fake steel again and again; Katana clashing as they flow. Both she and the clone pulse with the same Raiton Flash jutsu in the exchange- and while the clone is stopped briefly by the interference of chakra, she keeps on going- before dispersing it into a burst of sparks.

"They never do last long.." She complains softly.* - Thu Dec  3 08:29:52 2015
