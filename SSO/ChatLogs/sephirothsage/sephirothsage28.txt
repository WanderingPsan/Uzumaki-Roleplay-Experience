"Guess we're done here." She drawls out- chuckling.

"Want me to help carry him? And- Koji. I can help torture him, if you'd like!~" She says cheerily- a relaxed smile on her face.* - Sat Dec  5 07:57:26 2015

"Interrogation, if that's what you wanna call it. Anyway- like I said. I can come if you want, Koji. I'd like to help!" She says cheerily- as she enjoys the pleasant, chilly feeling of a ghost fondling.* - Sat Dec  5 08:00:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) leans against the wall- waving as Koji exits.

"Yo. 'M here mostly cus... well- two reasons. One. I'm not that bad at torture, if you feel the need. And two. If the sentence end's up being death, I'll be pleading to the Kage for permission to handle it- for... well- shit. Everyone knows I'm a necromancer by now. If there's to be an execution- I get tangible physical benefit from doin it. Feel me? I can wait outside for now if you like- you can call me in to scare the balls off of the fuck if you want. As it is- whatever you say goes, I s'pose, until it's time to ask the Kage for a sentence."* - Sat Dec  5 08:17:04 2015

"Yeah. I think there's a Genjutsu that some people can use that makes Interrogation easy... but I don't have it, so I'll be old fashioned." She admits calmly- a lazy smile on her face as she enjyos the chill clinging to her with a calm smile.

"And I can promise- I won't kill him, if you leave him to me. But I might make him think I will... and he might lose bits and pieces." She admits calmly. "And... healing someone to torture them is sometimes nesascary, if they take a while break. It ends up becoming a cycle! Torture, healing, torture, healing... Mrm.."* - Sat Dec  5 08:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow at that- chuckling.

"Oh really..? What- is she only shy and nervous up until you get her in the bedroom...? Does she take charge once she gets ready, or stop being so shy and change tone entirely?" She teases idly- an eyebrow raised as she stands with her hands in her pockets.

"And.. hey. If I ever make you uncomfortable with the banter, uh.. tell me, yeah? I'm not the best with people, so I'm not sure when I'm messing up, you know? And.. you and Kiyoko are.. pretty much the closest freinds I think I've ever had, at this point... so I don't wanna lose you guys cus I went too far, or said somethign stupid, y'know?"* - Sat Dec  5 09:46:40 2015

"...I'm glad I met you and Kiyoko, yeah... shit, if I didn't have you guys, I'd probably still be angsting over Yan's fuckin death, like some kind of emo teen.. Hah, fuck.." She trails of- chuckling gently and smiling faintly.

"..So.. thanks. For being a freind, yeah? I'm also freinds with Chikyu, and Momura.. but... I guess that's different? I dunno.." She trails of and sighs- smiling.

I suppose there are a few things I'd consider wants worth pursuing when I had a chance; like some armor from Marco, or a sword better than this Iron hunk of junk I have to use when I feel like holding back... but to be honest? - Sat Dec  5 14:22:17 2015

"Ah.... I suppose so- though, I am the expert on souls, y'know." She teases idly- before looking at Chikyu with a lazy smile.
