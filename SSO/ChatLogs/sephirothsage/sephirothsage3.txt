"Hey let's.... let's not, yeah?" She says warily, her attention on Berny ripped away entirely as she stops doing anything to hold the Genjutsu on him, frowning as she looks at Gojiro.

"Yo, you're head is being messed with, this ain't natural, or real. And besides, you are.. definitly not my type, you feel me?" She says- trying to be polite and kind as she can about this.. bizzare situation.* - Wed Oct 14 02:01:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Idle question. - Wed Oct 14 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hana, do you practice Kenjutsu? - Wed Oct 14 03:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But? - Wed Oct 14 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I don't really have anyone teaching me, so I've just been trying to practice on my own to try and learn the basics with a Tanto. - Wed Oct 14 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I don't even have a proper Bokken or Katana... - Wed Oct 14 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I would be really grateful if you could just lend me a hand..? - Wed Oct 14 03:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: If you thought it would be amusing? Yes. - Wed Oct 14 03:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Suggest to Waggle-chan..that she changes her hair back. - Wed Oct 14 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I see. So you want me to.. assist with prayer services, and funerary work? - Wed Oct 14 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Alright, fair enough. When and where? - Wed Oct 14 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Wed Oct 14 03:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'll need you to look it over, and study it. - Wed Oct 14 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm.. A'right. I'm no medic, but I'll see what I can do. - Wed Oct 14 03:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You're so kind, Ketsuki-chan.~ - Wed Oct 14 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) jogs off.* - Wed Oct 14 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks out onto the field, waving as she approaches with a warm smile. She's changed into something a little less plain than her drab grey Kimono- into a form fitting black leather outfit, a heavy coat tied up well. Her Tanto is worn at her hip, and her hair has been tidied up and pulled back, mostly just brushed strait. She waves with a grin as she walks up- then bows.

"Hai, Hana-San. Heya!"* - Wed Oct 14 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles and nods, putting her hand on the hilt of her Tanto. She bows respectfully- then beams happily as she explains.

"Ah, it's fine. I've never had a teacher before! And uhm... if I'm honest, all I know about using a sword, I know from watching other people do it, and reading books- I don't.. actually know anything properly about it." She explains, blushing lightly as if vaugely embarassed by these facts.

"But ah... I'm wiling and eager to learn whatever you can teach me!" She says, grinning wide and eager as she draws her Tanto into a clumsy one handed grip- holding it before her in her best mimicry of Hana's own posture.* - Wed Oct 14 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods quickly, a grin still fixed on her face as she grips the Tanto a little bit tighter.

"I just wish I had a proper Katana to do this all with, rather than a tiny little Tanto, y'know?" She mourns idly- as she drinks in the other woman's posture and grip with those onyx eyes. Her leather clad form shifts as she plants her foot, and with her free hand, brushes the flowing black hair out of her eyes.

"Anyway... Right. Hold it tightly, at the hilt. Got it!"* - Wed Oct 14 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slowly, watching the younger- but more experienced- Shinobi closely.. and smiling broadly. She nods firmly as she soaks in her words, then plants her feet and starts to slowly but surely, move the sword through the displayed form.

"Right.. you have to keep the edge facing away from yourself, tightly held- yeah?" She says- trying to understand keenly as she steps into the slow swing, then steps back before repeating the motion; moving with as much precision as she can muster.* - Wed Oct 14 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods at that, grinning as she pulls the Tanto back at the offer.

"Hai! Coming right atcha, Senpai!" She says brightly, before stepping forwards. She plants her right foot down, then slides her left forwards with her body to put more force into her strike- a stabbing thrust straight for the gut as she lunges straight forwards.

She's grinning wide as she throws the sloppy blow..* - Wed Oct 14 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grits her teeth at the blurring movement. She can't really follow it- not by a longshot. She plants her left foot firmly against the ground where her rush came to a halt, as the hilt taps her... and pivots on the spot, shifting from a stab to a slash as she turns on the spot to face her sensei.

"What does any of that even mean?" She protests, frowning at the words she was given, narrowing her brow in confusion. The sand shifts around her feet as she swings the blade recklessly; guiding the tiny Tanto with both hands towards the other womans chest.* - Wed Oct 14 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) frowns as the woman goes around her, blushing at the embarassment of being so overwhelmed, not to mention the sight of the highly developed womans high speed movements. However, she sighs as she accepts the criticism- nodding her head.

"Right...." She says softly- frowning. She doesn't get what the woman means by acting like the sword; nor what she means by not trying to hurt ones opponent. However- the rest of the explanation at least, makes good since; as she does her best to accept the guidance in her grip.

"So.. Timing.. and my speed with the sword. That's what I need to work on?" She inquires- furrowing her brow. She nods a few times, as she soaks it all in with a studious and learned mind. "Right, yeah.. I'll be fine, definitly. You go get whatever rest you need- I think I'll keep practicing for a while longer." She says- smiling gently, as she takes a step back- bows....

And then begins to try and move her sword in the side to side pattern that Hana was suggesting, stepping side to side while sweeping the blade as fluidly as she can- though it's not so easy to mimic proper Katana movements with a Tanto...

"...I really need to get myself a proper a sword, too.."* - Wed Oct 14 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Annnd I am gone. - Wed Oct 14 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah- alright. - Wed Oct 14 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Have a good one! - Wed Oct 14 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) whispers: Becareful. - Wed Oct 14 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I always am! - Wed Oct 14 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) takes a deep breath, as Hana speeds away, then lets it go with a faint smile. She shifts her posture- and starts to repetitively practice the smooth movements that Hana showed her- doing her best to replicate and learn from the sword technique she just had displayed to her; though she's completely unable to really match that kind of speed, sheer stubborn practice may be able to eventually match her skill..* - Wed Oct 14 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) goes on for a few minutes, before pausing to take a deep breath. She holds the tiny Tanto two handed, a frown on her face...

"I really need to get a proper weapon, some time... anyway, I should propably... Yeah, definitly." She trails of on that sentence, before turning to leave the training field.

"I definitly need to turn in that mission.."* - Wed Oct 14 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I would imagine every Bijuu to have like - Wed Oct 14 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) freezes as the blade pierces the ground before her- hand shifting to the hilt of her Tanto, as her eyes flicker to the source of it all, her body pivoting on the spot.

"What the hell?!" She squeeks out in suprise, as she almost leaps backwards away from the blade that very nearly impaled her foot.* - Wed Oct 14 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) frowns as he does; settling back onto her heels in a tense fashion, frowning darkly.

"What do you want." She asks of him, as she crouches slightly to reach for the Kunai in the ground with one hand.* - Wed Oct 14 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) frowns, as she bends to heft the Kunai out of the ground.

"Yeah, but.... this is a Kunai. What I need is a Katana. I don't mean to be ungrateful, but.. a Kunai certainly isn't what I was talking about. That said- regardless of any of that, if you'd like to spar I'd be happy to. Any restrictions on what can be used?"* - Wed Oct 14 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods calmly... as she bows her head respectfully.

"Alright then. Let's spar, then." She says with a faint smile, as she steps back.. and forms a series of handseals in a deft motion of her hands- her mind lunging out as she forms a basic Genjutsu; black leaves seeming to fall from the heavens around Hiro, acting as the seal for a certain Jutsu of fear, as her chakra flows out of her, into the Jutsu.

"Let's see if this works.."* - Wed Oct 14 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks- caught completely offguard by both the mans manifestation of the Sharingan Doujutsu.. and by the mans simple shattering of her Jutsu after activating it. Her eyes narrow as she slowly draws her Tanto into her two handed grip, and squares her stance.

She gulps as the other Shinobi lunges towards her, and sweeps out with her blade to meet his rush, stepping forwards to sweep the back of the Tanto towards him; intent on landing a hit, but not wanting to cut him with the blade, and so striking with the blunt back of the blade.

"Never had that happen before... and those eyes... what..?"* - Wed Oct 14 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares on- eyes widening at the mans fluid defeat of her attack. She grimaces, as his left pushes her back; her body just too slow to avoid, even if she see's it coming and her mind thicks of ways to avoid it. It's aggravating in the extreme as she's forced backwards, holding her Tanto firmly as she frowns.

"...Damn... you're pretty good... Tch, damnit.." She grimaces, as she crouches briefly.. and throws the Tanto high, towards his face, while her other hand draws the Kunai for a low thrust.. and her leg tenses for it's own blow, waiting until she's in close. She's not bad for a Genin, at least- but she's certainly no prodigy by any stretch of the imagination, and her close quarters skills seem.. lacking.* - Wed Oct 14 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces- as her Kunai is parried... and she braces against his kick... and as she strains to hold against the parry to her Kunai, even as her Tanto flies past his face... and as she braces against the floor... to slam her left knee up towards his groin as he's locked in near her by the clash of blade on blade, and kick on chest; her weaker strength straining to hold things for a moment...

As she slams up with her knee, grunting as she tries to land just one blow without disengaging from that clash- eyes burning with a quiet determination.* - Wed Oct 14 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) gasps out as the lock breaks, staggering away- then letting her eyes wander to try and find her Tanto as she forms up into a basic Taijutsu stance with the Kunai.

"Well.. a dirty shot was the only kind I was going to land. You're a lot better n' me.. and I can't say I'm ashamed to admit it. You're good. Really good." She says- a warm smile on her lips as she grins faintly.

"Want to keep going, or..? I mean, by the time I landed that, you may as well have won two times over."* - Wed Oct 14 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles faintly- and bows her head respectfully.

"And I concede that you are better than me- by far." She states firmly, bowing her head- before continuing. "That said... I don't believe that there is anything that is prohibited in seeking victory... though I'd never do anything lethal in a spar." She concedes, rising from the bow and smiling.

"So if I'm fightin someone who has balls, I'll aim for 'em."* - Wed Oct 14 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles as she walks towards her Tanto to bend and pick it up.

"It's how I approach all combat. I spar like this, because people fight how they spar."* - Wed Oct 14 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Oh- My name. - Wed Oct 14 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ketsuki. - Wed Oct 14 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles- taking the mans hand firmly and shaking.

"And a pleasure to meet you, too."* - Wed Oct 14 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: You're a very energetic girl, aren't you . . . . - Wed Oct 14 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) thinks: She's so weird. - Wed Oct 14 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh. I guess you could say that.. I like to give my all to everything I do, so as to do it right. - Wed Oct 14 06:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: That energy will lead you far. - Wed Oct 14 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'd like to think so. - Wed Oct 14 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I'd be willing to help you advance... - Wed Oct 14 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: If you don't mind my help. - Wed Oct 14 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? I'm always open to help with training, of course. - Wed Oct 14 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles as she cracks her shoulders and heaves a sigh.

"But for now. How about a meal, on me? I'm rather hungry after spending most of my day training, or sparring. Y"know?" She says brightly, tucking her hands into her pockets.* - Wed Oct 14 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Sure, I wouldn't mind. . . . . - Wed Oct 14 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles and nods, as she turns to walk away, humming calmly.* - Wed Oct 14 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles as they walk into the shop- and nods.

"It's what was closest, and I was in the mood." She says lightly- before looking to the man at the counter with a grin. "Beef Ramen for me. You, Hiro?"* - Wed Oct 14 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles calmly as she relaxes back.

"So.. are you a Chuunin or something..? You broke my Genjutsu without breaking a sweat- and the way you moved.." She trails of, shaking her head. "Don't think I've ever seen anything like that."* - Wed Oct 14 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) soaks that in for a moment- then nods, as their ramen arrives. She scoops it up briefly, taking a few long slurps.

"I see. I understand if you don't want to talk about how you came to be a rogue- but I'd be happy to, if you think it would help." she simply offers- a gentle smile on her face.* - Wed Oct 14 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods calmly.

"I can promise that. I am loyal to the village- but if you mean it no harm, I see no reason not to trust you." She says firmly, a smile on her face as she leans in to devour more Ramen.* - Wed Oct 14 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I see.... Well, like I said. - Wed Oct 14 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'm willing to listen, if you think it'd help. - Wed Oct 14 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Of course. - Wed Oct 14 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I just left the village because .... - Wed Oct 14 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: The village was going astray. - Wed Oct 14 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: It was headed to a path of war and destruction. - Wed Oct 14 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Considering the Kage before Zeus literally took the treasury and ran? I can see what you mean  by 'astray'... - Wed Oct 14 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Mhmm.... - Wed Oct 14 06:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Who's Zeus? - Wed Oct 14 06:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Current Kage. Not sure about his actual name, cus I'm pretty sure Zeus is his codename from when he was a Jounin or something like that. - Wed Oct 14 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Seems like a pretty good guy. Rather than push for war, he's simply gone straight to the Daiymo for missions, and is prioritizing getting the village running again, along with legitimacy with the Gezo. - Wed Oct 14 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I see. - Wed Oct 14 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I don't really understand a lot of it, but it all seems pretty reasonable for now...   - Wed Oct 14 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Okay. - Wed Oct 14 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Though to be frank, we're in a pretty bad position. - Wed Oct 14 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: That's good. - Wed Oct 14 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: The Kage Mansion's just a big crater, as is most of the front wall apparently.. - Wed Oct 14 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Things are looking good on the leadership front, and poor on the resources available one, y'know? - Wed Oct 14 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Anyway, sorry to interupt. - Wed Oct 14 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You where sayin? - Wed Oct 14 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: No problem. - Wed Oct 14 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Um... - Wed Oct 14 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I think that it's good, that the leadership is fixed. - Wed Oct 14 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I'm sure with the leadership intact, your village will thrive. - Wed Oct 14 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So long as no one attacks us while we're weak military, yeah. - Wed Oct 14 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Though, I'm sure Konoha has angered enough people over the years for that to be a real threat.. - Wed Oct 14 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Not to mention, Kiri and Kumo can't be happy about us stealing contracts from them directly through the Daiymo. - Wed Oct 14 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I think you'll do fine. - Wed Oct 14 07:02:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Like tutoring. - Wed Oct 14 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Here's hoping.. Hrm? And I'd be happy to accept. You're certainly a helluva lot better than me in a fight, standard issue male weak spot notwithstanding. - Wed Oct 14 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Oh, I disagree. You prety much had me dead to rights in that fight, had you been using a weapon rather than pushing me. - Wed Oct 14 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Of course- but you definitly would have won right at the first exchange, had it been a real ight, is what I'm sayin. - Wed Oct 14 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Anyway.. - Wed Oct 14 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So what is it you want to tutor me in, anyway? - Wed Oct 14 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Well. - Wed Oct 14 07:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I can tutor you in anything, I'm sure. - Wed Oct 14 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well.. what would you like to? - Wed Oct 14 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Fire perhaps... - Wed Oct 14 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Earth if you can use it... - Wed Oct 14 07:30:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Fire is my primary element, with Electric as my secondary... so that's definitly possible. - Wed Oct 14 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Like I said- I'm willing to learn what anyone has to teach me. - Wed Oct 14 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: Certainly. - Wed Oct 14 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinozuka, Hiro(Your Pocket Pikachu) says: I will teach you what I can. - Wed Oct 14 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles back, and lifts the cup of ramen she's holding in a toast, before tipping it back to drink the broth, before finally setting down the empty cup.

"And I will gratefully and respectfully accept, Sensei." She says calmly, bowing her head. "With that said, though.. It's quite late, so I think I'd best head to sleep for now. It's been a long day, y'know?"* - Wed Oct 14 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Lets just go Hana...I don't want to go through this again... - Thu Oct 15 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks into the square, stretching and yawning as she does.

"Yo, hey everyone. Hana-Senpai, Takeda-San, Phony Priest."* - Thu Oct 15 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hi. - Thu Oct 15 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Thu Oct 15 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Phony? - Thu Oct 15 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You keep calling me that, Harlot. - Thu Oct 15 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles as the two start to walk away as she approaches.

"Hrm? Oh, you two busy? A'right, have a good time!" She says cheerily- before looking to Nigen with a relaxed smile.

"And dude. You might be an actual priest, but I have no idea of what religion. I guess it vaugely amuses me... Hey, you mentioned work, right? Got anything at the moment?"* - Thu Oct 15 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Thu Oct 15 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Eh.. - Thu Oct 15 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Any right now? - Thu Oct 15 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeet Boy. - Thu Oct 15 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm about to travel to Kiri. - Thu Oct 15 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Babysitting..you would be troublesome. - Thu Oct 15 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yea- Oh, I see. - Thu Oct 15 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Headed out to Kiri, huh..? - Thu Oct 15 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Good luck with that. - Thu Oct 15 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Thu Oct 15 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Harlot..you're something else. - Thu Oct 15 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'm fuckin fabulous, I dunnow what you're talkin 'bout. - Thu Oct 15 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You honestly should just give into your temptations. - Thu Oct 15 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I call you a harlot, because I know what you really are. - Thu Oct 15 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) laughs at that, shaking her head and crossing her arms. She seems vaugely amused as she looks at the phony priest- then speaks calmly.

"Nah. Even if I was, you're not really my type." She says placidly, yawning. "Anyway, you have fun going into that den of mongrels and murderer's, yeah? I've got training to take care of, I s'pose."* - Thu Oct 15 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm not talking about myself..you idiot.. - Thu Oct 15 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Thu Oct 15 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: H-..heh. - Thu Oct 15 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: P-..pfft.. - Thu Oct 15 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: What's wrong? You seem nervous. - Thu Oct 15 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Come on now, Harlot. Do you really think that I'd be interested in a little girl such as yourself? - Thu Oct 15 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Nervous? I'm quite excited. - Thu Oct 15 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You'll eventually change your mind about my offer. - Thu Oct 15 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow at him, then laughs aloud.

"What offer?" She inquires calmly, as she leans against the fence.* - Thu Oct 15 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I should've spelled it out more. - Thu Oct 15 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Everyone has something they want, or desire. - Thu Oct 15 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What is it that you want? Strength, or is it money? - Thu Oct 15 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I still find it quite troubling that you thought..I wanted to do anything sexual with you. - Thu Oct 15 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I mean sure, I could offer you my love.. - Thu Oct 15 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That /is/ the general implication of the term harlot, you know. - Thu Oct 15 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Not many can handle it. - Thu Oct 15 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Indeed, but you're a harlot. You should accept it, but you wouldn't be my harlot in that way. - Thu Oct 15 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I don't need you to pleasure me, other people do. - Thu Oct 15 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles aloud at his attempts- a bemused look in her eyes as she relaxes against the wall.

"What I want, is relatively simple. I want, to see my village safe... and to be strong enough to ensure it stays that way. And that's not something others can offer me- that's something I can earn on my own... hell. It's better to grasp that for myself, than accept some strange bargain. What game are you playing at, anyway, priest..?" She crooks an eyebrow wryly, a veneer of vauge amusement hiding suspicous paranoia.* - Thu Oct 15 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles as she leans back- crooking an eyebrow.

"Being trained and taught by others is one thing. Getting into some kind of wierd, funky bargain..? That's something else entirely." She says firmly, arms crossed over her chest. The seventeen year old genin cracks her shoulders as she leans against the wall- thinking quietly.

"Besides. Whatever your offering, it's probably something... really creepy and wierd."* - Thu Oct 15 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Creepy? - Thu Oct 15 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Meh.. - Thu Oct 15 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Potato..tomato.. - Thu Oct 15 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: To put it another way, I don't quite trust you. - Thu Oct 15 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Why not, Harlot-chan? - Thu Oct 15 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm just a priest..~ - Thu Oct 15 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even Stretchy-kun can vouch for me. - Thu Oct 15 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If I was dangerous, he would've intervened long ago. - Thu Oct 15 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) crooks an eye at this.

"Everything about you screams 'creepy fucker, do not trust'. With that said, there's also this; there's no such thing as a one sided deal. What do you want out of what you're offering, anyway, Baka?"* - Thu Oct 15 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Thu Oct 15 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I just want you. - Thu Oct 15 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..... - Thu Oct 15 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ...To be the best that you can be.~ - Thu Oct 15 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: So much about this screams, 'shady as fuck'. - Thu Oct 15 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Like hoo my got, how shady as fuck can you get. - Thu Oct 15 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Don't worry, there's always time. - Thu Oct 15 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Uhhh huh. Look- I don't buy it. What do you want out of.. whatever the heck it is your offerin? - Thu Oct 15 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: With Lord Hokage here..you have nothing, but time. - Thu Oct 15 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Don't worry about it..I'm too shady.. - Thu Oct 15 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You wouldn't accept it anyway. - Thu Oct 15 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Would you, Harlot-chan? - Thu Oct 15 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow at the priest- as an incredibly anime annoyance kanji floats in the air near her.

"Stop calling me a harlot, godamnit." She says by way of response, rather than actually answering his question.* - Thu Oct 15 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Why, Harlot-chan? - Thu Oct 15 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You should love your name. - Thu Oct 15 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: My name, is "Ketsuki", not "Prostitute".  - Thu Oct 15 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) thinks: Those two seem to be getting along atleast. - Thu Oct 15 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Baka Baka Baka Baka! - Thu Oct 15 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I never said.."Prostitute".~ - Thu Oct 15 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That's such a harsh word. - Thu Oct 15 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That's what the word Harlot means, you phony priest! - Thu Oct 15 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Harlot-chan, I'd never call you something like that - Thu Oct 15 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .* - Thu Oct 15 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What.. - Thu Oct 15 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You baka phony priest, that is literally what Harlot means! - Thu Oct 15 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I-..I'd never.. - Thu Oct 15 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: HARLOT IS ANOTHER WORD FOR A PROSTITUTE, YOU ASSHOLE. - Thu Oct 15 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What ever do you mean? - Thu Oct 15 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Harlot is a loving term. - Thu Oct 15 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: -- How!? - Thu Oct 15 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: HOW!? - Thu Oct 15 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: How? - Thu Oct 15 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Think about it. I took the time to give you a nickname.. - Thu Oct 15 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: How, in your warped, depraved, twisted mind, is calling someone a kind of /whore/, a loving term!? - Thu Oct 15 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That's just how much I love you. - Thu Oct 15 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Harlot-chan, you shouldn't question love. - Thu Oct 15 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is love, afterall.. - Thu Oct 15 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: My love for you can't be trampled upon. - Thu Oct 15 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares at Sado for a long moment, eyebrow twitching in quiet disgust and rage.

"...Are you... are you- I can't even tell if you're seriously just that messed up, or if you're messing with me.. propably both, you baka phony priest."* - Thu Oct 15 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? - Thu Oct 15 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Are you confessing your love to me? - Thu Oct 15 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh, Harlot-chan! - Thu Oct 15 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: -- WHERE IN THAT DID YOU GET A CONFESSION OF LOVE FROM, YOU GODAMN LUNATIC?! - Thu Oct 15 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That gives me such a high. I don't even know how I'd be able to resist.. - Thu Oct 15 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: ..? - Thu Oct 15 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Now..now, Harlot-chan. You shouldn't be loud..someone might get the wrong idea. - Thu Oct 15 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) continues to twitch in ever increasing rage, clenching her fists.

"...What are you, stupid or something- or just godamn crazy? Or- more likely, considering you are the Kage's advisor.. just being an asshole to get a rise out of me? Is that it, are you just that kind of an asshole!?"* - Thu Oct 15 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Slowly increasing rage and hate? - Thu Oct 15 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Immense Frustration? - Thu Oct 15 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yes, for those who attempt to hurt you. - Thu Oct 15 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: My love for you is quite strong. - Thu Oct 15 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) just stares at him, head tilted to the side, brow furrowed, a frown on her face.

"Seriously, what the hell?"* - Thu Oct 15 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Don't resist it, my love. - Thu Oct 15 21:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Just accept it for what it is. - Thu Oct 15 21:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) twitches again, staring at him.

"..Sado. At this point I am sure that you are fucking with me. I think I'm going to get back to my training now, phony priest baka. I'll be around, a'right? I'm just.. I can't keep this conversation up much longer without doing something I know I'll regret."* - Thu Oct 15 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Thu Oct 15 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What will you do? - Thu Oct 15 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Do it.~ - Thu Oct 15 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Show me a portion of your love, Harlot-chan.~ - Thu Oct 15 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'll accept it in full strides. - Thu Oct 15 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) twitches again, then... loses her temper in a perhaps unfortunate way.

Her hands move- and shortly a curtain of black leaves is falling from the heavens around Nigen as she forms those handseals.

"Sure! Alright! Here's how much I love you, Baka Phony Priest!" She snarls; as she forms the Genjutsu with a suprising amount of deftness for a recently graduated genin; her intent simple. To inflict upon the Phony Priest his greatest fear.* - Thu Oct 15 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares long and hard at him, as the man plays about for a moment, before casually resisting her Genjutsu. She clenches her fists tighter, almost baring teeth, before harumphing loudly and turning to stomp away, arms crossed and eyebrows twitching angrily as she walks away.

"....Hrmph.."* - Thu Oct 15 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Come on, was that all the love you had?~ - Thu Oct 15 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Seems like you need my help.. - Thu Oct 15 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? - Thu Oct 15 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: A body? - Thu Oct 15 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Good! - Thu Oct 15 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) twitches at Sado's teasing, hands curling into tighter and tighter fists as she stalks off.

"I'll show you, I swear I'll.." She grumbles, barely audible as she heads for the training field.* - Thu Oct 15 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: I'll go get it real quick, heh. - Thu Oct 15 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Don't worry, Harlot-chan! If you need my help, just ask! - Thu Oct 15 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I love you! - Thu Oct 15 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Heh. - Thu Oct 15 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm..? - Thu Oct 15 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Do you know who it was? - Thu Oct 15 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: No. - Thu Oct 15 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Where'd you find it? - Thu Oct 15 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Alright...I gotcha. - Thu Oct 15 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) harumphs loudly upon walking out into the training field, drawing her Tanto in a motion marginally more fluid than what she was doing at the start of the week, and finding herself soon flowing into the forms that she was shown by Hana. Making sure to keep the edge faced away from her, and the blade in her grasp ever so slightly tilted, she tries to, as she was shown, simply let the motions of the sword flow from her.

Forwards step and diagonal slash, step back and horizontal sweep, step to the side and diagonal slash, step back and forwards jab. She flows through various movements as if fighting some invisible foe- imaginging another swordswoman acting in tandem with her, pausing her blade in the air as if it met another. She flows adroitly, doing her best to keep it all up and flowing, a quiet smile on her lips.* - Thu Oct 15 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) pivots on the spot as she continues her sparring with the air, blade cutting only wind as she practices her footwork and arm strength, sweeping and slashing with the Tanto in her hand as if it where a full length blade; each step she takes measured and practiced forwards and back, as she continues to hone her bladework. 

She pauses, as Gojiro approaches- holding her blade low in a two handed grip that the hilt isn't big enough to accomdate.* - Thu Oct 15 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Heh...Kenjutsu? Nice...Nice... - Thu Oct 15 22:10:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: How so..? - Thu Oct 15 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: I 'dunno. Sado-kun just told me to come help. - Thu Oct 15 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Didn't say how. - Thu Oct 15 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm. - Thu Oct 15 22:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Nah, I'm just holdin' this body. But...I've got some creations you could test your skill against... - Thu Oct 15 22:16:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ahh. - Thu Oct 15 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well.. - Thu Oct 15 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'm working on me Kenjutsu and Taijutsu, so that might help- a fight where I can't falll back onto Genjutsu. - Thu Oct 15 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Alright...Coo' Coo'...Just uh...Be careful, these things cost me a lot. - Thu Oct 15 22:18:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Just -one- though. - Thu Oct 15 22:19:44 2015
