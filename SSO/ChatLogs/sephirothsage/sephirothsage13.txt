<br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and nods as she begins to eat calmly.

"Yes- though I'll not test such in this place. In your shop, then." She offers calmly, before begining to eat her meal with a hearty joy, eating switly and effieciently.* - Mon Nov  9 12:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles serenely- as she stares at him with emotionless violet eyes, and reaches for a small cup of Sake- taking a slight sip before setting it down.

"....Mrm.. I love violence, and battle. I enjoy testing my soul against others in bloody combat- and the rush of it all. I had done so before I became a Shinobi. I became a Shinobi to do it legally."* - Mon Nov  9 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly as she finishes her cup, and sets it down. Her chickeen is gone, living only a small amount of noodles.

"Indeed. I imigrated here at a young age, however. My homeland is.. unfreindly to the idea of women doing much more than pop out children- and I wanted to fight at least partially to prove I was as good at it, if not better, than any man... so I left." She explains calmly.* - Mon Nov  9 12:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods, a faint smirk on her lips.

"..Yes. I intend to prove.. no, to become... the strongest warrior in the world." She says calmly- with a certain certainty of purpose about her as she pushes herself up.

"Lead the way."* - Mon Nov  9 12:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and nods. She cracks her shoulders briefly- before simply holding out her hands, as if she is holding a Nodachi. She grasps the air- and conjures the blade.

It seems to flow into existence; blackness forming it in her hand as it twists and coils into it's proper form within seconds, a dark purple energy emanating from the weapon as it forms into her hands- a gleam in her eyes as she holds it steady in her grip.

"I am the soul of my sword.." She murmurs softly; staring at the beautiful purple edge as it gleams faintly in the firelight- drinking in the light of the flames in the room.

"So.. go ahead, try to pick it up." She says calmly, sheathing it in a matching scabbard that appeared at her side then holding it out for him; smirking.* - Mon Nov  9 12:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. It wasn't voluntary, no. I had no strong feelings either way about letting you touch it- at least not consciously. - Mon Nov  9 12:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Is it really so hard to believe, Smithy? - Mon Nov  9 12:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Somewhat. . But I reckon in a world where Chakra Demons can materialize out of  thin air. . - Mon Nov  9 12:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Anything is possible. - Mon Nov  9 12:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly, stretching out and yawning.

"I can call it again and we can try it again, if you like- though I can only do it so many times before I am too tired to do it again." She teases lightly, before chuckling faintly.

"Now. Do you understand then, why I say you could not replicate it?"* - Mon Nov  9 12:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Maybe even study it. - Mon Nov  9 12:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, you might be able to study it- but improve on it..? While such is possible, it is not through the arts of the smith, but through me advancing my mastery of it. - Mon Nov  9 12:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And studying it would involve an awful lot of me holding it steady for you to look closer. - Mon Nov  9 12:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh. - Mon Nov  9 12:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I'd assume damage to the blade would be detrimental as well, yes? - Mon Nov  9 12:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. I'd like to avoid such, if nothing else. - Mon Nov  9 12:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'd rather not test any such theory, no? - Mon Nov  9 12:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: It's bond to be a potential issue. You and I should arrange days to study such. Perhaps I'd be able to learn -- and even improve your weapon. No matter how farfetched it may seem. - Mon Nov  9 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Perhaps. I am interested in seeing what you might learn from it, admitably. - Mon Nov  9 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Oh- and while we are here. - Mon Nov  9 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'd like to prove my claim. - Mon Nov  9 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: The other one. - Mon Nov  9 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Hrm. . ? - Mon Nov  9 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Care to give me a punch in the arm? - Mon Nov  9 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles.

"Consider it a point of pride, on my part, to prove that other statement true as well."* - Mon Nov  9 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I would never. <*He seems hesistant*> - Mon Nov  9 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ohoho? - Mon Nov  9 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Against striking a lady, is it? - Mon Nov  9 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Indeed. - Mon Nov  9 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hold back if you like- but I must insist. Just on the arm, nowhere to worry about. - Mon Nov  9 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs and nods, then shrugs.

"Ah, well. I'll just have to arrange for you to watch one of my sparring matches." She decides upon- before turning to leave.

"Anyway.. I'm off to get some sleep. Farewell for now!"* - Mon Nov  9 12:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) debates on whether or not to try and worm her way into getting a training session..

Or to finally go to sleep.

".... They, Miss Medic, are a Transvestite."* - Mon Nov  9 12:59:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) leans back against the wall- idly conjuring her sword to stare at it for a long moment- looking into the purple sheen of it's steel.

"..He's real nice to me.. but would he continue to be so if he knew..?" She drawls softly, staring at the purple blade that reflects her soul- it's edge bright and dark all at once- reflecting the sunlight on it's gleaming near-black edge...

Before she dismisses it, returning to waiting.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles and nods, drawing her sword and taking a very solid- if basic- stance with her blade in a two handed grip, low to her center of mass.

"Ready when you are."* - Mon Nov  9 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Hopefully this fight isn't too good. . .I'll get too worked up. - Mon Nov  9 21:35:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: H-How to go about this.. - Mon Nov  9 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shifts to the side- keeping her eyes forward as she moves her body out of the way of the Kunai- eyes focused on her foe. A faint smile on her lips then, as she dodges slightly...

Only to be suprised by the sudden and intense acceleration of that Kick; which impacts with the side of her face and... does nothing. Indeed, it presses against the side of Mitsunara's cheek...

And Mitsunara grins, as she brings the back of her sword upwards- slamming the blunt backend of it into her foes side to dislodge her the second after impact, just as she'd be about to spring back.

"I see! Not bad!" She says- a grin on her lips as she twists her body into the strike to dislodge the girl from her face and bring her to the ground.* - Mon Nov  9 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) calmly starts to walk forwards, flicking her blade to the side with a casual smile. The shuriken seem to skid across her body like they would across a metal target; sliding to either side and almost sparking away from her form as she advances steadily and calmly.

"Is that all..? Don't you have anyting bigger to hit me with..?" She inquires calmly- flicking her blade to the side as she reverses it in her grip. "Or do you just know how to run away." She inquires- narrowing her eyes as she steps calmly forwards, swaying with each step.* - Mon Nov  9 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces, not having noticed the wires before they curled around her- she feels them cut into her dress, then fail to scratch her skin...and is distracted momentarily, as she solidifies her stance... and breathes out.

"....Impressive- but this won't hold m-"

And then she's cut off- as the girl flies forwards. She's already switched to a one handed grip during her advance- but at the same time, her foe is just that much faster than her.

The blow hits her square in the chest- and ripples outwards, vibrating through her body... and continuing to do no noticeable harm; as Momura's hand feels like she just punched solid metal, rather than flesh...

Before her right hand snatches out to grab her foe by the shoulder, and hold her there firmly as her left winds back with the Katana, to deliver a blow to her midsection.* - Mon Nov  9 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: T-This is annoying.. - Mon Nov  9 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) isn't damaged by the force- not really.

But at the same time- a blow to the throat is a blow to the throat, and her intended headbut finisher is interupted, as she tosses the girl aside by her shoulder while staggering back, before her hand goes to rub her throat.

"Atta.. *Cough* Girl!! Now you're thinkin like a fighter!" She congratulates with a lazy smile, as this slender, lithe girl who seems to be able to reliably tank all kinds of damage turns to face where her foe was flung, coughing.* - Mon Nov  9 22:01:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) moves uncannily fast in response to the wires. She can't see where they are aimed- but she is against being bound in any way, regardless. She twists the grip in her hands even as she makes a sudden and abrupt slash to slice through the wires- or at the very least, push them away from their target so they can be avoided as she continues to advance, smiling faintly.

"You really are fighting smart." She says respectfully. "But..." She trails of, as she waits to see what her blade does to the wires.* - Mon Nov  9 22:08:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) breathes in and takes a deep breath- as she smiles up at her opponent, and takes a firm stance; blade held two handed, pointed up at her foe.

"Well..? We both know I can't go up there. Come on, keep attacking me." She offers calmly, as she leans back on her rear foot with a playful smile.* - Mon Nov  9 22:11:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shifts. She has a few moments despite her foes intense speed- simply due to having known something was coming. She once more reverses her grip on the blade as she steps back and swings upwards.

It's not enough to stop a punch to her face- but it is enough to make it a simultaneous strike to her foes midsection- with no more or less force than before. Her strike lands into her foes side- as her face actually seems to feel the strike, and the reverberations spread through her body...

But at the same time, fail to do any damage of consequence or note due to the dispersed nature of it, and her own extreme, metal-like durability. The blow hits her face, as her blade hits Momura's side mid-strike.

"WAAHAAA!!!!"* - Mon Nov  9 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: NO! - Mon Nov  9 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) flicks her blade to the side- those drops of blood flying to the side as she sighs.

"....Your spirit and determination- most admirable." She says- nodding her head respectfully as she then sheathes it, before turning to face Momura. "Are you alright?"* - Mon Nov  9 22:23:34 2015

Her body is like metal, almost- as if her skin is denser than a normal womans, despite her lithe build. She's incredibly fit and strong as she endures the blow- grinning as she steps into it, enduring the pain that she is actually caused as she swings her blade left handed- not reversed, not holding back- into her foes side, as her right jabs out for a punch to her foes face that she leans into.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as she twists her body back after delivering the punch- throwing herself to the side as she twists her Katana in the brief lock with the Kunai to slide the blade around the side for a forward thrust to wherever the blade can land as she pushes her arm forwards while using the Kunai as a fulcrum, and her blade as a lever...

As she holds her right hand back and low, ready to use it if she needs to to respond to whatever is coming next even as she turns a parried blow into a second attack.* - Mon Nov  9 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) twists the blade to scrape the edge and drive it into the hand holding it with a manic grin- as her foe twists her body into the air- and rather than try to stop the blow, or grab the leg- or do anything of the sort...

She thrusts with her free hand for a brutal uppercut to her foes chin in midair while the kick lands on her side- a full power punch that she twists her body into with a wild grin- pumping her legs to put more strength into that as she struggles to twist and cut the blade out of the grip it is in slowly. She grunts at the blow to her side- but despite it landing and causing real pain..

She doesn't seem to care- if anything, she is spurred on by the pain, by the damage- grinning wide as her fist arcs out for her foes chin in the midst of the air- intending to use the momentum of her foes own movement against her by slamming her fist in from the direction she is moving towards.* - Mon Nov  9 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) veers backwards- grunting at the impact to her shoulder- having instinctively arched her shoulder up, not to dodge the attack, but to take it on something less vulnerable than her throat- even as she is indeed forced back, and her sword yanked free of her foes hand- chuckling softly.

She cracks her shoulders as she sways back, and looks at Mizora.

"Tch.. but I can't go all out with people watching... still, I don't much care if you do..!" She admits with a lazy smile as she flicks her blade to the side to let the blood leave it; a manic grin growing on her usually expressionless face.

The gleam in those violet eyes, the grin on those lips- it's clear. She's having the time of her life, as she steadies her posture and bends her own knees, assuming the same posture she started the fight in.* - Mon Nov  9 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) looks on, as her foe shifts stance; she drops her Katana. It seems like she'll have nothing in her hands when the strike comes- as once more, she makes no attempt to dodge; not realizing what is coming her way...

As she brings down her hands as if swinging a weapon; and one forms. In the moment she is struck to her torso, she strikes to her foes left shoulder- with a blade that has far more reach than the one she just dropped to the ground.

"...Seems I'll have to show off a little.." The woman muses idly- as the purple blade cleaves downwards, formed of energy and spirit out of apparently nowhere- as it slides down through the air- sharper, far more keen than her last blade.

Unearthly steel that arcs downwards through the air. She grimaces- as the chakra jolts around inside of her body- causing a blossom of pain far more intense than anything she's felt in a while...

Even as her blade, suddenly notably sharper and even more durable, bites into her foes shoulder in the same moment...

A full length Nodachi, as she takes advantage of it's reach to land a full strike.* - Mon Nov  9 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts as she feels the first two strikes; as meanwhile, she uses her blade on her foes shoulder like a Lever.  The blade drags along the shoulder- pushing deeper as she pushes of the ground to avoid the third strike and those succeding it- as her blade pushes back and stands in front of her; angling her blade between herself and her foes attacks as she avoids the final stroke by launching herself back.

She comes to a halt; sand skidding up around her in a faint haze from the swift and potent motion, as she finds herself in more pain than she's been in in a long, long time- eyes wide with a certain glee- as blood drips from her lip due to the nature of the repeated damage...

As she takes an odd posture- holding the Nodachi at the waist and to the side as she seems to be preparing for.. /something/, now that she has some distance between herself and her foe.

"..I see.... the Byakugan, then...?" She muses softly... as the blade that is formed of both Chakra- and something very much /not/ chakra- seethes in her hands happily.* - Mon Nov  9 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I generally prefer not to use this, too.... Heh. - Mon Nov  9 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: (( All her chakra feels off- it's not quite right. The closest you can think of is probably that it seems to all be Yin Chakra- but again, not quite.)) - Mon Nov  9 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ..... - Mon Nov  9 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins wide- that odd chakra that those lacking heightened sensory abilities have no way of percieving seeping from her and her sword as a purple haze as she takes that strange posture- seemingly meant for a thrusting type attack..

Licking her lips of the blood that dripped from the earlier internal damage as she tenses her legs, and nods.

"A'right. Let's have some more fun, yeah..?" She says with a note of glee despite the increased pain flowing through her body...

Before she pushes herself off of the ground-reversing her grip on her soul sword in mid thrust... as she thrusts low- then slices directly up in a move that would be either bisecting a weaker foe- or in this case, likely just meant to leave a long cut. It is worth noting as well- that she makes full use of her reach with the huge Nodachi, not stepping within arms reach to make this brutal attack.

"WAAHAHAHAAAAA!"* - Mon Nov  9 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: He has eyes like that one guy... - Mon Nov  9 23:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) seems to literally ignore the knives- as she see's the woman moving; and taking advantage of how her reach had enabled her some distance.... and experience fighting those much faster than herself, it must be admitted... she keeps running onwards, only to plant her foot down on the second step...

And pivot- turning the slash up into a diagonal aimed at behind where she was a moment ago- assuming that this woman will attempt to do what everyone faster than her tries to do...

And attack her from behind- just like Kurt did their first spar. So she pivots- likely causing the attack to hit her in the side and miss the intended points- causing pain, but not hitting her spine to disable her...

As her blade keeps coming towards her foe from the side- though the pivot is not near fast enough to ensure mutual damage, sadly.

"Hah! Check- but no mate!" She grunts out- as more blood drips from her lips. Her motion seems to have not been a matter of being fast enough to avoid- but having predicted what was going to happen from past experience with people doing the same thing.* - Mon Nov  9 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) meanwhile, diverts her blade in the air- showing a remarkable amount of control over such a huge weapon- to put the blade between herself and the secondary attack; the weapon clashing against the Gentle fist for a moment, before she is forced back, also panting.

She pants raggedly, in fact- more damaged than she's been in a long time.. as she nods, and let's the weapon fade away into purple smoke and shadow on the breeze- gone within seconds.

"...Yeah. This is.. enough for now." She admits softly.* - Mon Nov  9 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ugh... I need a Medic, but a brief patch job.. I'd be happy to... Ugh, fuck.. - Mon Nov  9 23:59:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly- holding up a hand.. as she crouches to pick up the Katana she dropped earlier- and sheathes it smoothly- before taking the hand.

"Yeah.. let's.. head to a medic.." She says with a grin- still barely exeternally injured, after the woman was forced to resort to Jyuuken to do real damage; a broad grin on her lips as they start to walk.

"That.. was fun."* - Tue Nov 10 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Hmph. . . - Tue Nov 10 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts as she lays down on the bed- sighing as she accepts the treatment of assorted nurses. 

Thankfully- neither of the two is nesascarily seriously injured, due to their mutually insane physique and health.

"Oy vey... that was... pretty fun, huh..?" She muses aloud with a light smile.* - Tue Nov 10 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at that- and nods.

"Meanwhile... that's some pretty damaging stuff, yeah.." She says- nodding approvingly.* - Tue Nov 10 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Wanna go somewhere after this? The choice's yours. - Tue Nov 10 00:10:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) eventually- after a few pills, some treatment, and a flash or two of green light- slides out of the hospital bed, and turns to leave- waving goodbye.

"Peace out, yo."* - Tue Nov 10 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Bye.. - Tue Nov 10 00:22:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks back up, hands in her pockets.

"Anythin goin on here?"* - Tue Nov 10 00:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... I wouldn't be averse to it- but I'll need to eat after. I've caught a good bit of a breather as is, and the hospital was nice... wait, which girl are you asking if I beat? - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I fought two. - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: The darkskined one. - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I flattened the Waitress totally with no damage, then someone else stepped up and gave me a really good fight. - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Anyway.. - Tue Nov 10 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles playfully as she draws her sword with a flourish.

"Marco! You didn't believe what I had to say about my toughness, huh..? This'll be a demonstration." She states calmly, blade in hand as she lifts a Katana into a left handed grip, her right hand empty and to the side as she looks at Ivel, head tilted to the side.

"You ready, then?"* - Tue Nov 10 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: H-Hmph.. - Tue Nov 10 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles at that, sliding the Katana out in her left hand grip and nodding..

Before taking a few fluid steps forth. There is no blurring, no inhuman speed of her body- just fluid, trained, skilled motion of a determined warrior, as she makes a slash towards his shoulder with the blade leaning forth- only to pull it back after it would have made contact presuming no dodge, and hammer her right forward in a jab for the mans face.* - Tue Nov 10 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: S-She said she'd spar me. . .and she is fighting him. . . - Tue Nov 10 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Damn. - Tue Nov 10 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: Mother fucker what, I thought someone else agreed to fight you. - Tue Nov 10 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) laughs wildly as the flame arcs out at her form. It bathes over her- setting her clothes alight and damaging the fabric irreparably- leaving her robe as so much ash on the wind, revealing the red leather coat beneath it that barely covers her form.

Her blade keeps moving through the flames; a wild grin on her lips as the fire burns out to either side of her- and her skin. Her flesh is unburnt, despite the state of her garb- she looks more like she's blushing, having been warmed by the intensity of his technique.

It's an almost inhuman kind of resistance to a Ninjutsu technique- certainly, nothing normal... as she continues to keep on moving.

"I hope you have more tricks than that, Sorceror!" She booms out as her blade turns from a thrust- into a slash across as she steps further into it; coming out of the flame significantly less clothed, but undamaged.* - Tue Nov 10 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces, as she see's him begin to form actual handseals. It's simple logic that actual effort will make something stronger than a casual gesture- but at the same time...

She's cocky. She's arrogant. And she enjoys being challenged. So rather than dodge- she prays that he held back just a little... and keeps rushing- laughing wildly; a sound swallowed by the roar of flames that turn the sand it passes through to glass in a flash of insane heat.

And her blade thrusts forwards- superheated, barely holding together slag is thrusted for his chest dead on- laughing wildly as the flames pass around her...

Half-way melting the leather she was wearing beneath her dress- and scorching her flesh. The smell is awful- though she isn't set on fire in a lasting fashion, the flash of heat of being momentarily utterly immersed in such an intense fireball leaves her skin red and peeling- in some places nearly blackened as she screams out in rage and pain...

And while she still /has/ a blade; her Iron weapon melting as she strikes.... and simply tries to get one strike in with it before it fails her, as her right hook is shortly following it for his jawline as she erupts from the flames- in horrific pain, agony even...

But somehow, both still standing, and still alive.* - Tue Nov 10 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) gasps in pain as he somehow not only stops her blade with a hand- but erects a shield of flames around himself. Her right hook keeps arcing for his face- the flames of the shroud in it's way.. as her blade is stopped by his hand and held... and she puts every iota of strength she can into that one right hook for the side of his face.

It's a hell of a punch- as it breaks through the fire shroud almost /easily/- as if she doesn't notice the flames burning her knuckles and fist- not after the flames he already bathed her in...

Pain wracks the brutish womans body as she keeps moving- and whether that punch lands or not... this fight is over.

"...Heh.... shit, that was.... sure. Let's be.. freinds." She agrees softly... her voice suprisingly quiet for someone who must be in body wracking pain.* - Tue Nov 10 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: *drops perks from pocket* - Tue Nov 10 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) calmly chuckles faintly as she...

Sways from side to side for a moment- shaking his hand briefly.. sheathing her Katana..

Then falling back. Her third fight of the day- and the only one she could be said to have really definitively lost. She collapses onto her back- audibly snoring within moments.* - Tue Nov 10 01:07:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) rubs her side, grunting as she pulls herself up the wall, then looks towards the scene before her- before looking to Chikyu.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) picks herself up off the ground, stretching out and turning to head to the gate.* - Tue Nov 10 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) takes up position by the gate, leaning against the sheer rock clff-face as she does, grimacing at the pain she is still in- that is still slowly fading away after those strange pills she tooks. She breathes in, then out, as she rests against the wall and looks out- eyes alert for anyone oncoming towards the village.* - Tue Nov 10 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: S'up fodder.. - Tue Nov 10 02:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) waves, leaning against the wall.

"You here for guard duty too, or just your own health?" She inquires calmly. It's worth noting that she seems to have recovered suprisingly quickly, after that pill- then again, she was very resellient even in the fight.

"Either way- pull up a hunk of wall, eh? Names Mitsunara, by the way- not fodder."* - Tue Nov 10 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly.

"I didn't say shit about my own health, I mentioned yours- but it's whatever." She says- shrugging before chuckling. "Anyway. Getting away from the bullshit, huh? Fair enough." She says calmly, sighing.

"So. What's up with you? You seem glum."* - Tue Nov 10 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shrugs, calmly nodding.

"Mrm... Things, huh..? Care to talk about it? I'm a pretty good listener, and something of an amateur psychologist at times. I might be able to help you out."* - Tue Nov 10 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) brushes her hair back and nods slowly- listening calmly. She turns- and with a sweet, compassionate smile... a gentle, gleam in her eyes.

"Why would you hate yourself.. for what others did to you..? Why would you wallow in misery- when you could throw yourself into revenge..? I can promise you- killing whoever did it? Killling whoever took them from you..? That'll feel better than anything else you could possibly do right now." She s ays- smiling with an almost childish innocence in her face- and yet her words are suggesting brutal murder...

"I'm not kidding. The messier the better, when it comes to revenge."* - Tue Nov 10 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Behind bars..?  - Tue Nov 10 03:17:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs, leaning back against the wall and shaking her head.

"Anyway..."  She shrugs, as she speaks on.

"As for nothing fixing that feeling... I suppose so. So why go on?"* - Tue Nov 10 03:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Because I know she wants me to... - Tue Nov 10 03:20:32 2015

"Headed out?"* - Tue Nov 10 03:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ..Nothing at all.. - Tue Nov 10 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) crooks an eyebrow as she looks at Ai, tilting her head to the side.

"There is nothing at all that you enjoy."* - Tue Nov 10 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: No..Nothing.. - Tue Nov 10 03:35:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) closes her eyes... and slowly but surely...

Begins to snore.* - Tue Nov 10 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) yawns as, after a very short nap, she stirs back to awareness.

"....Fuck, I passed out, didn't I..? Heh... sloth sure is a bitch.."* - Tue Nov 10 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out as she straightens out her posture, rubbing her eyes and looking around- squinting.

"Good thing I don't seem to have missed anything.." She muses as she scratches the side of her head, leaning back against the wall with a curious expression on her face as she looks around the area, thoughtful and composed.* - Tue Nov 10 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out- looking around as she does.

She takes a few steps out from the gate- and starts to walk back and forth in smooth lines- eyes roaming around to keep an eye on things, hands in her pockets at first.

As she does so, she contemplates her earlier defeat at the hands of that kid...

"Tch... that wasn't natural, no way.." She muses aloud- thinking on the insane fire abilities the kid used against her.* - Tue Nov 10 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs, tilting her head back as she looks around, tucking her hands into her pockets...

"Anyway.. my shift is about done. I guess I'm outa here.." She muses- turning to head back into town.* - Tue Nov 10 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks into the Mansion- humming placidly as she does, hands at her sides. Her garb is scorched at the rims, and she still smells faintly of smoke from what she was doing before guard duty- but it's been a good while anyway. She salutes Hassan lazily as she walks in, a half smile on her face.

"Yo, Kazekage-Sama-Senpai-sensei-Kun. I believe my shift of guard duty is over, yeah man?"* - Tue Nov 10 04:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I wasn't exactly going to argue with a Jounin, on accont of valuing my life, so... I figured I'd just report that to you and hope it was, in fact, sanctioned. - Tue Nov 10 04:44:09 2015
