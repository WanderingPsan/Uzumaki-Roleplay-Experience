<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) whistles quietly, observing from her perch atop the cliff, chin resting on her hands as she looks at the scene.

"That was just.. silly..." She muses idly from above.* - Tue Nov  3 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: No he meant the guy. - Tue Nov  3 23:11:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares at Aklys, head tilted to the side as the mans overwhelming BR radiates in waves. Still- she is well aware that after that battle, she can be sure this man is far, far out of her league.

She tilts her head to the other side and sighs.

"So why are you here, then..?"* - Tue Nov  3 23:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, tiring of this battle. It has nothing to do with her, she decides- as she hops down from the cliff she's been perched on to flicker away, forming the tiger seal as she falls, and seeming to dissapear from the area in a few moments.* - Wed Nov  4 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs as she stretches out in the main square, leaning back into a relaxed posture. Her intent is simple- practice her main jutsu some more. She tenses- focusing intently as she breathes in, then out.

It's a flowing motion she's been working to get the hang of for some time now- as she let's her hand drop to her Katana's hilt, then pulls it back up; forming that single handseal; shunting her body in a flicker as she tries to move her hand in that state to grab her sword.

As once more, it turns out like usual- with her coming out of the flicker, then as a seperate motion drawing her sword. She bows her head at the failure, drooping slightly as she pulls back from the motion. A sigh escapes her lips, as she bows her head and takes a deep breath; calming herself as she works through the dizziness before stepping back to her ready point..* - Wed Nov  4 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) slides back; and after a long moment of assuming her former starting position, takes a smooth breath.. and this time crouches... before leaping upwards as she forms the handseal; a flying kick through the air this time being what she attempts to synchronize with her shunshin.

As she comes out of this and lands by skidding on the ground, she grimaces... then nods slightly.

"Easier, because the kick uses no hands... but more dangerous; that's an all out kinda attack.." She muses aloud as she pushes herself up to stand from that position once more.* - Wed Nov  4 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) seems to be in the middle of a training routine as Ai approaches; one hand on her swords hilt that leavees it to form a single seal with her other, as she flickers forwards in a blur; and her hand shifts just a little faster to her sword, as she draws it out for a stroke.

She sighs, as once more the delay and dizziness of draw as she comes out of the flicker are too much for a truly instant action.

"...Still.. closer.." She murmurs with a faint smile. "Heya, AI-kun."* - Wed Nov  4 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Wed Nov  4 00:52:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Yes... he does - Wed Nov  4 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles faintly, as she stirs from her meditation to resume her training; once more forming that singular seal for Shunshin to project herself forwards before drawing her sword in a flowing motion.

It's a manner of seconds rather than minutes between drawing the sword and flickering; but it's still too large a gap for her.

She sways a bit- moderately dizzy.. but then nods, sheathing her sword and stepping back to her begining stance once more.

"Mrm... Ah, your back Ai."* - Wed Nov  4 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mmmhmm--By the way, Ketsuki, this is Jiki, Jiki, this is Ketsuki. - Wed Nov  4 01:57:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: There he goes again - Wed Nov  4 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and nods in response to that, as she tenses for another attempt at flickering.

"Right... Heh." She murmurs, as she tenses to move, smiling gently.

"So, Jiki? What do you do around here, then?" She inquires; as she forms the Tiger seal; flashing forwards in a flicker of movement that lacks the special effects or smoke of some people's Shunshin's- as she comes to a rest before drawing her sword in a smooth diagonal slash..

Stepping forwards after that to bring it back down, before sheathing it and walking back.

"Ugh.. still not there.."* - Wed Nov  4 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Where is Yan? - Wed Nov  4 02:25:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: What do you do now, other than just chill..? - Wed Nov  4 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Nothin' really. I do just that. The retirement life is sorta peaceful. - Wed Nov  4 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) calmly nods as she listens to the man- nodding slowly. She chuckles softly as she tenses to repeat her training exercise.

"I see.. Peaceful, huh..? Sound's nice, for someone whose done fighting." She admits softly- as she forms the handseal again; flickering forwards and once more trying to draw the sword within a second of flickering; this time coming impercetibally closer.

"...Phew.. this sure is tiring.."* - Wed Nov  4 02:31:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grins faintly at that, stretching out as she adjusts the sword on her hip and nods, holding out a hand with a diamond ring on it.

"Mhrm."* - Wed Nov  4 03:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Right. - Wed Nov  4 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: So...Why are you guys just lolligagging around in the barracks? - Wed Nov  4 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I've actually been training out here, for a while now. Not sure about everyone else. - Wed Nov  4 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I wanna see you kids get your asses in gear. - Wed Nov  4 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'll hand out some missions so let's go. - Wed Nov  4 04:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) continues to do what she has been doing as she talks; forming another tiger handseal to flicker forwards.

Utilizing Shunshin to move forwards, she flickers through the air before drawing a Katana; then as Hassan mentions missions.. she blinks a few times.

"Missions, huh..? I don't live here, but..." She coughs a few times. "I'm not doing anything important." She says as she is in the process of drawing the sword after the flicker.* - Wed Nov  4 04:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I know you don't. - Wed Nov  4 04:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: That doesn't mean no one else does. - Wed Nov  4 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So I don't suppose I could do a mission while I'm here..? - Wed Nov  4 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: *Coughs* - Wed Nov  4 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Nope. - Wed Nov  4 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Damn. I hate taking breaks.. - Wed Nov  4 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You arent a registered Sunagakure Soldier. - Wed Nov  4 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I am engaged to one! If that.. helps? Seriously, training is boring. - Wed Nov  4 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Sorry. - Wed Nov  4 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: My wife was engaged to me. - Wed Nov  4 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Didn't mean anything military wise. - Wed Nov  4 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Drat. Ah, well. I think you and I are the only ones where not trapped in some kind of trance, too. - Wed Nov  4 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Everyone else seems to be just staring off into space... - Wed Nov  4 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I work them to exhaustion. - Wed Nov  4 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: There usually isnt a time where they arent training. - Wed Nov  4 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles as she retraces her steps back to her starting point, taking in a deep breath as she takes a few moments to cope with the chakra drain from her Shunshin; before she once more forms the tiger seal, and endeavors to attack as quickly after flickering as she possibly can.

Her blade once more only cuts the air a few seconds after she flickers; rather than the instant response time she wants to do.

"...I see. Heh. So kinda like how I make myself operate back home." She muses idly as she sheathes the sword after that single slash, and starts to re-trace her steps.* - Wed Nov  4 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: They are soldiers - Wed Nov  4 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: They are required to be at top strength at all times. - Wed Nov  4 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hassan, mission me. - Wed Nov  4 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: There we go. - Wed Nov  4 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Some enthusiasm. - Wed Nov  4 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Oh? Another class mission? I wonder what I'll teach them this time. - Wed Nov  4 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Deez nutz? - Wed Nov  4 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Anywho. - Wed Nov  4 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*scratches his nose*> - Wed Nov  4 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'm going to go scout for a bit, Hassan. - Wed Nov  4 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs after a while of recovering; resuming her training regimine as per usual.. as she forms a handseal while stepping forwards; lunging into a blurringly fast Shunshin before moving to swing her sword in a two handed sweep.

The blade blurs forwards, as she swings initially in a horizontal sweep, before slashing up diagonally, then back down vertically in a firm pattern as she takes three steps forwards.. before pausing and taking a deep breath.

She sheathes the blade and returns to her standing position, sighing. "Still not quick enough.."* - Wed Nov  4 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Ketsuki. - Wed Nov  4 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, Ai-Kun? - Wed Nov  4 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Want a clone to train with? - Wed Nov  4 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? As an opponent, you mean..? - Wed Nov  4 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That would be welcome. - Wed Nov  4 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Alright but this clone is around half my power so. - Wed Nov  4 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Be careful. - Wed Nov  4 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Probably still stronger 'n me.. Heh. Still, we'll see. - Wed Nov  4 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: One good hit and put it down. - Wed Nov  4 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. - Wed Nov  4 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hassan.. - Wed Nov  4 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'd like for you to accompany us to your office to discuss the current events. - Wed Nov  4 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Right. - Wed Nov  4 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Anyone seen Fujitora? - Wed Nov  4 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods, smiling as her lover kisses her goodbye, before turning to walk a short distance from the clone- and bow...

Even as papers fly into a barrier guard around the Shadow clone; bringing a faint smile to  Ketsuki's face.

"So, you think I can't break past that, huh..?" She murmurs softly as she looks on, tensing herself for battle. "Let's see." She says firmly at the half power clone, grinning as the real Ai walks away..

As once more, she flickers; this time dropping out of it a short distance behind the clone... 

The clone that hears her drawing her sword after she flickers into position behind it, and turns to direct a barrage of paper shuriken before Ketsuki can even finish drawing her sword; drawing a grimace from the Swordswoman, as she is forced to duck to the side; avoiding most of the Ten Shuriken barrage, and enduring a few of them that seem unable to break her skin as she rolls to the side, sword now drawn.

"Tch.."* - Wed Nov  4 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: What are we doing - Wed Nov  4 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces after enduring the paper shuriken volley; even as the clone raises it's hand to guide more of those paper sheets after her; waves of paper shuriken that seem to be following her, rather than simply being flung. She tenses against the ground; and launches herself in a flying kick on the clone.

She soars briefly through the air; as more paper shuriken fail to cut past her skin, lacking the force to penetrate or cut her as she lands the kick against the barrier of paper, which has solidified before her. She braces against it there; even as she causes parts of the paper to rip from physical impact..

Before leaping away; just as the figure begins to form handseals that Ketsuki doesn't recognize...

As a Fireball erupts out of a break in the paper barrier towards her, alarming Ketsuki as she rolls to the side- narrowly avoiding being struck by it, as a crater is left in the earth next to where she lands.

"Tsk.."* - Wed Nov  4 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) makes another charge shortly after landing, shifting the iron blade in her hand to a two handed grip as she crouches- and begins to rush towards the paper barrier guarded clone that has yet to actually take a single step; as another volley of Shuriken is launched. She grimaces- as she knows she simply cannot dodge the homing attacks of the paper shuriken; as she simply relies on her bodies intense durability from physical training to endure the barrage...

Ten shuriken more, as she rolls with the attack to endure it.

Grimacing as she feels the pain of impact, even as they continue to fail to penetrate her skin for now, as she makes a two handed sweep with her sword; once more cutting through a handful of sheets of paper; but not reaching the clone as layers of barrier line up to parry her strike.

"Gah.."* - Wed Nov  4 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Hey everybody. - Wed Nov  4 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Hey yo Sanoke what elemets do you know besides earth? - Wed Nov  4 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) continues her battle with the Shadow clone of Ai-Kun. She grimaces as she looks at the place where her blade failed to pierce; as the paper guard then slides out to the sides to let a fireball loose at her from the clones mouth, as she grimaces; slamming her sword into a sheathe as she forms a single handseal to flicker away to avoid the fireball; barely able to finish the single seal in time to avoid the close-range attack.

She's panting lightly as she comes out of the flicker a short distance away from the clone, grimacing as she reaches back for her sword.

"This is... exhausting... and annoying."* - Wed Nov  4 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) steels herself as she stares at the clone that seems to be able to endure her attacks through simply using that paper guard, even as it gestures to raise more paper to attack her with; bringing a faint grin to her lips.

"Wish I could make these for myself... seem real useful." She muses idly as the paper guard parts to launch more Shuriken. She grins as Kuro greets her, nodding back.

"Hey, Kuro. Yeah- sure has! Moment- training with someone elses clone..!" She explains; as she tucks in to roll to the side; avoiding a few of the Shuriken at first, before they whizz to follow her like guided missles; once more impacting her body and dealing only blunt damage as they fail to penetrate her toughened skin; even as she hops out of the crouch to push her blade for a stab towards the clone's paper barrier.

"Bit distracted!"* - Wed Nov  4 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Greetings Kuro. - Wed Nov  4 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces as she pushes the Katana through a few layers of paper; but fails to reach the clone yet again; pushing her blade in, she is forced to once more roll away as a point blank attack launches at her; letting go of the sword and leaving the iron weapon wedged inside the barriers as she launches back; forming a single handseal to evade another fireball with a wheeze.

"Well.. at least as a clone.. it'll eventually disperse just from running out of chakra, yeah..?" She murmurs with a wince. "It can't have her full reserves.. so it must be getting low by now..." She tells herself as she once more narrowly avoids a fireball with Shunshin.

"On the other hand, so am I.." She murmurs as she realizes she has left her weapon wedged in her foes guard.* - Wed Nov  4 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'd figured you'd have went to go on a journey of some sorts. - Wed Nov  4 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) looks at the thing before her... then grins. She realizes something; as the blade wedged in two layers of paper seems to have stopped the two layers from rotating around quite so quickly. She tenses, as she leaps forwards; flying foot first through the air as she puts her foot forwards...

"I am done with this clone!" She insists firmly, as she launches herself like a projectile; as Shuriken once more are launched in a barrage that skids across her skin- failing to penetrate once more, as she feels the dull pain against her skin, but keeps going...

As her foot lands on the hilt of her sword, pushing it through to impact the clone and draw blood.

Enough to disperse it, finally, as she kicks back as the entire clone falls into smoke and her blade clatters to the ground, as she flips back from the kick.

"Phew.. exhausting."* - Wed Nov  4 05:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sorry about that, Kuro. - Wed Nov  4 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So, sup? - Wed Nov  4 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Nothing much, and it's alright. - Wed Nov  4 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I thought you were a shinobi from Konoha, what brings you here? - Wed Nov  4 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah.. well.. - Wed Nov  4 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I guess you could say I fell in love, and well... I came by here to visit Ai-Kun for a while. - Wed Nov  4 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Thenn he proposed.. - Wed Nov  4 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So I guess I'll be here for a while before I head back to Konoha. - Wed Nov  4 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We're not actually sure yet.. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He proposed, and I said yes, but we don't have a date.. as for being too young.. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I'm pretty much an adult- and.. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Shinobi have a habit of dying young. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I guess we're both sure enough about our feelings that we want to live while we can. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You're one dumb adult. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Eh? - Wed Nov  4 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles faintly as Reguel heals her, and shrugs.

"I'm not really hurt, anyway." She says calmly- a faint smile on her face as she is mended of the minor bruises she entailed- her stunning physical fitness seemingly having carried her through the battle with the clone.* - Wed Nov  4 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Good for you. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I knew people like you. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Besides, it was good training. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Their dead now. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Huh? - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Eh? - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: People like me? What's that supposed to mean..?! - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: It means what it means. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I think he's trying to say, take better care of yourself. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) squints at Reguel... then chuckles and shrugs.

"I guess- but I do take good care of myself. It's why I work myself so hard out here, when I'm not in real danger- so that I'm as strong as I can be when the real battles come."* - Wed Nov  4 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's better if a real battle never comes.. - Wed Nov  4 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Agreed. - Wed Nov  4 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmph. - Wed Nov  4 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Peace is always preferable- but it's not always possible. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's possible. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: People just don't believe it is. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: It gives me more of a chance to operate on people. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sometimes, other people will just not let you live peacefully, or avoid battle. Even if you want to- sometimes, you can't. Because if you do..? - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: If you stand aside- often times, it can just let bad people do what they want, without contest. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Because sadly, there are people in this world who wish others ill- who want to hurt others, for their own benefit. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And if you just stand aside and /let/ those people do what they want, you're just as guilty as they are. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That's what I believe, anyway. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I don't care. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And I wasn't talking to you. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You're talking around me. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yare Yare Daze.. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm sure Kuro wouldn't mind if I slice open your muscles. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That a threat, then? - Wed Nov  4 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: If you want to take it as a threat sure. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I mean, I'm not sure why else you would bring up slicing open my muscles. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Can we please stop arguing? - Wed Nov  4 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Who knows? - Wed Nov  4 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sounds good to me, Kuro. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) thinks: What an idiot. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: And in this world, if you don't have power to back up your words, nothing will be done. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: If only Koeki didn't die. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Agreed... sadly. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's why, when I become the leader of the temple, I'm going to use my strength to spread peace. - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Then again I was in Kumogakure so by then I probably couldn't get the training I needed. - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Right now, I don't have enough strength. - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Use strength.. to spread peace. - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So you're going to bring peace while beating someone's skull in? - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No. - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And how do yo uintend to do something like that..? - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's not the strength I'm referring to. - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: He's a pacifist, if you haven't noticed. - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I want the strength to protect. I want to be just like Yukio. He has the strength to protect his views. - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If I have enough strength, I can solve conflict without taking another's life. - Wed Nov  4 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Strength isn't only in physical prowess. Strength comes in different forms, courage, words, resolve.    - Wed Nov  4 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Will, spirit. Mhrm. - Wed Nov  4 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares at the man for a long moment- then sighs.

"Good luck, is all I can wish you. Still- he's already killed so many people. Do you really think that just talking him out of doing it more would be enough to stop retribution for what he's already done? He's killed hundreds of people, after all.."* - Wed Nov  4 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I can only hope. - Wed Nov  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: In the case that words won't reach him, then I'll just stop him with my two hands.  - Wed Nov  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Kuro, when I finish my training I might as well come with you. - Wed Nov  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Of course, I dont' mean taking his life. - Wed Nov  4 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That would be helpful. - Wed Nov  4 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: By the way, what do you two know about Edge so far? - Wed Nov  4 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I know what he did to Kumogakure, and that's about it.. - Wed Nov  4 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: ..... - Wed Nov  4 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You know. - Wed Nov  4 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I thought I purged that from my memory. - Wed Nov  4 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: And you brought it back up. - Wed Nov  4 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I met the guy. - Wed Nov  4 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You did? - Wed Nov  4 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What did he seem like? - Wed Nov  4 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: He's pretty odd. - Wed Nov  4 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: How so? - Wed Nov  4 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well we had a breif conversation so I can't really tell you. - Wed Nov  4 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What made him feel odd? - Wed Nov  4 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Don't worry about it. - Wed Nov  4 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Besides it's been a while I'm surprised I still remember it. - Wed Nov  4 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh..Alright then. - Wed Nov  4 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) eventually, rises from her rest to stretch out, and tense herself. She listens in- then speaks calmly.

"When you spoke to Edge, did he /seem/ like the kind of guy to go on mass murdering rampages?" She idly inquires as she forms the Tiger Seal to flicker forwards, before reaching to draw her blade a second after she snaps out of the flicker; before moving to sheathe it.* - Wed Nov  4 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slowly as she responds to that, thinking on how to process that, even as she flickers back to her starting position after sheathing her blade- nodding along as he speaks.

"I see... so nothing of note, just a casual meeting." She muses idly as she skids back in the thing; barely seeming to notice the dizziness anymore.

"Mrm.."* - Wed Nov  4 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: However looks can be decieving. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That is true.. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I mean you wouldn't think I have a justu that can kill someone. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Very true... - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Oh, no. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Are you? - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Medics are very likely to be good at killing you. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: They know how to put you together- of course they can take you apart. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I have no idea what the Jutsu /is/. - Wed Nov  4 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But I am sure there is one. - Wed Nov  4 06:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Why are we speaking of killing as if it were nothing? - Wed Nov  4 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm..? How do you mean? - Wed Nov  4 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Kuro, do you know how many people I've killed in order to protect myself? - Wed Nov  4 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No. - Wed Nov  4 06:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles gently and nods. She's a pale faced, thin little thing; her black hair framing a pale face and setting it off with sheer contrast.

"....Yes, so far I am." She says with a gente smile and a serene air.* - Wed Nov  4 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: As for that.. very well, miss. - Wed Nov  4 09:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles faintly, hands in her coat pockets as she looks at Sanoke.

"I don't know- I took to the Katana because it seemed efficient."* - Wed Nov  4 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It is. - Wed Nov  4 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sometimes, your fist just isn't enough. But most people -- save for genetic freaks -- can't take a hit from a Katana. - Wed Nov  4 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mhrm. Especially with a good strong arm behind it. - Wed Nov  4 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Glad, I just stick to a simple sword. - Wed Nov  4 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) laughs softly at the mans chosen words, shrugging at that.

"Having really good sex with Ai, reading novels..." She trails of, tapping her chin as she thinks on an answer, smiling faintly. "I guess fighting falls into doing badass things, but that really is my main hobby- combat.." She muses idly.* - Wed Nov  4 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Oh! - Wed Nov  4 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And I like reading all sorts of material, really.. Oh, that and.. - Wed Nov  4 09:32:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Eating Spicy food is also very nice... Heh. - Wed Nov  4 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Seems legit -- Yess! Food, that shit is great. - Wed Nov  4 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Training is cool too. I train a lot. Shame there aren't a lot interesting opponents to face. - Wed Nov  4 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) yawns idly, chuckling at their reactions in obvious amusement.

"Mrm... I especially love a good Mahou Tofu, as spicy as they come."* - Wed Nov  4 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Never heard of that. - Wed Nov  4 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's a very, very spicy meat dish with pasta. - Wed Nov  4 09:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But made entirely out of spicy materials. - Wed Nov  4 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles at the double entendre.

"Well, I'm well spoken for, I assure you- but I'm always game for a fight. Still; I'll admit. I'm only a moderately above average Genin- I hope I can give the two of you a good fight, as I am." She teases idly, yawning and stretching out.* - Wed Nov  4 09:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Bwah! - Wed Nov  4 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nah. - Wed Nov  4 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's a double entendre; when you say something that can be interpreted one of two ways, while meaning one but not the other. - Wed Nov  4 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So that people THINK you mean the other one. - Wed Nov  4 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's a kind of joke - Wed Nov  4 09:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: .... - Wed Nov  4 09:43:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its not very funny.... Boo Sanoke. - Wed Nov  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh. - Wed Nov  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Ergh. . Girls are weird. I won't question it. - Wed Nov  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: How about it, then? - Wed Nov  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Miss? - Wed Nov  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: YOu and me against him, two on one? - Wed Nov  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles faintly as she turns to face Sanoke, cracking her shoulders as she leans back, hands at the ready to move fluidly.

"I'd be game even if it was one on one."* - Wed Nov  4 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Eh, I'll give the youngster sometime to respond. - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I'm so confused! - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Since you're only a genin, how much do you want me to hold back? - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: However much you want to, Sanoke.. And Miss. - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He's challenging us to a fight. - Wed Nov  4 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Because he was trying to do a play on words. - Wed Nov  4 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I'm gonna...go take a seat. - Wed Nov  4 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Seems this will be one on one. - Wed Nov  4 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So- you mind if I go all out, then? - Wed Nov  4 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That is- if you're holding back, Sanoke. - Wed Nov  4 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. Sure, sure. - Wed Nov  4 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: -- And I wasn't doing a play on words. I was just copying what you guys said. - Wed Nov  4 09:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles in response to that- nodding calmly as she lifts her hands to form her handseals. She starts to go as if to form the seal for Shunshin like usual; the tiger seal.. then adds another seal- forming a Genjutsu of all things as she locks eyes with Sanoke.

"Let's dance." She states with a lazy grin- as a rain of black leaves begins to surround her foe, even as she takes a step to the side, preparing for battle as the rain of black leaves falls from the skies around her foe- acting as the trigger for an oncoming Genjutsu to initiate the primal fear reaction by showing her foe his nightmares as she steps before, humming idly.

"A'right?~"* - Wed Nov  4 10:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs, as her foe forms the handsign... taking the chance to form a single sign of her own; flickering to a position behind him silently and in a momentt.

She doesn't respond verbally as she draws her sword in transit, grimacing.

It's something she's still training in; and there's a notable delay between her arrival at the end of the flicker, to any actual stroke... but still. The Iron blade rattles free of her sheathe in a smooth, fluid motion as she pivots on her foot in the sand; blade slashing diagonally towards her foes hip to shoulder.

She's laxly smiling as she moves despite herself; even as the strain grows on her body in the transit.* - Wed Nov  4 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks as the man seems to evade without visible effort; leaving her to actually stagger through the air where her foe was a mere moment ago, as her blade pushes through the air where he was; a grimace on her lip as she plants a foot down into the sand where he was; as his blade cuts at her pants leg.

"Fast.." She murmurs; her focus clearly intent as the Genin takes another step forwards to follow up; pivoting her body to the left as she swings to the right- thus putting her body behind the strike fully as the blade whips itself towards Sanoke's body once more.

"Tch.... if this is you holding back.." The young genin murmurs as she pushes herself behind the follow up slash. "You must really be something going all out..." She drawls as she pushes the two handed slash forwards, grimacing.* - Wed Nov  4 10:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces as their blades clash- and a mere kunai holds back her Katana. She grimaces at the two handed grip being defeated one handed; before staggering back in Recoil- grimacing as she let's go of the blade with her right to reach into her coat for something else... still holding the Katana one handed as she sways backwards..

Then grimacing as the man send's a Jutsu directly at her. She rolls out two small purple objects from her coat along the sand; a fluid motion flinging them before the mud impacts her.

"Gyah- the he-!?" 

She barely manages to cry anything out as she's forced back by the flow of mud; even as the two spheres likely detonate on impact with the ground near him; into a growing cloud of purple smoke, even as she staggers away.

"Ninjutsu, too..?" She murmurs as the smoke clouds her vision of him- and hopefully, his vision of her, as she steadies herself firmly.* - Wed Nov  4 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) takes a deep breath, as she sheathes her Katana to begin strapping layered explosive tags- three at the moment- around a Kunai's hilt. She sways back; grimacing as she holds herself up in the mud flow. 

She hear's his taunting words, then- and flings the Kunai, with the tags set to detonate upon impact with something as she steps to the side- eyes on the cloud of smoke as she staggers to the side..

She knows it's just a spar; but at the same time, she can't help but want to curse her own weakness and frailty compared to the former Chuunin who seems to be effortlessly dominating her.

Still- it's a determined gleam; determined to at least land a single hit of note in this battle- that shines in her eyes as she waits for the detonation to sound.* - Wed Nov  4 10:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces as the Kunai- as, perhaps, expected- misses anything, and explodes a short distance behind Sanoke in the sand, sending up a cloud of sand that does absolutely nothing of value in the background of the fight.

She knows she can't possibly do anything to this man at this rate; but at the same time, she hates the idea of that, the idea of being completely pointless in a fight, of having no chance of even landing a hit.

She hates being weak- but at the same time, it's all she ever seems to be in any real fight; even against other Genin, she cant' seem to win for as long as she remembers.

She steps forwards as the smoke clears; but then the wind reaches her, as well; and forces her to halt. She keeps her ground; grimacing as her feet sink into the sand, and a dull pain spreads through her body from resisting head on rather than going with the flow of the wind...

But she refuses to accept that and simply be blown back. She hunches down, drawing her sword slowly as the Jutsu pins her down and to the spot.

"Gyah... Godamnit.."* - Wed Nov  4 11:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces at his words. She's pinned down, but still standing as she draws her sword back into a two handed grip. As he begins to form a clone of the mud, she tenses against the ground- feet pressing into the sand and mud.

"Sorry, but I'm still moving- I won't stand down.. without even landing a single hit!" She insists- as she sweeps the blade towards the clone, intending to at least disperse it for a moment as she moves to push herself past it- stepping forwards with a gleam in her eyes as she keeps moving.

"COMEEE ONN!" She says with a fierce grin; baring her gleaming white teeth as she sweeps the blade towards the clone as she steps past it- hoping to escape dealing with the clone to engage Sanoke- a fierce gleam in her eyes.* - Wed Nov  4 11:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) II  It was then that Ketsuki knew.

She fucked up.

Ketsuki crouches, sword in hand- and does something perhaps utterly stupid, but at the same time utterly unexpected. It's something completely seperate from her earlier style of attack- to an almost comedic degree, as she tenses against the ground- leaping upwards..

Into a flying kick. It's a high speed, sudden, flying kick aimed directly for Sanoke's face, as she holds her Katana in both hands over her head the entire trip- likely intending to deliver some kind of follow up upon impact.

But surely, such a ludicrous and headstrong manuvear won't actually work?* - Wed Nov  4 11:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grins as her kick makes impact; as she makes to then launch herself off of him, while bringing her sword down on his shoulder in the process... a grin on her lips as she comes down to the ground to complete the heavy overhand stroke she had kept readied while flying at him.

And then everything goes hazy- as she feels as if she is being pulled down into the ground.

"Wait, what..!?" She protests- eyes widening at what she assumes is another Earth Jutsu to convert the earth into quicksand; a snarl on her lips as she tries to leap free, tensing her legs to launch herself straight up into the air..

And then her ankles are grabbed- and she is yanked down with a brief roar of protest.

"NANNII!?"* - Wed Nov  4 11:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: THE FUCK?! - Wed Nov  4 11:31:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..Anyway, I guess with me fully immobilized, you've won huh? - Wed Nov  4 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces as she is patted on the head- glaring at him.

"...Yeah. I only entered the academy a few months ago, as it is.." She admits, sighing and hanging her head. "Before that, I hadn't really wanted to be a Shinobi but... I guess you could say that some things happened that changed my mind." She admits softly, sighing as she tilts her head back in the sand.

"...So are you going to actually let me outa here..?!" She squeeks in rage- then blinks as Chikyu pats her head. "...Yeah, yeah- but the fact that people my own age outmatch me is a problem in and of itself.."* - Wed Nov  4 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: 'Course- you don't think I'd actually give up because of something like this, do you..?! Now seriously.. - Wed Nov  4 11:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I regret to inform you.. - Wed Nov  4 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I kinda don't know how to. - Wed Nov  4 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..... - Wed Nov  4 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: WHAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTT!? - Wed Nov  4 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) narrows her eyes at Sanoke and thinks for a moment.

"Right... so you pulled me into the earth with no idea how to get me out.." She says- her eyebrows twitching as the sword is stabbed into the ground near her face... as she takes a deep breath- and starts to exert herself against the loose sand.

"Thankfully.. sand is kinda loose!" She says with a grin.. as she wiggles out.. /something/.. "And thankfully, I'm tough enough to take THIS point blank!" She declares...

As she then detonates a pair of explosive tags point blank against herself to excavate the earth, then crawls out of the smoking crater- coughing, but uninjured.* - Wed Nov  4 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Oy vey... - Wed Nov  4 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles at that, turnin to look at Chikyu.

"Oh, you okay?" She inquires with a lax smile.* - Wed Nov  4 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods, smiling gently as she stretches out, coughing a bit more.

"Ah.. glad to hear it, Mhrm." She says warmly, before looking towards Sanoke- and thus noticing Ume and waving at the pale woman, smiling warmly.

"Oh! Hiya miss! What brings you here to the Arena..?"* - Wed Nov  4 11:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks at that, tilting her head to the side curiously at those words as she scratches the side of her head.

"Hrm..? So you're not from around here, huh?"* - Wed Nov  4 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Neither am I. - Wed Nov  4 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: So she's allowed to stay? - Wed Nov  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm only allowed to stay fourty eight hours... - Wed Nov  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah... Two days, huh..? I'm hre visiting a very close freind... - Wed Nov  4 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Still, I'm only here for so long myself. It's nice to meet you, regardless- I'm Ketsuki, you are? - Wed Nov  4 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles gently.

"I'm from Konoha. Are you in need of a place to stay..? If that's why you're here- I would be happy to pay for a Caravan to take you to Konoha; it's a pretty peaceful, safe place- and I'm sure you could find a home there easily."* - Wed Nov  4 12:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*glances to Chiyku*> Huh? What's rude? -- Wait. . . I think she means the comment about Hassan. - Wed Nov  4 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh. - Wed Nov  4 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, I see. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So you're a wanderer, then? - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Our...Kazekage is....well... I don't know. I haven't met him. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm from Kirigakure.... it is not safe there. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: So a peasant girl was required to meet him...but his own people haven't met him. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Kiri. . .Yeah. I saw one of my friends dead not too long ago. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah..? What happened...? Are you okay..? For that matter- would you like someone to keep you company while you're here? I know that wandering alone can be really unpleasant. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: It would have been nice for him to know how I entered the village....he assumed a broke in and it made for a bad first impression. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Damn. She's really friendly. - Wed Nov  4 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Wow.... that's messed up. I can see why things might have gone poorly, then. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It happens. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I doubt it would change anything.... - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I suppose he said you could gather supplies and get a change of clothes- thus the two days- then leave, huh? - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Probably not. He -really- doesn't like strangers. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Coming to his village. And it makes sense. . .sometimes. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I suppose it is true to say that.. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Yeah.... well... considering he expressed he is from Kiri... it was rather insulting to have me turned away so quickly. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Like one time, there was this Bone guy that would come here and randomly threaten to kill people. - Wed Nov  4 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: With the village expecting an attack from Genjikaure soon, he's on a bit of a paranoid edge- still, that kind of thing.. - Wed Nov  4 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Wed Nov  4 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Are you okay? - Wed Nov  4 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: She is extremely friendly. - Wed Nov  4 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So wait. What precisely is going on in Kirigakure? - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: The Mizukage is dead, there is no leader, and Kiri is a shell of it's former self.... I am fine, but it isn't a home. So I have no home. - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I used to live there too-- - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...My god. - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Kirie. . . - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Was it Edge and his men again..? - Wed Nov  4 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll talk with one of my friends. She'll give us the scoop.. - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know who Edge is. - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: -- So wait. If he turned you away, why are you still here? - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: He gave me two days I said. - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. I wasn't listening. - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Two days is... basically turnin--... - Wed Nov  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . . - Wed Nov  4 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: No its not. - Wed Nov  4 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. . ? - Wed Nov  4 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Helllooo. . ? - Wed Nov  4 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I thought you were having trouble listening to me? - Wed Nov  4 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Females. - Wed Nov  4 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I just said I wasn't listening -- for that comment. Geez. - Wed Nov  4 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Is that a good joke? I feel like I did good. - Wed Nov  4 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh....guess not. - Wed Nov  4 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slowly, sighing as she pulls herself up to stand fully.

"Mrm. How about we take this discussion away to somewhere that isn't an Arena? And didn't yah hear her, Sanoke? She said she had fouty eight hours to stay here." She says with a sad smile, leaning back.

"Anyway.... I was serious when I said that... if you need a place to stay- I have a place back in Konoha. I can't really let you in there while I'm still here- but if you tell Takeda Hideyoshi that I sent you, he should look out for you for at least a little while- with your home gone, I am happy to make this kind of an offer." She says gently.

"It just seems like the right thing to do- still.. anything you could tell us about what happened to Kiri would definitly be apreciated.."* - Wed Nov  4 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Heh... good joke. - Wed Nov  4 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: I thought Sanoke wasn't listening to her. - Wed Nov  4 12:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods her head, smiling gently.

"I always prefer making more freinds, over making enemies- because having lots of freinds is a good thing, and having enemies a bad one.. Y'know?" She explains simply- shrugging off the compliments.

"Anyway... I definitly hope to meet you again sometime, too. You seem like a good person, if an unfortunate one.." She sighs, frowning sadly. "It's a shame that people like that seem to be the ones this world wishes misfortune upon.... what, with the destruction of your home. Anyway... I'd love to continue to speak with you- but for now, I.. need to go to sleep." She admits, rubbing her head awkwardly.

"I'm.. very tired- I spent most of today training or sparring, and it's pretty late!"* - Wed Nov  4 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) bows her head slightly- as she tends to do to most people.

"Good night, Sanoke-San, Goodnight Chikya-San, goodnight Ume-San. I'll be around! See you tommorow... and seriously- Ume. If you're ever in Konoha again, just tell Takeda that you're a freind of mine, and he should help you out!" She says with a gentle smile- before forming a tiger seal and flickering away.* - Wed Nov  4 12:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Alright. - Wed Nov  4 12:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stretches out- as she hops down into the training arena as part of her morning routine- then pauses as she notices that someone else is there.

"Hrm? Oh, Wanderer-San. Hello, what brings you out here?" She inquires cheerily- as she reaches for her Katana; drawing the iron blade smoothly as she starts to put herself through her Kata; striking at the air and working on her footwork besides.* - Wed Nov  4 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, and you're here too, Jiki. Nice to meet you. - Wed Nov  4 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles back at him serenely as she steps forwards and sweeps the blade horizontal, before sidestepping to the left to bring the blade around horizontally in a half-spin like manuvear.

"Not much; just engaging in a part of my morning training routine to wake myself up!" She says in a cheerful, warm voice as the blade whistles through the air; iron pushing through the air.* - Wed Nov  4 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) continues to flow through the her forms, smiling gently as Jiki speaks.

"I see.... Well, have a good day then, yeah?" She says warmly to him as he walks away, and she continues to train.* - Wed Nov  4 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) eventually, walks out to the field; wiping sweat from her brow with a low sigh as she stretches out.

"Mrm... well, that was nice.."* - Wed Nov  4 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Morning people. - Wed Nov  4 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hello.. - Wed Nov  4 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles serenely and waves at Lera as she's greeted.

"Greetings."* - Wed Nov  4 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Greetings - Wed Nov  4 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Names Ketsuki- it's nice to meetcha, miss, sir. - Wed Nov  4 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) speaks- nodding at Lera then Shin.* - Wed Nov  4 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lera. Plesure. - Wed Nov  4 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I am called Shin. - Wed Nov  4 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles and nods.

"And a pleasure to make your aquiantance, as well. I'm just a visitor here- do you live here, yourself?" she inquires with a gentle tone; easy, gentle eyes looking over the two people she is greeting- as she notices Marissa approach.

"Oh, and good morning to you, as well, Marissa-kun."* - Wed Nov  4 20:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Hi . . .  - Wed Nov  4 20:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...I would love to talk, but theres something I have to do. - Wed Nov  4 20:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Wed Nov  4 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, very well... - Wed Nov  4 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Is something wrong, Lera? - Wed Nov  4 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hey Marrisa. We had someone bomb the village but they have been captured and jailed. - Wed Nov  4 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: . . Who was it? - Wed Nov  4 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: A kid named Leo..said he did it because I said I was bored. - Wed Nov  4 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Obviously he's mentally ill. - Wed Nov  4 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..Yeah, sounds like a lunatic. - Wed Nov  4 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) waves cheerily at Yan, smiling gently.

"Names Ketsuki, nice to meetcha Yan!"* - Wed Nov  4 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Nice to meet you as well. - Wed Nov  4 20:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Wed Nov  4 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He- - Wed Nov  4 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Well a'right then. - Wed Nov  4 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles and turns to wave at Ume.

"Ah, Wanderer-San. Hello!" She says warmly upon recognizing the palefaced girl.* - Wed Nov  4 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks at that, tilting her head to the side.

"Knows what, Miss?"* - Wed Nov  4 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm looking for plants, something different than all these little cacti. - Wed Nov  4 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, I see.. - Wed Nov  4 21:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh, okay. Do you think anyone else knows? - Wed Nov  4 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm.. I don't really know any Herbalists... - Wed Nov  4 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sorry. I know there where a few herbal plants around some of the Konoha gardens.. - Wed Nov  4 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But I remember you saying you'd aready been there. - Wed Nov  4 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh... no...why do people keep thinking I mean herbs. - Wed Nov  4 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I meant like... flowers. - Wed Nov  4 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Oh! - Wed Nov  4 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Or strange plants. - Wed Nov  4 21:07:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Did I just sound superficial? - Wed Nov  4 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....Well, there was that waterfall a while south of Konoha- that was kinda pretty... but it's not a flower.. - Wed Nov  4 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: O-oh, I meant here.... I've already been to Konoha. I saw most of what was to see there. - Wed Nov  4 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) taps her chin, seeming to scrunch her brow up in serious thought.

"Hrm... and there where those massive trees mixed in with the orange ones, but you've seen Konoha.." She murmurs, tilting her head back as she taps her foot.

"Hrmmm.. Hrmm!" She thinks. "Well, the most beautiful flowers here are all people- and I don't know of any actual local plants, I'm sorry."* - Wed Nov  4 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) whispers: My name is Ume by the way,  I forgot to tell you. - Wed Nov  4 21:09:45 2015
