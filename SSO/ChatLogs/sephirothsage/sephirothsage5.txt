<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Just to help others. - Sat Oct 24 21:50:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I like the idea of the Hokage fight. - Sat Oct 24 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: What idea? - Sat Oct 24 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh, I suggested a tournament while the festival is going on. - Sat Oct 24 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: With either a five thousand or ten thousand entry fee. - Sat Oct 24 22:03:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: People like to fight strong people, a fight with the Hokage is a nice incentive. - Sat Oct 24 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Or if they don't want that, I guess we can also give the half a million prize. - Sat Oct 24 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Mmm..Need a cigar. - Sat Oct 24 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I can provide that if the village can't... - Sat Oct 24 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I can provide. - Sat Oct 24 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Ok then. - Sat Oct 24 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: We could also set up some fun little competitions like strength and speed competitions. - Sat Oct 24 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Stuff that people can try and prove themselves against others with, people like that. - Sat Oct 24 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Mhmm. - Sat Oct 24 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Good. - Sat Oct 24 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: The sudden silence...Rather strong isn't it? - Sat Oct 24 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh... - Sat Oct 24 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So how is being a paper manipulator? - Sat Oct 24 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Helpful. - Sat Oct 24 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I remember the one from here was...kinda weak. - Sat Oct 24 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Weak how? - Sat Oct 24 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Well...She was made of paper so... - Sat Oct 24 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Pretty much everything could hurt her... - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Wait, made of paper? That seems... very odd. - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Fire...water...wind...earth... - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I've heard. - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I guess with a style like that she'd be very reliant on dodging. - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Avoidance. - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Long Range assault. - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: I haven't seen her since Suitengu died...guess she died with him. - Sat Oct 24 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: She should have invested into defense. - Sat Oct 24 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Paper...defense..? - Sat Oct 24 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Indeed. - Sat Oct 24 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I mean, I don't really see how that works. - Sat Oct 24 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: If you know what you're doing, paper can he as hard as earth, sharp as wind and whatnot. - Sat Oct 24 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh...and as flammable as fuel... - Sat Oct 24 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: All depends if that fire user wants to take the chance. - Sat Oct 24 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I would. - Sat Oct 24 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Well, against me, it won't work unless you're better than I am when it comes to chakra control. - Sat Oct 24 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'd still take the chance. - Sat Oct 24 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm pretty confident in my own abilites. - Sat Oct 24 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'm only assuming the one here focus on only offensive techniques. - Sat Oct 24 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Meh, Any technique can be offensive if you use it correctly. - Sat Oct 24 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hehe, well said. - Sat Oct 24 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Well, I should get going back to the mansion. - Sat Oct 24 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: See you all later. - Sat Oct 24 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Bye mum. - Sat Oct 24 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Later. - Sat Oct 24 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hey Zeus. - Sat Oct 24 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... - Sat Oct 24 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Made of paper uh..Hmmm, sounds stupid from a front view but...From inside of the idea...She could be quite powerful..Just don't know how to use her own power I'm guessing. - Sat Oct 24 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I should probably go get to training. I'm a little off, after all... Mrm. - Sat Oct 24 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hey Ketsuki. - Sat Oct 24 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Come around the Mansion more, Me and Hana are always there. - Sat Oct 24 22:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Yeah, sure. - Sat Oct 24 22:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Mm..I think I might look around the village a little since I'll be there for a day. - Sat Oct 24 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Actually- I don't supose either of you would care for a sparring match, for training purposes? - Sat Oct 24 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Eh.. - Sat Oct 24 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Maybe kiddo. - Sat Oct 24 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Kiddo? We look about the same age, y'know - Sat Oct 24 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: True, just a bad habit. - Sat Oct 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Mind if I watch..? - Sat Oct 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well.. - Sat Oct 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Regardless. - Sat Oct 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'll be out in the training field, if anyone cares to join me!~ - Sat Oct 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Oh, you both came? Well, a'right then. - Sat Oct 24 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Well, I wanna see what Miss Ketsuki can do. - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Don't expect my all though. - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'll just be over here...I don't really allow myself to spar... - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. that's good- cus I'm not really that good, y'know? - Sat Oct 24 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Forget to eat...DAMMIT! - Sat Oct 24 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles gently at that, bowing respectfully to her opponent.

"I'm just a low rank Genin, really." She says- forming handseals as she rises from the bow- eyes looking towards her foe as she takes a step to the side- and a cutain of black leaves begins to fall around her foe as she slinks to the side with a grin.

"Not at all good at much of anything. Still- I'm working on it. Let's go, yeah?" She says cheerily, reaching for a Tanto as the Genjutsu is launched.* - Sat Oct 24 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) goes quiet as the Genjutsu settles in, blade at the ready as she darts forwards. She's drawing her Tanto free as she lunges forwards, faintly smiling.

"I'm a practioner of two things. Genjutsu, and Kenjutsu. I'm a lot better one than I am the other- care to guess which?" She asks as she darts in with a grin. In a real fight, speaking out about what you're doing would be unwise; but this is a spar, and she doesn't want to risk lasting damage...

Even as she darts to her foes side, slashing at her arm from the side with a suprisingly smooth stroke.

She's trying to find a hole in the paper, unsure if she really can manage to pierce it in a meaningful way- it's a testing, probing slash as she steps past, still on the balls of her feet and wary.

"Still, this paper stuff... not half bad, huh?"* - Sat Oct 24 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) skids back after making brief contact with her blade against the paper; and her eyes widen. The blow impacts; but it does nothing. She steps back briefly, eyes scanning the paper.

"Woo.. not bad..." She trails of, grunting as she shifts her grip to a two handed one on the blade... but then she hears something.

She hears the other girl crying, and frowns as she steps back; releasing the Genjutsu.

"Hey.. uhm... are you okay? It was just a Genjutsu- just something meant to show you your fears.. not.. traumatize you." She says- frowning as she makes another sweep at the paper with her Tanto blade, trying to find spaces between the layers to get in deeper before hitting the wall of paper.* - Sat Oct 24 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) steps back, frowning as she holds her Katana steady, frowning sadly. She bows her head in apology, seeming obviously ashamed of herself for putting the other woman thruogh this, as she clasps her hands together in apology, blade held downwards.

"...My sincere apologies. I.... didn't expect that kind of a result, not at all. If you'd like a while to rest, or to stop this entirely, I completely understand. Gomen Nassai." She says softly, bowing her head as she steps back and looks at the woman.

"It was not my intent to cause.. that kind of pain."* - Sat Oct 24 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slightly. As the girl gives her consent for the spar to continue, the black haired and black eyed girl crouches briefly- before making another lunge in the moment that the papers return to their standby state; seeing if she can land a blow before they swirl back into a guarding formation as she steps forwards and sweeps with her blade, laughing happily.* - Sat Oct 24 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: A'right then! - Sat Oct 24 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Let's have fun, then, so you don't have to think about that stuff! - Sat Oct 24 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slightly, crouching next to the girl as she sheathes her Tanto smoothly, and smiles gently.

"Hrm... Well, we could go get ice cream... we could just.. run around or something.... I mean. What do you do for fun, huh? We'll do that, whatever it is, yeah?" She says cheerfully, beaming happily at the other girl to try and cheer her up, radiating good cheer and energy.* - Sat Oct 24 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm... - Sun Oct 25 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) strokes her chin, frowning as she stares at Ai, thinking quietly.

"Hrm.. You don't have any hobbies..? Nothin at all..?" She says, frowning worriedly as she looks towards the woman... before sighing and tilting her head back.

"I see... Hrm... Well, uh.." She trails of. "... Can't really prank the Hokage, his office is... exploded and in reconstruction like the rest of the mansion... Hrm.." She trails of, thinking. "....Uh... hrm.." She frowns. "...Sorry, I've got nothing."* - Sun Oct 25 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Wanna get something to eat? - Sun Oct 25 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sure.  - Sun Oct 25 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Order anything. - Sun Oct 25 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. - Sun Oct 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So, meal's on me- I'll pay. - Sun Oct 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Whadaya want? - Sun Oct 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: No, no. - Sun Oct 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'll pay. - Sun Oct 25 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? I insist. I always pay for food if I'm around for a meal! - Sun Oct 25 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: 's What I do! - Sun Oct 25 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Today you won't. - Sun Oct 25 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ehhh? Come on! Are you reallyy going to insist that you not accept someone else paying for a meal, huh? - Sun Oct 25 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) frowns slightly, then sighs and leans into her seat.

"Fine, I s'pose. If you're really adamant about this. Is this a boy thing? Not going to let me pay on principle, or something? I mean.. I still feel bad about earlier, and.." She trails of and sighs. "...Anyway, if you wanna pay, you can pay."* - Sun Oct 25 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs at that, crossing her arms stubbornly under her breasts as she harumphs... before a wry smile spreads across her lips.

"Asked me out, huh..?~ Does that make this a date, or somethin, Ai-san?" She teases lightly, lifting her eyebrows up with a playful grin- continuing to try and keep the other womans mind off of whatever trauma she brought up earlier.* - Sun Oct 25 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grins at that, a gleam in her eyes almost mischievous in nature as she leans to the side- speaking in a soft, pleasant tone.

"Well in that case, please take good care of me, okay?~" She says happily, biting a lip and grinning- before turning to the menu board and smiling. She thinks for a moment- before ordering.

"Hrm... Spicy Miso Soup with ramen n' meat, I think."* - Sun Oct 25 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grins as the other person leans in closer, and relaxes fully as she nods, and sighs contentedly.

"Fragile, huh..? Then I'll do my best to be gentle, and take perfect care of you, how does that sound, Hrmm..?~" She responds with a grin, looking at the girl with bright, cheerful eyes as she does.

"Mrm... this is going to be good." She murmurs as the other person orders, licking her lips hungrily, grinning as she shrugs of her bulky cloak to show the much lighter leather outfit she's wearing beneath it.

"Mrm... So! You've taken me out on a date. Now what, huh?"* - Sun Oct 25 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles gently at that, smiling happily. She sighs gently, as she unbuckles her own Tanto to lay it on the side of the table- as the smells of cooking broth and meat waft out through the building, bringing a happy smile to the womans face as she breathes in, and sighs.

"Hrm? Well, sure! I mean, I'm not that interesting- but I'll tell you whatever! Well, m'names Ketsuki, and...well, I was born and raised here in Konoha, but I only went into the Academy when I was sixteen, much later than usual; I wanted to wait. I spent most of my time before then reading, and spending time with my family, mhrm! I graduated a little while ago, and well.. I've been a genin ever since." She concludes cheerily, beaming happily.

"Any questions about me, hrm..?~"* - Sun Oct 25 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles at that, stroking her chin.

"You need to remember them, huh..? Planning on becoming my boyfreind after just one date, huh?" She teases lightly, giggling happily before sighing and leaning back. "Still, I'll happily tell you! My favorite color is violet, my favorite food is... really, anything spicy, and I think swords are really cool and useful, Mhrm! It's why I've been training to get good with one, actually... Yeah, Kenjutsu is probably my favorite form of combat, even though I'm far more naturally talented in Genjutsu." She explains chipperly- grinning as the smells of food continue to waft towards them.

"Mrm.... and my favorite hobbies are.... painting, reading poems, and hand to hand combat training... it's just so fun to work out like that!~" She says happily, chuckling softly as he looks towards Ai and sighs happily, leaning towards the table.

"Also..? This is really nice. I feel bad- I was trying to cheer you up, and I feel like I'm the one having the more fun!"* - Sun Oct 25 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grins at the coy response- then leans towards Ai, sliding an arm around the other girls waist gently.

"I don't think I'd mind having a boyfreind like you..." She says softly, blushing slightly at the admission- before looking towards the food that just arrived. "And.... I'm glad to hear you're having fun too, yeah?" She says serenely, smiling like a cat almost as she looks on at the food before her as it arrives- breathing in the aroma happily, as she reaches one handed with her free hand to grab chopsticks- and begins to lift chunks of meat and noodles into her mouth, humming.* - Sun Oct 25 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles and nods. Meanwhile- she simply took Ai's word as a declaration of how she prefered to be refered to. If Ai wants to be treated like a guy- she'll treat them like a guy, simply on account of having been asked to do so.

She sighs gently, after a few bites- then blushes feverishly as she's called cute... before preening almost at the compliment, lifting her nose in a dignified fashion.

"O-of course I am! I'm the cutest Shinobi in Konoha, got it?~" She squeeks awkwardly, blushing proudly as she slurps up yet more noodles, and continues to lean into the other figure, smiling happily.* - Sun Oct 25 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blushes even brighter- her face going ruby red as her cheek is stroked, then wiped clean- and then the words that follow only make the blush brighter.

"A-and don't you forget it, okay..?" She says softly- before turning to finish her food.. digging in hungrily, showing a suprising and impressive appetite as mouthful after mouthful of meat and noodles finds it's way down her lips- even as her other hand squeezes on Ai's waist happily, holding her close happily.

She herself is simply.. warm and soft, but providing a strong support from the side; she's strong, as she holds the other person close.

After a while of eating, she seems to have calmed noticeably, and smiles gently. "....I'm glad you've cheered up. It makes me happy, to see someone else happy like this- and I'm really glad I met you, because... this has been really, really nice."* - Sun Oct 25 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles softly- feeling.. oddly safe around this person from another village, for some reason. She sighs happily at the feeling of someone leaning against her shoulder, and hums gently as she looks at what's left of the food.

"Mrm... so. Share the bowl of ice cream, hrm?~" She suggests gently, reaching for the bowl with her free hand to grab a spoon- scooping up a spoonful of ice-cream to lift towards Ai's mouth, blushing slightly as she makes the gesture. She sighs happily, at the head on her shoulder- holding the other girl close and feeling..

Safe, comfortable, and content for once.* - Sun Oct 25 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) hums softly at that- blushing gently at the look on the girls face, and the tone of her boyfreinds voice. She's not sure if the other person is biologically a boy or not; and doesn't really care one way or the other, if she's honest. So with a gentle smile, she pulls the spoon free of Ai's lips to take another scoop of ice cream for herself, and as she licks the spoon clean and pulls it free... she grins mischievously, amused by that embarassed expression as she reaches for anotehr spoonful for Ai.

"Mhrm. Didn't I just say?~ This is the most... content and warm and happy I've felt in a while." She says with absolute sincerity,as she lifts another spoonful of icecream towards Ai.* - Sun Oct 25 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks at that- then smiles as she takes the ice cream out. She's enjoying the moment without much thought for the future- but then, that's how she usually operates; living in the moment without a concern for the future.

She blinks as the woman with her lays down, blinking as she looks to the note- reading it quickly as she speaks aloud.

"Hey, are you... okay? Something up? Bad news?" She inquires, as her eyes scan the letter, and she sits as comfortably as she can with a head in her lap.* - Sun Oct 25 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles gently at that, thinking quietly as she keeps an arm around her new boyfreinds waist, holding close and warmly.

"I see.. Mrm. I'd consider coming, but... there's no way I'm ready for a Chuunin exam yet, and... I need to keep working on missions. Maybe we can visit each other from time to time when we're each not busy, yeah? Keep in contact with letters or something otherwise." She suggests- a cheerful smile on her lips as she takes another bite of ice cream.

"Now... you gonna sit up so you can keep having more ice cream, or just be adorable and cuddle down there?"* - Sun Oct 25 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at that- and speaks softly, but assuredly; after getting through the blush at the first sentance, as she simply holds them close and sighs.

"Mrm. I'm glad you do, mhrm... Hrm?" She chuckles at that- then shakes her head and smiles. "Sorry... but I can't really promise something like that. I can't promise to avoid danger, not at all. I can promise I'll survive. That I'll be strong enough to make it out- but avoiding danger? I'm a Shinobi, same as you are; my life is danger. I won't start turning down missions just because I'm dating a cute guy, y'know." She says playfully.

"And I won't let this village fall, either."* - Sun Oct 25 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly- blushing at the gentle touch of someone she barely knows- but who she already trusts, for some reason. A thought at the back of her head idly and sarcastically points out that she's being a poor Shinobi acting like this- but the rest of her doesn't much care. She chuckles softly at that- and speaks calmly.

"If I need your help, I won't hesitate to call- don't worry. And don't worry about me, either. I'm not the strongest, sure- but I know what I'm doing, and I'm a tough one, y'know." She says with a playful smile.* - Sun Oct 25 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles as Ai shifts upwards to sit upright. She looks at the message, and chuckles softly as she takes a perhaps inadvised swig of Sake from one of the small cups, before lowering the cup, swaying slightly and giggling.

"Mrm... that's nice..." She says chipperly, cheeks flushing red from that single drink of Sake- it seems she has a poor tolerance.* - Sun Oct 25 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) giggles softly, turning to look at Ai with a broad g rin.

"Hrm..? Mrm... it kinda burns, but it's kinda tasty....Mmmhrm. But don't worry!~ I won't have much more at all, I'll just finish the one glass, okayyyy?" She says mischievously, biting a lip as she reaches for another scoop of icecream to feed Ai.

"Mrmkay?"* - Sun Oct 25 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) squeeks at that- blushing at the offer of rest, her strange mind going strange places as she let's go of the second cup of Sake, in favor of cuddling back, sliding both arms around the other womans form as she is hugged.

She sighs happily, nuzzling drunkenly into her shoulder.

"Hrm..? Mrm.... I didn't do anything you owe me for, cus it made me happy and stuff too, okay..?" She says in a slight slur. "I'll be.. I'll be sure.. to be a good girlfreind, too... mhrm!" She says brightly, holding her closely with a smile.

"Mrm.. .and I like the way you look, y'know. Bishounen is good.. mhrm, mhrm.." She murmurs, smiling happily in the cuddle. "As for home.. uhm... oh dear.."* - Sun Oct 25 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) snuggles closer, humming gently, and pouting at the mention of home.

"Mhrm... I live in the academy, ever since.." She shudders and closes her eyes. "For reasons." She says simply, snuggling into the other persons shoulder as she just leans into her, arms around her embracing gently. She sighs happily at that, and just giggles faintly.

"Mrm... not so bad, tho... nuh uh, not at all.."* - Sun Oct 25 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks at that- then shrugs as she shifts closer.

"Dunnow, never bothered thinking about it. It's not like I don't have money, I just don't think about things like that. I drift around, I s'pose." She explains with a yawn and a faint smile. "Ever since.. "She shrugs again, not going into what happened.

"I like it. Not being.. tied down to a place. Y'know..? That is.. I don't know how much for a house."* - Sun Oct 25 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks at this, tilting her head sideways.

"Huh..? Y'sure..?" She murmurs as she gets clingy. "I mean...is this really the time? I feel kinda fuzzy.. n' stuff.." She murmurs, yawning as she clings closer a bit- then smiles gently. "But I mean.. I guess if you wanna.."* - Sun Oct 25 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) yawns and chuckles at that.

"Sure, I guess.. if we can find the Hokage." She says, as she snuggles closer- arms wrapped tight around Ai at this point, and head burried fully in her shoulder. Her legs are creeping up to latch on as well, and at this rate it won't be long before she's clinging fully.* - Sun Oct 25 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly, blushing as she is lifted up- and then clings tight, wrapped around the other girl.

"Mhrm! Tight 's I can!" She says with a faint smile, clinging gently.* - Sun Oct 25 05:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: History for me. - Sun Oct 25 06:10:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: .... I wonder why.. - Sun Oct 25 06:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm..? - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Wanted..? - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Nani? - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: The eyes. - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah... sorry, I thought you meant criminally. - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Nah. - Sun Oct 25 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I wanna tell ya something but I don't want ya to freak out or be afraid of me. - Sun Oct 25 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Of course. You can trust me. - Sun Oct 25 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: I'm from this clan but..The outer shell, my clan symbol is on the back of my suit, close to the neck. - Sun Oct 25 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slowly, as she gently slides free... then chuckles softly, smiling faintly.

"..I see. Personally, I don't wear any such symbol, but.." She chuckles softly. "Man, this is ironic.." She tilts her head to look up at the sky- then down at the nearby lake. "Seems we share a clan." She muses as she looks out over the water, hands in her pockets as she now is standing next to Ai, rather than clinging to them.* - Sun Oct 25 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) meanwhile, grew up in Konoha- and lacks the pride to openly wear the symbol in any shape or form. She chuckles softly- without bothering to really think about 'is this incest then', a worrying issue.

"Mrm... doesn't mean much to me, either." She admits softly- smiling gently as she turns to look out over the lake next to Ai, hands in ehr pockets and a smile on her face.

"Being happy, and doing what I know is right.. that's what matters to me- and you're making me happy, right now. Mhrm.."* - Sun Oct 25 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at that- hugging back and squeezing gently.

"Hrm..? Why would you have thought that- there's no way you knew we where related when you said it after all, right?" She says- before shrugging and chuckling. "Not that I much care either way, but.." She shrugs and smiles.

"I guess it's no big deal, huh?~ Well.... Mrm... You feel nice.." She murmurs, squeezing gently as she hugs back, and holding her close as she leans into her.* - Sun Oct 25 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nuzzles her chin in closer and smiles softly, a hand sliding down from being around the waist to gently hold at Ai's hips- the other sliding up to squeeze around her shoulders as she nuzzles into her- pressing her body closer in response to being pulled in.

"Mhrm..~ All soft 'n warm...~ It's good, it feels... warm and happy.~" She says softly, sighing happily as she holds her close.* - Sun Oct 25 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) snuggles closer, closing her own eyes and squeezing the other person next to her close, humming softly. She's a little tipsy, and a littly ditzy- one of which is a first time for her, and the other of which is the norm.

"Mhrm.. yah huh..." She responds with a light giggle, swaying back and forth in the others arms happily, humming softly.

"...Mrm.." And it seems, growing sleepier by the moment.* - Sun Oct 25 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) bites her lip- then grins mischievously, her face unnervingly catlike once more- just like before their food arrived in the resturant, in fact; as she grins and clings to the other person holding her.. speaking softly.

"How about just one bed, hrm..?~"* - Sun Oct 25 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: As you wish.~ - Sun Oct 25 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods, smiling from where she's held in that bridal carry, a mischievous glint in her eyes.

"I believe so too, mhrm..~ C'mon then, Ai-kun. Let's get to bed, shall we..?"* - Sun Oct 25 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she's set on the bed. She looks around- and sets a large pouch against the wall.. and then begins to produce a suprising number of Shuriken and Senbon hidden in her coat to slide into the bag, before adding a Kunai, a Tanto, an explosive tag, another Kunai, and finally, a few assorted scrolls to the pile. She yawns as she lays against the bed, and chuckles.

"I'm fine on clothes, y'know... Jutsu could be interesting to learn, though... Mhrm... but for now... how about you curl up here in bed with me, and we get some rest, yeah?~ Unless... you had ideas about this bed other than rest?~" She teases jokingly- a playful light in her eyes as she pulls up the covers and starts to slide under- after sliding of her leather coat to reveal that under /that/, she has yet more clothes; these howver, very scant; a pair of shorts and a tight T-shirt making up her garb underneath that heavy coat.

"Mrm..?~"* - Sun Oct 25 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grins playfully at that- simply looking at the other woman as she undresses and smilin warmly. She lounges back in the bed as the other woman crawls in- and slides an arm around her lovers hips to pull her closer- leaning in to press her lips against the other womans ear, almost; whispering quietly, lips so close that they are almost brushing against her earlobe as her breath brushes against her.

"Well.. how about a bedtime kiss, as we snuggle to get nice and comfortable?~" She suggests with a playful grin, her legs brushing against Ai's own as she holds her close against her in the bed underneath the covers.* - Sun Oct 25 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles softly at that. She feels herself being wrapped close- and likes it. She sees the other womans face comes close- and as she closes her eyes, she reaches with a hand for the back of the other womans face..

And brings her own lips up to meet hers, pulling her closer as she pushes her warm, soft, inviting lips against Ai's own happily. Her eyes close, and she simply moulds her body against Ai's as she embraces her lips with her own- tentative, shy at first; unsure what she's doing as her lips simply brush against hers, and wait for the other to take the lead, uncertain on what to do next.. but hungry.* - Sun Oct 25 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) gasps out softly- doing her best to follow the other womans lead. She's slightly clumsy; as if she's never kissed before.. but at the same time, she's someone with a certain level of control over her body; as she seems to learn quickly.

As her lips brush in turn, moving her own bottom lip up to rest between her lovers lips, shifting that slight motion before brushing back down to shift lips in time with her partners motions- a hungry heat seeming to radiate from the woman clinging to Ai so close- as her legs curl around to twine with the other womans own, and her arms hold her close- one lovingly stroking, running through her hair- and the other holding her close by the hips as her chest rubs against her partners own in the closeness of the moment.

Her lips, pressing closer even as they brush up and down.* - Sun Oct 25 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) gasps softly at the bite- enjoying the moment, but... soon enough, after a few moments more of following along, she breaks the contact, having been slowing down gradually after a few moments.

"Mrm... best.. first kiss.. ever." She whispers softly... before closing her eyes, and finally, fully, passing out to sleep.* - Sun Oct 25 08:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) yawns from within the bed, shifting as she stirs much like a cat stirring from it's sleep- eyes slowly opening as she groggily looks about.

"Hrn... Mrm..?"* - Mon Oct 26 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stirs happily, as she stretches out and slides out of bed, nodding gently, a serene smile on her face.

"Mhrm... Yeah, I did... Mrm, is that breakfast..?" She murmurs as she looks towards the food, smiling serenely.* - Mon Oct 26 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles at that as she yawns, pulling herself upright fully and rubbing her eyes- before speaking softly.

"Only when I want absolutely sure to never let go of what I'm holding.~" She says gently- as she pulls a bowl of ramen into her lap, and begins to eat quickly and rapidly, humming happily.* - Mon Oct 26 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles softly at the kiss to her cheek, blushing gently before sighing and leaning back.

"Mrm... what kind of Jutsu are they, anyway? Cus, uh.. my chakra control isn't really that great, y'know." She warns with a slight smile as she finishes her bowl of ramen and sets it aside.* - Mon Oct 26 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles at that- and nods slightly.

"Ah... really, I've been working on my control for a while, if I'm honest. Another freind of mine actually has.. also meant to teach me Great Fire Ball. So... maybe- let's focus on Shunshin, yeah?" She says with a gentle smile.

"High speed movement seems really useful.... and like the less chakra intensive of the two- though.. likely draining physically? I've a pretty good physique.."* - Mon Oct 26 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) chuckles softly at that- then nods slightly. She listens intently for a long while- before frowning severely at the end of that.

"I.. see. It seems I have work to do, then.... Something is wrong.. Takeda wouldn't do something like that- in fact, he wouldn't be covered in blood if he'd killed people, he's a pure elementalist. It almost had to be a henge... we should report this elsewhere."* - Mon Oct 26 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slightly, smiling at the nuzzling, briefly brushing back- before shifting to reach for her coat, and then her cloak; suiting up and gathering her things before nodding and heading to the door.

"Right. Now, let's go. Lead the way to where you saw him."* - Mon Oct 26 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm..? - Mon Oct 26 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Takeda... - Mon Oct 26 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You alright? - Mon Oct 26 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares at Takeda with a severe expression, arms crossed underneath her cloak as she stares at him.

"Takeda. We are comrades, unless you're someone wearing his face; likely, considering I know Takeda to be a pure elementalist. If you killed people, you wouldn't be covered in blood. What's wrong, Takeda? What happened here..? And I swear by Konoha- if you are some faker wearing his skin..? I will end you." She states firmly- eyes agleam with a mix of concern, suspicion.. and rage.* - Mon Oct 26 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares at Takeda and frowns. She crosses her arms, and sighs- bowing her head and shaking it.

"You're wrong, Takeda. We're comrades in arms, whether you like it or not. Thus, it is my responsibility and duty... to make sure you're okay. To help you. It's clear something is wrong... that something has hurt you. And you can trust me- because I swear to you, on all that I hold sacred- on this village, on my freinds, on my clan. I will help you, however I can- so please... don't do this." She says softly- taking a single step forwards- hands held out wide to either side, a sad frown on her face.* - Mon Oct 26 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares at the man across from her... and closes her eyes, sighing sadly as she tilts her head back, taking a deep breath as she crosses her arms and closes her eyes- the news rattling her

"...I.. I see.." She says softly- a deep sadness settling in on her. Hana? Her Senpai, her Sensei..? Her first freind amongst her fellow Shinobi, her dearest freind? Dead? Gone? Dust in the wind..? She shakes for a moment, taking a deep breath before opening her eyes.

".....Nothing I can say will make that pain go away. Nothing I can say, will make it hurt less.... but... I understand. I lost my parents a few years ago as well... I know how it feels to see that... and I am so, so sorry you have had to.... gods, but..... I.." She trails of, clenching her fists- as she takes another step forwards, before crouching near Takeda- onyx eyes fixed on him.

"....But I will be here for you. I will comfort you as best I can... because I know that the worst thing you can do for that pain, is leave yourself alone, lash out, and let it fill you. You can't do that- Hana wouldn't want that, wouldn't want her son to live his life in misery because of what happened to her. She'd want you to stand strong, get strong- and avenge her. Not leave yourself alone and in suffering. Come on- let me help you, Takeda."* - Mon Oct 26 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) holds up her hands- no hands on a weapon. She ceases in advancing- but locks eyes with him as she rises slowly to stand fully.

"...So you hurt. So you've lost people. So the answer is to... kill everyone, so you don't have to lose anything again..? That's wrong. That'll only hurt you more- and make other people hurt, too. Do you really think that's what's right..? That it'll make you feel any better..? That kind of thing would just leave you empty and dead inside- and I promise you. It's better to feel pain than nothing at all... better to hope, than to give up. Come on- you just have to trust me, Takeda."* - Mon Oct 26 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Sad enough..He's taking another path.. - Mon Oct 26 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) begins to move her hands, hidden underneath her cloak, as she stares at him- speaking softly.

"This isn't the answer. Killing will only cause more suffering, more pain- leave you hurting worse, and worse, and worse. It's an endless cycle that you could never escape- a road that once you walk down, will never end. Please- just listen to me." She says softly- as her handseals finish; and as the trigger in this case, displaced leaves seem to fall from the rafters above, mixed in with dust and sand; none of it real, but acting as a curtain for a Genjutsu meant to subdue him.

Takeda has gone insane, she realizes; and she further realizes that nothing she is saying is entering his ears, not really.

And his stated goals, she cannot permit; and with this in mind, she enacts the Genjutsu, with intent to finish him while he's distracted; giving no sign that she performed handseals other than a shuffling of her bulky cloak, and the rain of feathers as she stares into his eyes.

"Please- I beg of you. Don't go down this bloody road."* - Mon Oct 26 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) lunges forwards as soon as the Jutsu takes effect. What she does, however- is perhaps unexpected.

"Ai, help me bind him- quickly!" She booms. She knows he'll struggle, that this will hurt him. She knows that he thinks it real, most likely; and she is terrified of what will happen if he's given time to struggle. She doesn't know if he'll force her hand- not yet...

But she has to be prepared. She doesn't yet draw her weapon- she simply throws herself at him in a sudden explosion of movement; placing an explosive Tag, yet to be detonated, on his chest; just in case he struggles and forces her hand... even as her other hand goes to grab his left wrist, and hold it as far away from his right as possible to prevent handseals; as she then shifts to...

Hug him, releasing the Jutsu as he finds himself in a warm, caring embrace... with his left hand pinned to his side, and Ketsuki's other arm holding him across the back in a caring embrace.

A bizzare strategy, perhaps; but she couldn't get close and neutralize the threat as he was; as the Jutsu fades, and she whispers in her ears.

"....You move on. It hurts, god, I know it hurts... but this pain, this horror- it won't help anyone. You still have me, your freind. If there is nothing for you here- move on. Don't stay... but don't let madness embrace you. Don't let murder and death become your life, because you've been hurt.... Shh.. It'll be okay, It has to be. I am here- and I will help you." She says softly.

She leaves no trace that it was a Genjutsu; not really, anyway. It fades before he could realize it was more than a hallucination, or so she hopes.. prays, even. She pins him to the ground with a caring hug- and pins his left arm to the side, preventing handseals.* - Mon Oct 26 04:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: That's depressing.... - Mon Oct 26 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) makes quiet, shhhing sounds; holding him gently. It's a warm, gentle embrace from a basically kind person as she hugs him tight, patting his back as she continues to hold his hand out of the way so he can't use Jutsu- as far as she knows, at least.

"....I understand. I lost my parents when I was young as well, and... I don't even live in a house anymore- I've never even thought about that since, I've just wanted to do what I thought would have made them proud.... and I understand- it leaves a hole in your heart you don't think you can ever fill- but please... just listen to me, Takeda." She says softly, patting his back gently as he cries into her shoulder.

"These feelings- they don't last forever. Things do get better- it is possible. You just have to keep trying. I know it hurts- god, it hurts to keep moving... but... nothing is truly impossible, you understand..?" She says softly- pain in her voice and in her eyes; a raw sympathy echoing from her as she holds the boy tight.* - Mon Oct 26 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) rubs his back gently, eyes closed and a sad frown on her face. She holds him close, keeping his hand pinned carefully; as she continues to speak in a soft, pained, compassionate voice.

"...You don't give up. You get stronger; strong enough to make sure no one can take them from you ever again. You don't stop caring; you find something you can care about. I understand- it hurts... to lose what you hold dear, to have it torn from you, piece by piece... but.." She closes her eyes and squeezes him close.

"If you give up, then the people who want to hurt you have won. If you stop caring, then whoever took them from you can rest in peace. If you stop having hope.... you've already forsaken any chance of being happy again.. so you can't do any of those things. I know...  I know it'll be hard. But.... would you really give those responsible the safety of you giving up..? Of falling into some... mad, useless frenzy..? No, you're stronger than that. Better than that... The Will of Fire, the spirit of Konoha- it burns in your breast, doesn't it..? Come on... you're better than this..."* - Mon Oct 26 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs gently- and smiles, leaning back as she lets him go.

"...Alright then." She says gently, as she leans back and smiles gently. A sigh escapes her lips as she smiles softly- leaning back as she stares him in the eyes. 

"Let's take this up with the Hokage next time we see him, and take his ass to task for this bullshit, yeah? Then... then we figure out what to do next- figure out who killed her... and make them wish they wheren ever born. How 'bout it?"* - Mon Oct 26 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: It starts with pain..Follow by hate..Fuel by the endless questions....No one can answer...*Sigh* I already know how this will go.. - Mon Oct 26 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....Right then. - Mon Oct 26 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'll stick 'round as long as you need, yeah? Is there anything else I can do to help...? - Mon Oct 26 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I...need you cloak... - Mon Oct 26 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods- smiling gently as she unclasps the cloak- then offers it to him.

"Of course. If you ever need someone to talk to, Takeda.. I'll be here."* - Mon Oct 26 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But one day, he'll go apeshit and kill literally everyone. - Mon Oct 26 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) leans against the wall.. and nods.

"...If you want, you don't have to burry her alone. She was my teacher, and a good freind, too.."* - Mon Oct 26 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: No...I need to do this alone...for Hana...for mum... - Mon Oct 26 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'll be back in a few minutes...it won't take long... - Mon Oct 26 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..Alright then. - Mon Oct 26 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slowly at Takeda, offering a gentle smile as she nods.

"...Yeah, I hope so too." She says softly, smiling sadly as sympathy gleams in her onyx eyes. "....Hopefully, she passes cleanly through the wheel of Samsara, and into a happier life."* - Mon Oct 26 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) closes her eyes, and gives the young man a comforting embrace- holding him steady and sighing gently.

"....I don't know, Takeda.. I just don't know.. I suppose that's something we'll need to fight to change, as we grow older, huh..? To be warriors of justice... and excise evil from this world. So that good people don't have to die anymore.. how does that sound?"* - Mon Oct 26 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: It sounds good...I just wish mum could have seen me grow up to do that... - Mon Oct 26 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Yeah. - Mon Oct 26 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Still.. it's something to strive for.. - Mon Oct 26 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: A reason for this poor bastard to live that /wont/ hurt others.. - Mon Oct 26 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't know who or what to protect anymore either...Mum was the only thing that kept me good. - Mon Oct 26 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I wanted to keep her safe because she pulled me out of darkness but now... - Mon Oct 26 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .... Hey. - Mon Oct 26 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Isn't the answer simple..? There are good things in this world still, even if none of them are yours anymore. There are good people, in this world still. - Mon Oct 26 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Is not stopping others from suffering something worth fighting for..? Is not the protection of what light can be found in this world worthwhile? - Mon Oct 26 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess i'll just have to find those people...and not lose myself again. - Mon Oct 26 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You don't know this but before I was with mum...I wasn't a good person. - Mon Oct 26 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I got into the wrong crowd of people and they changed me for the worse...I just hope that doesn't happen again. - Mon Oct 26 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... You just need to keep your eyes set on the horizon, and on yourself. - Mon Oct 26 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And make sure you don't lose who you are, or what it is you /really/ want. - Mon Oct 26 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Y'know? - Mon Oct 26 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's harder than it sounds, but.. - Mon Oct 26 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: It's worth it. - Mon Oct 26 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I hope so... - Mon Oct 26 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: After today...I don't think I ever want to see another person die... - Mon Oct 26 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Yeah. Death is.. - Mon Oct 26 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Something that's too sad, usually. - Mon Oct 26 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Still- sometimes it's required to take life to save life.. - Mon Oct 26 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I took a life in anger once... - Mon Oct 26 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I take it you regret that? - Mon Oct 26 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Everyday... - Mon Oct 26 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: She was a little older than me...recently graduated as a genin in kumo... - Mon Oct 26 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....Good. That means... you still have a heart, a good one, y'know..? - Mon Oct 26 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I helped caused her death and it felt good...real good. - Mon Oct 26 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... But you regreted it in the end, huh? - Mon Oct 26 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: But then I met Hana and all that changed...she showed me a different way. - Mon Oct 26 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'll never do that again...never. - Mon Oct 26 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I hope so. - Mon Oct 26 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .. Mrm. - Mon Oct 26 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I suppose I lack a home as well- personally, I just.. - Mon Oct 26 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sleep in the Academy Classrooms, mostly. - Mon Oct 26 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh. - Mon Oct 26 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I used to sleep on the street... - Mon Oct 26 06:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ....I'd help if I could, but... I don't even know where to start with such a thing as getting a house. - Mon Oct 26 06:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You're welcome to stay at my house...I won't be using it. - Mon Oct 26 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: No, it's fine. - Mon Oct 26 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I've never really... cared about that kind of thing. - Mon Oct 26 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You should...it changes things for it. - Mon Oct 26 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: for you* - Mon Oct 26 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. I just view the entire village as my home, y'know..? - Mon Oct 26 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah...me too. - Mon Oct 26 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Guess I should just wait for Shinjin now...I need to tell him as soon as possible. - Mon Oct 26 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ... Yeah. - Mon Oct 26 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: .... I think I'm headed to bed for now, myself. - Mon Oct 26 06:44:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah...see you tomorrow. - Mon Oct 26 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks away with a sad frown.* - Mon Oct 26 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) yawns as she walks towards the mansion, rubbing the back of her head as she looks around- before turning to wave at the man near the door.

"Hey, whats up? Don't think we've met- names Ketsuki... ah, I don't suppose you've seen the Hokage at all, today..? I've been lookin for him for a while now.."* - Mon Oct 26 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Hmmm? - Mon Oct 26 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) waves, smiling.

"Didjah hear me..?" The young Genin asks, blinking a few times.* - Mon Oct 26 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) shrugs at that- then nods and with a smile explains.

"I was wonderin if you've seen the Hokage 'round the village 'tall today, cus I've been looking for him to inform him about some stuff for a while now."* - Mon Oct 26 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Don't know who the Hokage is. - Mon Oct 26 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..Ah. - Mon Oct 26 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Can't help you there. - Mon Oct 26 22:33:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So, you're a Shinobi of the leaf as well..? - Mon Oct 26 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: If I wear, not knowing who the Hokage is would be sad. - Mon Oct 26 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah.. I figured it was understandable, considering how recent he is. - Mon Oct 26 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: If not, then... what exactly are you doing here? - Mon Oct 26 22:54:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Oh, I see. - Mon Oct 26 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: You didn't hear about what happened in Kumo? - Mon Oct 26 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: No, not yet. What happened? - Mon Oct 26 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: At first, we got attacked by some random person who was using their body parts as weapons. - Mon Oct 26 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Oh.. Oh dear.. - Mon Oct 26 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Then a army came right as we were fighting with the guy. - Mon Oct 26 23:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: So it was basicly a blood bath for us. - Mon Oct 26 23:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Only three people survived. - Mon Oct 26 23:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Including that ShitKage. - Mon Oct 26 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) gasps in horror, holding a hand over her mouth and frowning.

"...Oh Kami.... well, it's good you survived- but... that's so many deaths. How awful.."* - Mon Oct 26 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: It really wasn't that many deaths. Since more than half our village had left already. - Mon Oct 26 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: The person that attacked you with 'body parts'. Did he have pink-ish hair? - Mon Oct 26 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Nope. - Mon Oct 26 23:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: Why am I even talking to this guy..? Kumo has done no favors for me... - Mon Oct 26 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: What did she do here then? - Mon Oct 26 23:17:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: For that matter, do you know who attacked you? - Mon Oct 26 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: This girl was calling him Edge. - Mon Oct 26 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Edge, huh...? - Mon Oct 26 23:20:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ring any bells for you, Takeda-San? - Mon Oct 26 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Sorry, does what ring any bells? - Mon Oct 26 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That name, Edge. - Mon Oct 26 23:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks at the vocally said Meows, tilting her head as she turns to face Ai- and then smiling as she see's the other person, walking up and smiling as she turns towards her.

"Ah! Ai, heya!" She says cheerily, a broad smile flashing it's way onto the young girls face. "Good to see yah, how you been today?~"* - Mon Oct 26 23:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks in suprise- caught offuard by the sudden offer- and blushing lightly at the kiss on the forehead. She nods silently, sliding away the key, and the suprising amount of money that she also slides away; into her purse...

Before she steps forwards and embraces Ai- hugging her tight and smiling gently as she wraps her arms around her.

"... Thank you, Ai. I really am happy that I met you- and I'll do my best to stay in touch when you do leave. For now, though.. while you're here.. Let's spend a while together, yeah?'* - Mon Oct 26 23:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) squeezes Ai gently in the hug, smiling happily.

"I know, I know. I understood. We've both our duties to attend to, after all." She says warmly- before sighing and letting go, turning to face Baen. She crooks an eyebrow up- remembering the last time she met the man.

"And what brings you back 'round about these parts, hrm?"* - Tue Oct 27 00:00:51 2015

"...Ai is simply a very feminine looking guy." She says simply back to Baen, smiling as politely as she can.* - Tue Oct 27 00:11:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I see... - Tue Oct 27 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I should probably just do the world a favor and kill him. - Tue Oct 27 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Decisions, Decisions. - Tue Oct 27 00:22:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Takeda? - Tue Oct 27 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: It is you..Didn't recognise you. - Tue Oct 27 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slightly, smiling gently as she starts to walk by.

"Anyway... See you around, Baen. Have a.. pleasant day." She says softly- turning to look at Takeda and wince. "....You 'gon be okay, Takeda?" She says simply, as she starts to walk of- pausing for a moment to wait for a response.* - Tue Oct 27 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm fine Ketsuki, Just...fine. - Tue Oct 27 00:37:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ...Anyway. - Tue Oct 27 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hokage isn't around Baen, Haven't seen him in a long while. - Tue Oct 27 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Yeah, everyone's telling me that. - Tue Oct 27 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I had some questions to ask him too. I am disappointed. - Tue Oct 27 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You and me both. - Tue Oct 27 00:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Right right. - Tue Oct 27 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Stay around for a bit, he might come back. - Tue Oct 27 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'll inform you if he does. - Tue Oct 27 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So... what do you wanna do? Go Cuddle, have something to eat, train? - Tue Oct 27 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Cuddle and eat sounds fine.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So... to that place we're renting, rather than a resturant, or..?~ - Tue Oct 27 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: The rent house.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods at that, smiling gently as she leads the way.

"Alright then.~"* - Tue Oct 27 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: North hun.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: On this road.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Here.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) walks into their rented home and yawns, stretching out with a smile and turning to face Ai.

"Mrm...~ So, who shall cook?"* - Tue Oct 27 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Well.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You'll have to decide on that, I'm not much of a great cook.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Ah... well, I suppose I'll get to it then. Mrm.. you just get comfortable, I s'pose!~ - Tue Oct 27 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Well.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I do want to help ya.~ - Tue Oct 27 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) turns to walk into the small kitchen area, looking around thoughtfully as she taps her chin, searching pantries.

"Hrm?"* - Tue Oct 27 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slightly, stroking her chin as she starts to reach for assorted meats, noodles- and begins to fill a pot with water.

"Mrm.. so how do you mean to help?"* - Tue Oct 27 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slightly- then smiles.

"Alright then. Go to the spice cabinet and get me... hrm. Garlic, and... whatever you like on your meat, I guess." She suggests calmly- as she sets the pan of water on the stove- and it starts to heat rapidly as she then lets the noodles into it; while she pulls out a seperate pan, into which she tosses the meat straight.* - Tue Oct 27 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods calmly- tossing a series of springles of the desired spices over the meat as it sizzles on the pan, even as the water around the noodles begins to boil, heating the pan and softening the noodles.

"Mrm.. this may take a bit.." She muses softly.* - Tue Oct 27 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) hums softly as he works quickly and smoothly- flash frying the assorted meats; salmon, beef, and chicken- while spicing them with the assortment that she was given by Ai. She sighs happily at the gentle kiss- as meanwhile, the Noodles begin to break apart and soften fully; at which point she shifts the meat out of the pan, and into the pot with the noodles; turning the heat off there, and stirring in the spices just a little more; as the entire result takes on a brownish color.

From there, she begins to serve the meal out into two bowls, humming.

It's about five minutes of rest for Ai later, that she calls out in a cheerful voice.

"Ai-Chan!~ Food's done!~" She says brightly- as she holds two bowls.* - Tue Oct 27 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles softly at that- blushing but faintly as she sits down on the floor, and offers one of the bowls complete with chopsticks towards Ai, and then sets her own down before herself, sitting cross legged.

"Mrm.. well, I hope you like it! It's a pasta dish, with assorted meats and spices." She explains calmly- as she then.. begins to eat- aiming to use her chopsticks to snap up meat and noodles in the same bites as much as possible, humming.* - Tue Oct 27 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) meanwhile, eats hungrily. It's a moderately meat heavy dish, and certainly rich in flavor; if the garlic is, perhaps, a bit too strong. Still- she eats hungrily and cheerfully, and as Ai finishes, she finds that Ketsuki has as well. She wipes her lips and sighs happily- smiling at Ai.

"Mrm... yeah, it was. Thanks!~" She says brightly, as she sets aside the two bowls on the counter- before shifting to hug Ai, and nuzzle into her neck. "..Mrm. Thanks for the compliments, and thanks for being here.."* - Tue Oct 27 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) brushes her lips back against Ai's in that brief kiss- humming gently as she does- letting Ai simply pull her into the other girls lap, as she wraps her legs around Ai's waist and her arms around her back- nuzzling and cuddling happily against her.

She hears those three words- and her heart flutters and skips a bit... and then she smiles serenely, happily, latched onto her as she pulls her head out of Ai's shoulder, to be face to face with her.

"We're moving so fast, but.... I think that... I love you too, Ai.~" She says- warmth and gentle kindness in her tone, as she leans forwards to press her lips against Ai's own from her position; a gentle, brushing kiss.* - Tue Oct 27 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) holds her close- lips initially simply brushing against the other womans own, before she presses closer- not breaking contact, but rather deepening it as she lifts her lips, pulls slightly back, then pushes back forth. Small motions- like she was shown yesterday, as she nibbles on Ai's upper lip before sliding back down..

As meanwhile, her legs wrap tight and she almost grinds against Ai as she shifts slightly against her- arms around the other woman holding her warm and tight- as Ketsuki simply enjoys the closeness, the warmth, the care and compassion. 

Despite her mannerisms and general actions, Ketsuki had always been a very lonely person- but this kind of close companionship, it feels good; filling a hole she didn't even realize was there with warmth and happiness.* - Tue Oct 27 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) gasps softly as the sensations and warmth flow through her. Her eyes flutter shut as she rubs her body against the other woman- slowly pushing her towards the ground as she leans into her; breasts pressing against Ai's chest, legs wrapped around her sides...

And lips, latched onto Ai's own hungrily, passion guiding her as she let's her tongue gently press out from between her lips- touching at Ai's own lips gently as her teeth brush against her lovers bottom lip for but a moment, before she let's out a low moaning gasp- wordless as she breaks the kiss for but a moment, panting lightly as her cheeks flush bright red; eyes locked with Ai's as she trembles so close to her.* - Tue Oct 27 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) pants hungrily, staring into her lovers eyes as her own almost seem to glaze over with a passionate lust and love, mixed into a boiling pot. She's never really felt like this before meeting Ai- and it feels so good, it feels so right.

And so of course, she wants more- so she pushes for more. She pushes her lips back against Ai; no longer merely brushing against her lips, but passionaltely pressing against them as she first gently nibbles on Ai's upper lip- before once more extending her tongue to lick at Ai's own lips, before tangling against Ai's own if it answers the call.

She pushes her fully down; pinning her beneath her own body as her hands rove her lovers form; one sliding up to stroke through her hair lovingly; the other sliding down to cup her rear firmly.

Soft gasps of pleasure and hunger as she presses, and her eyes shutting once more as she moves.* - Tue Oct 27 02:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) groans aloud as she's held back, grinding herself into Ai; her own rear is firm much like most of her musuclar body; an athelete's ass, to be crass. She's the picture of fitness; what was generally implied before is now made absolutely certain of by physical contact..

Even as she strokes Ai's hair lovingly, and squeezes on her ass, she continues the passionate, heated kiss; lips parting more fully as her tongue presses against Ai's own, twisting and writhing against it.

Her body is hot and warm- a tightly wound coil of muscle and body against her lover's form that writhes and presses against her. Soft moans escape her lips as she pushes out her rear into her lovers hand, enjoying that feeling, too.

The idle curiosity in the back of her mind wonders if Ai is actually a very feminine boy, or just a girl who identifies as a man. She's not sure which it is yet- and she nudges between her lovers legs with a gentle caress of her knee to check while she's so close; wondering, but not wanting to ask.* - Tue Oct 27 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) wiggles her rear into those hands- internally both suprised and happy. While she herself has always felt secure in the simple knowledge that she swings both ways, this is still her first actual relationship- and she's still uncertain and untested, logically.

Of course- logic has nothing to do with her state right now, as she runs that knee along that something her leg has felt, moving slowly and gently to try and make her lover feel good.

Her head tilts slightly with her lovers, as she swallows back some of her lovers saliva in turn, breathing in and out through her nose as she enjoys the pleasure, the moment; her own moans soft and gentle, her pants muffled by the lips locked in ecstasy with her own; her body aflame with a burning heat she cannot dull, only stoke higher and higher.* - Tue Oct 27 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) groans out- that purring sound only turning her on more, as her knee rubs through the clothes. She isn't sure where this is going- will they continue to just make out? Will they go even farther? She has no idea- she doesn't care, even; she's not thinking of what will happen next, merely exalting in the bliss of the moment as her tongue tangos with her lovers- her saliva dripping across that link.

Her firm, tight little ass rubbing against the hands against it; her muscular, taught legs tingling as she's stroked. Her full, lush breasts presing into her lovers chest; all in all, she's in heaven through sheer proximity, as she burns with passion.

Her lips part- and soft words escape her. "I want you.."* - Tue Oct 27 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) licks her lips, breathing deep and hard; panting raggedly as she holds her close- then her hands shift. Her hand strokes down her lovers back out of her hair- and down to her pants...

Where it starts to work on undoing them, fumbling with the buckles as she brings her lips back in to resume the kiss from before for but a moment; a heated, passionate moment of lips meeting, before she pulls out of that to shift- leaning against her lover as she continues to work at undoing his pants...

And whispering in his ear, lips brushing against flesh, hot breath blowing through his earlobe...

"I think I will, m'love.~" She almost purrs, her eyes half glazed over and burning with a potent hunger; along with a deep compassion. Love and lust, lust and love- in this moment, intertwined.e* - Tue Oct 27 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) deftly slides those pants down, revealing that impressive pole. She breaks from the kiss, blushing bright.

"I... hope we're not... uhm.. moving too fast.." She says softly- her cheeks flushed red as her confidence shifts- even as she takes the hand that unbuckled those pants away- and grasps around the base of Ai's rod- rubbing at it, stroking it tentatively with her hand- working up and down from the base to the tip.

"But... I think I... I want to move fast, with how little time we have.. you know..? We'll be apart for long periods of time so.. I think it's just right to.. make what time we have.. ah.. count." She explains softly- blushing even brighter; as she rubs and strokes and grips at the cock in her hand, biting a lip awkwardly as she stares at her.

"....But if we do this I.. I want you to take charge... o-okay..?"* - Tue Oct 27 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blushes- then nods and grins wide. She nibbles on her own lower lip a while longer- as she shifts her position- unlatching her legs from around her lovers waist- and leaning back; obviously nervous in the face of what's about to happen.

"It's my... first time, so.." She trails of- leaving what doesn't need to be said unsaid, as she continues to stroke the rock hard member; getting it ready, stroking it to make her lover feel better.

Those eyes still shining with that twisted mix of lust and love, as she bites harder on her lip and smiles broadly- spreading her legs slightly.

"....Let's have.. the best time..~"* - Tue Oct 27 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stands out in the training field, practically aglow with a warm happiness from the night before. She's flowing through her forms as usual with the Tanto- and as usual, idly wishing she had a proper Katana. Her form is increasingly deft and fluid by the day, it sometimes seems; and her training routine is as consistent as ever.

The tanto flows through the air with each cut, as she steps in and through the forms. Diagonal sweeps, upwards snaps, step back and thrust forwards; matching footwork to different manuvears of the blade, working on her flexibility; all of it.

And through it all, that beaming smile never leaves the young girls face; a certain joy radiating from her in the wake of last night with her lover, even as a certain soreness makes the forms a little more awkward at first, until it fades into the background of burn from strain that everything is when working out.* - Tue Oct 27 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah, Takeda. Hey. - Tue Oct 27 22:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods, smiling gently with her hands in her pockets.

"Glad to hear it."* - Tue Oct 27 22:16:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I refuse to accept this kind of bullshit. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't give a shit about him, he's a monstrous idiot. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Might as well call this place the village of death. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Everyone that comes here seems to die. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Wouldn't be surprised if the Hokage was dead. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) clenches her fists and tilts her head back, grimacing.

"....Kami above, but that would just be the icing on the cake, wouldn't it..? Tch..."* - Tue Oct 27 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Not really, He'd just be another dead Hokage. - Tue Oct 27 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: We'd find another, and the cycle would continue. - Tue Oct 27 22:25:42 2015
