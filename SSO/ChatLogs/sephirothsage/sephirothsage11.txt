<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: A girl told me that he arrived around five minutes after the Mizukage died and asked what happened, which left her to believe that he wasn't the one that did it. I just have a hard time believing that he wasn't involved. - Wed Nov  4 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Kana didn't take the news of her brother's death too bad though. She kind of just walked off. - Wed Nov  4 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Especially since he was in Sand before that and went to the village right before the attack. Everything points to him being the one..but anyway. - Wed Nov  4 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I don't know if Ortho killed the Mizukage, but I do know he killed the other two. - Wed Nov  4 23:41:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Everyone claims to be working in the name of peace to justify whatever they want. - Wed Nov  4 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What he did won't promote peace. - Wed Nov  4 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: His death will, though. - Wed Nov  4 23:43:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I think I did see someone named Baen. He threatened to kill me. - Wed Nov  4 23:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Taijutsu isn't my forte, sorry. - Wed Nov  4 23:46:46 2015

And then her foot zips backwards towards this mans groin with no comment made.* - Thu Nov  5 21:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) frowns slightly at Ai, rubbing his back as she crooks an eyebrow.

"...Ai, you can trust me, y'know."* - Fri Nov  6 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ..A'right then.. - Fri Nov  6 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares in suprise- catching Ai easily due to having already had her hands around her; a low curse escaping her.

"Come on, I told you to /tell/ me if you wheren't okay!" She hisses out- as she shifts from simply holding Ai by the back, to holding him in a bridal carry; strong arms shifting smoothly.

"...Okay, uhh.. shit, is anyone here a medic? Okay- where is the hospital?"* - Fri Nov  6 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I see shes getting her rest. - Fri Nov  6 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Oh don't worry, when I trained with my dad. I use to pass out all the time, and I turned out fine! - Fri Nov  6 00:52:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) grimaces, holding up Ai with a frown on her lips as the man breathes heavily and seems to have fainted.

"Someone- help- I have no idea what to do about this, he just.. he had a fever, and now he's just dropped- is anyone here a medic- if not, someone help me get him to the hospital!" SHe cries out- having zero medical knowledge whatsoever to help Ai with.* - Fri Nov  6 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) frowns- then nods at Inou, lowering Ai down gently and absently correcting her.

"He." She says softly, as she sets the body down and looks at Erin. "Ah.. I'm not sure it is just a fever though- I'm really not. He just fainted out of nowhere, and he's breathing really heavily.."* - Fri Nov  6 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) frowns at this, looking down at the body.

"...A cut..? He was poisoned..!?" She cries out in alarm as she stares at the cut on his hand- before her eyes snap to Erin.

"You're a medic, right..? You can fix this, right..?"* - Fri Nov  6 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Uh..oh... I hope she..- he is going to be fine. - Fri Nov  6 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) tenses as she looks down at the man on the ground before her, hands clasped together tightly as if in prayer as she bites her lip, worry written all over her face as she leans back, out of the medics way while she watches.

"Please.. please be alright.."* - Fri Nov  6 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) thinks: Ergh... he's actually poisoned.. - Fri Nov  6 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares in a quiet panic at Ai's body- before looking to the medic.

"It's Poison- if you can't treat it here, can you at least delay the damage so we can get him to the hospital..?" She says softly- fear in her tone.* - Fri Nov  6 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: The medicine should delayed the inclination of the fever's severity. - Fri Nov  6 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares on with obvious worry... then nods, as she moves to grab her lover under the armpits to lift Ai's torso and help carry him to the hospital.* - Fri Nov  6 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) helps carry Ai.* - Fri Nov  6 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sighs with relief, frowning and nodding as she looks on.

"...Right.. I see. So... He'll be fine?" She says softly- looking at the Medic with a frown. "..I will have to find out how he got poisoned from him.. once he woke up- but it's odd, he didn't seem to know about being poisoned before it happened.."* - Fri Nov  6 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov  6 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) looks on with obvious worry as numerous nurses and medics work over Ai, hands clasped together as if in prayer.

"...Come on. They said it's not fatal- so stop worrying me like this and live, you baka.."* - Fri Nov  6 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ... - Fri Nov  6 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) puts a hand on Ai's forehead; concern gleaming in her eyes as she looks down at him.

"Hey... you okay?" She says softly, frowning.* - Fri Nov  6 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: No...I..Feel like...Crap.. - Fri Nov  6 02:07:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So you just need to rest here in the hospital while being treated for a while.. - Fri Nov  6 02:11:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) stares at Ai, sighing gently as her hand gently strokes his forehead, brushing hair out of the way.

"...Shh. I feel a lot more sad that you're injured, than I do about not being able to see you so much because you're in a hospital bed. This isn't going to be my last time visiting Sunagakure, after all- it's not like this is a one time thing. Just concentrate on getting better."* - Fri Nov  6 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods slowly, smiling gently.

"A'right, I'll look for Bryson. For now? You rest." She insists calmly, before kissing Ai on the forehead, and turning to leave.* - Fri Nov  6 02:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) smiles and turns to wave cheerfully at her freind from that mission a while back, humming cheerfully.

"It's been a while, huh?"* - Fri Nov  6 02:45:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) frowns, narrowing her eyes as she readies herself for movement; eyes scanning the area around her.

"This is bad..."* - Fri Nov  6 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Hey, Sanoke. Can you tell anything wrong with anyone here? - Fri Nov  6 02:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) turns to look at Mana, frowning as the woman seems frozen. She turns to approach her, compassion in her eyes as she starts to walk slowly.

"Miss... are you okay? Are you unharmed... did you see at all what happened?"* - Fri Nov  6 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabara, Izutora(Get Jazzy) says: Let us go to the hospital and the inn! - Fri Nov  6 02:55:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: Besides, if a genin like me could take out two shinobi unnoticed, then we've been doomed from the start. - Fri Nov  6 02:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Had to be. - Fri Nov  6 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: --! - Fri Nov  6 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) has been searching for a while now- and eventually runs into her target.

Sadly, the young Shinobi is not quick enough to stop the suprise attack waiting for her upon finding the infiltrator of the village she is visiting. She reaches for her weapon, opening her mouth as her eyes widen; but he has her in a grab within seconds as she struggles angrily...

Trying to struggle, however, doesn't get her anywhere as his forearm pressesi n the suffocation hold, and collapses the young Shinobi into unconsciousness.

"Gya-...!"* - Fri Nov  6 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: - Shit, Bathroom! - Fri Nov  6 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) meanwhile, drops to the ground; laying limp against the earth as she slumps in pain. She's unconscious- knocked out by the quick closure of her airpassages, she is left on the ground as she is removed completey from this fight, except perhaps as an obstacle on the floor of the bathroom, to be used as a meatshield by anyone amoral enough.* - Fri Nov  6 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: ...Am I... this useless? - Fri Nov  6 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hoo boy. - Fri Nov  6 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) groans in pain on the floor, completely unconscious- dreaming dreams of being far, far more useful.* - Fri Nov  6 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) sits limp as bomb-spiders come to rest on her body.

Poor Mook tier Genin.* - Fri Nov  6 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) groans as she is woken back up- stirring to awareness quickly due in part to her own very good health, and in part due to the physical contact of the other mans actions. She stirs to awakeness and looks up at Kuro.

"Shit.. what happened..? DId he get away..? I found him in the bathroom, but.." She groans groggily, as she rubs her throat. It looks like she was slipped into unconsciousness by pressure to the throat, from the markings and reddening of her throat- even as she pushes herself up.

"Kuro.. what's goin on..?"* - Fri Nov  6 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I ah... - Fri Nov  6 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Don't know anything about treating wounds. - Fri Nov  6 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But I do know how to fight. - Fri Nov  6 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I can't do anything to help that guy- but I might be able to help if I come against that guy. - Fri Nov  6 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't know..I don't want to kill the man, and I don't want anyone to die.  - Fri Nov  6 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) speaks calmly, as she steadies herself fully- and it becomes readily apparent she was not wounded outside being rendered unconscious; though she does still have a few spiders clinging to her.

"You don't want to kill a man who is openly trying to slaughter his way out of this village?"* - Fri Nov  6 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't believe in taking a life. I'm going to end this on my terms. - Fri Nov  6 04:59:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Good Luck...Hrm? - Fri Nov  6 05:00:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Holy fucking -shit-. - Fri Nov  6 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) meanwhile, follows Kuro as well- rubbing her forehead as she walks into the doorway and begins to quietly and quickly analyze the situation, a slight frown on her lips as the man continues to move around and battle the others, as she scans the room quickly as she can.

"Ach shit.." She murmurs- as she forms a single seal, rapidly throwing herself out into the hallway at highspeed- a few spiders still loosely clinging to her heavy jacket, but most displaced by her highspeed movement as she takes a position in the hallway, between Macbeth and the exit.

Her expression is solem and quiet, as she reaches for her sword upon settling.

"You caught me by suprise earlier, but..!" She murmurs to herself- praying for the good fortune to actually do something in this fight.* - Fri Nov  6 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Wait. - Fri Nov  6 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Why was he electrocuted by that?  - Fri Nov  6 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: How odd.... - Fri Nov  6 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Does his 'gravity' conduct electricity or something? - Fri Nov  6 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: That's not it. - Fri Nov  6 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Nonetheless, the battlefield is now mine. - Fri Nov  6 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Plus, it appears as though his gravity is limited in range? Otherwise, he would've just smashed us all into the wall. - Fri Nov  6 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: So what if he's faced with something gravity cannot stop? - Fri Nov  6 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: I think I have a plan... - Fri Nov  6 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Oh very very naughty. - Fri Nov  6 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods calmly as Kuro speaks; slowly moving not to engage the man, but to retreat. However, rather than drawing her sword as she initially planned, she startsforming handseals. She's not trying to engage the man in close combat- he's simply too much for her.. however.

She doesn't know if /this/ will work or not; as she forms a Genjutsu and attempts to apply it to him; putting her handseals fully in the open as she does so; intending to catch him in a relatively basic genjutsu- in which the first stage would be a swirl of debris and black leaves falling from the ceiling, before it dredges out his deepest, darkest fear.* - Fri Nov  6 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Koeki(ZuuZuu) thinks: Are they fighting? - Fri Nov  6 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Koeki(ZuuZuu) thinks: Such strange jutsu that one is using. - Fri Nov  6 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: I only have to test -one- more thing. - Fri Nov  6 06:01:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Koeki(ZuuZuu) thinks: This guy would be easy game.. - Fri Nov  6 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Koeki(ZuuZuu) thinks: Even i can see his movements clearly.. - Fri Nov  6 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) meanwhile, steps back as her foe is broken free of the Genjutsu- then attacked by the series of moves. She takes a deep breath, as she manuvears slightly backwards, waiting to see if the man breaks free or not.

"..Hrm... Will he live, or..?"* - Fri Nov  6 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: . . . . . . . . - Fri Nov  6 06:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) nods, forming the tiger seal and flickering towards the door and out of the building, sprinting for a medic.* - Fri Nov  6 06:46:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) hits the barrier and fuckin bounces.* - Fri Nov  6 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: *Outside* Who the hell is trying to get out?...Is that a signal for setting off the trap?... - Fri Nov  6 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) taps on the barrier, confused as she pushes against it.

"...What kind of a barrier is this..?!" She murmurs- a few spiders still clinging to her jacket as she sways back and forth; having drained out most of her chakra in this short battle..

"Ugh.."* - Fri Nov  6 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: . . . . - Fri Nov  6 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) meanwhile, rubs her forehead as she steps back from the barrier- then looks over towards the man.. and blinks.

"...Oh. So you.. want to die, because you lost..? Or because you don't want to go to prison..?" She tilts her head to the side. "Even though you tried to kill people and leave others to deal with that, you don't want to deal with any long term consequences here- just die or win, huh..?" She trails off, as she squints at him.

"...Why do you want to die, when you could potentially live?"* - Fri Nov  6 07:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) blinks briefly at that. She isn't expecting this; as she turns to wait for a response, the two spiders on her shoulders clinging to her coat detonate.

There is a flash of light around her body; and then there is nothing left of her but ash on the wind, giving her no time to react to what is happening before she is dead and gone; the blast exploding from her body on her approach towards the downed necromancer...

The several spiders clinging to her heavy leather coat from when she was coated in them having left nothing of her butt dust on the wind.* - Fri Nov  6 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) is in the process of moving to get closer to Macbeth, to hear his response. There is no warning before it happens; there is nothing that she can percieve; smiling gently one second as she steps forwards to close with Macbeth.

And then a moment later, a flash of light. The spiders clinging to her coat on the in and outside gleam; and a split second later, her arms are blown away from her body in a sudden explosion of light and blood that shatters bones and burns her body; her scream helpless and shocked as she drops to her knees in pain; howling in desperation as blood begins to flow from the two wounds.

The rest of her body is badly burnt and damaged, and at the shoulders her arms are simply gone; the rest of her body simply engulfed in horrific burns.

"Gyah..?"* - Fri Nov  6 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Macbeth(Psychic_Warrior) says: S-Stop...... - Fri Nov  6 07:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Macbeth(Psychic_Warrior) says: To save me.... - Fri Nov  6 07:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) meanwhile, lays wide eyed on the ground for a long moment; the entire world slowing down to her perception as she looks on.

She see's a man who just tried to kill her and many others saved before her own life. She tries to comprehend what just killed her- her mind slowing down to try and comprehend it all; as it all falls apart... and then her eyes close, as she drops to the ground.

Slipping from consciousness as that brief moment ends, and the blood drips away, her broken body barely clinging to life as an act of will for a moment longer. There are no words from her lips- just a strangled cry of pain as her last physical action is to try and reach forrwards, before going completely limp in unconsciousness..

Still alive, somewhat; but only barely, and not for long if no one applies healing of a high order and soon.* - Fri Nov  6 07:37:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) is still for a long moment- her mind slowly wondering what happened in confusion. She was so happy not just a little while ago- engaged to be married to a kind, gentle man, falling fully in love. Spending her time visiting her lover in his own village.

Making new freinds. Training- yearning and reaching for a distant goal, and watching Konoha grow. She is confused then- as her life ends with no warning, no reason that she understands or knows.

Her soul and heart cry out in despair and pain- and then go still and silent, as her life fades away; the explosion only leaving her in that absolute pain and hopelessness for a little while, before her body slumps against the wooden ground.* - Fri Nov  6 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: ...Budha.. god... why? - Fri Nov  6 08:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) walks up behind the two, crooking an eyebrow as she adjusts her flowing robe.* - Fri Nov  6 18:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I see. - Fri Nov  6 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks on that, as she approaches; smiling faintly.

"It sure has, hasn't it..?" The pale faced, purple haired and violet eyed woman muses as she approaches, hands inside her sleeves. She's not wearing a headband visibly at the moment- and looks for all the world just like some wealthy civilian in her flowing robe, with her refined features.

"Greetings, then... Mrm. Hello!"* - Fri Nov  6 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles gently and bows her head slightly back, leaving her hands in the sleeves.

"Mrm... I am quite well, thank you for asking- how are you..? Hrm- are you alright..? You seem... off center.... is something wrong?" She inquires serenely.* - Fri Nov  6 18:43:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods serenely, smiling gently as she tilts her head to the side.

"Yes, I understand. It's not easy to go against ones nature, after all.." She muses, trailing off with a gentle smile, before nodding. "Still, it is possible- but only if you /want/ to. If such is your desire, I would advise meditation, and perhaps violence. If you wish to remain as you are.." She chuckles softly.

"There is nothing wrong with that." She says warmly- as she meanwhile, internally muses over how doomed such a person would be if they cannot change.* - Fri Nov  6 18:52:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) yawns and shrugs at the discussion.

"As you like, I suppose. It's not my business how you prefer to be, I must say- so as I said, if you are happy as you are, then that is all well and good." She says simply, smiling gently.* - Fri Nov  6 19:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) looks around the town square; a relaxed and almost lazy smile resting on the purple haired womans lips as she does. Her posture is entirely relaxed as she stands there- looking about.

She's a beautiful woman, clad in a flowing red robe of various shades; maroon and burgandy, flowing with a dark, almost blood red shade- and at her hip, encased in simple, plain white wood, rests a Katana as she looks around- then bows, as she notices Hassan.

"Ah... Hello." She says softly, a gentle smile on her lips.* - Sun Nov  8 08:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) blinks as she walks out into the arena- to find the arena occupied. Her eyes rove around the field calmly as she crooks an eyebrow upwards.

"Hrm..? A fight, huh..?" She muses softly; a gentle smile on her lips as she looks over those participating, and those nearby. "Interesting." She murmurs simply as she steps forwards, hand at her sides.

"Interesting. What seems to be going on here?" She inquires calmly.* - Sun Nov  8 08:14:04 2015

"Mrm... such strong people. So is anyone else here a... Genin level individual, by chance? I've been wanting to get into a sparring match for some time now, and I'd enjoy a foe on my level, rather than one massively stronger than me."* - Sun Nov  8 08:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) sighs, tilting her head back and frowning as she does.

"Mrm.. Oh. It's nice to meet you all. I'm Mitsunara." She says simply, nodding her head slightly. Her skin is pale looking, as she rubs her hair back with one hand and frowns slightly.

"Ah, and I was.. really hoping for a good spar on my own level.." She murmurs with a frown.* - Sun Nov  8 08:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, I'm heading home. - Sun Nov  8 08:29:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm going home to smoke some pot. Want to tag along? - Sun Nov  8 08:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Have you guys seen Tetsuki around? - Sun Nov  8 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: I can check. - Sun Nov  8 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: I'm somewhat of a sensor, master. - Sun Nov  8 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) yawns lazily, stretching out as she turns and gestures for Yan to lead the way. She nods slightly as he speaks.

"Mrm, indeed." She says with a gentle smile, hands sliding into the folds of her red robes. Her eyes are, notably, extremely narrowed; halfway closed it almost seems; slits of violet with her eyelashes over them as she smiles a lazy half smile.

"It's a pleasure to meet you- as I said, I am Mitsunara... a swordswoman." She explains calmly.* - Sun Nov  8 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) stretches out- smiling gently as she turns to head towards the cushioned pillows surrounding the table, bowing her head gently.

"Ah... thank you for having me within your home, yeah..? Regardless.... Sake, yeah. So.. you liked Kenjutsu, but didnt' end up deciding on it, huh?" She says curiously, leaning against the wall as she sits cross legged on a pillow, smiling gently with those thin, slit like eyes that betray no real emotions.* - Sun Nov  8 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as the man states his faith- nodding slightly, a relaxed smile on her lips. Her eyes remain most of the way shut, barely open at all in a somewhat eerie fashion as she looks towards the other man; her own sandals removed and set neatly near the door. Her Katana however, is worn at her hip.

"Mrm...I see- a divine gift, huh..?" She muses with a teasing tone, shaking her head and smiling gently. "Perhaps. I think it more likely that your talent and chakra are a result of fate and hardwork, than the work of any sentient divine- but that is simply my belief on the topic." She admits calmly, as she takes one of the two glass cups; holding it in a suprisingly gentle grip.

She clinks it against his, and nods. "Regardless. To a new friendship, yes." She says in that same lazy, calm tone as she pulls it back, and takes a brief sip- quietly analyzing this man before her.* - Sun Nov  8 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) hums softly as she sips her drink for a long moment before setting it down on the table, smiling gently; letting out a sigh of contentment as the drink burns it's way down her throat- as if she's simply used to hard alchohol; enough to have developed a taste for it, if the way she waits for a few moments to swallow; letting the flavor rest on her tongue as she looks to him, smiling gently.

"Mrm...I smoke when I can, to be frank. It's an enjoyable hobby- not my only one, but.." She chuckles softly. "It's a fine way to unwind every now and then- and it's been a good while since I got a chance." She says simply, a placid smile on her lips as she leans back against the wall- taking in a deep breath as he sets the tray down.

"Phew... smells like some strong stuff, too." She muses cheerily, scratching the side of her head with a smile. "Mind if I ask where you get your supply?"* - Sun Nov  8 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods calmly, smiling as cooly as ever as she accepts the bowl and lights it- smoothly taking a hit and breathing it in as way of response, before breathing out and leaning back.

"Mrm... Hrm?" She blinks a few times, then nods, smiling laxly. "Ah, right.. well. Call me wierd- but I really enjoy violence, y'know? That is- fighting. I like getting a chance to test my swordplay." She explains initially, smiling laxly. "I'm also a fan of creating and apreciating artwork, mhrm."* - Sun Nov  8 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles serenely as she leans back; seeming to be relaxed and entirely at ease despite being in a man she just met's home; whether that is the weed, the booze, or something else entirely, is unsure. However- a few things are certain, at least.

She is oddly still, even as she takes another hit while he speaks after setting it down, before setting it down to reply- smiling gently as she accepts her glass being refilled.

"Mrm, that so, huh..? So you got used to it, and... from how you put it.. doing it as your job rather than a hobby makes it less fun, then?" She muses cheerily, a lax smile on her lips as she relaxes, nodding slightly.

"If that's the case, you should pursue needless, recreational violence sometimes. Not like, murder or anything- but fighting for the fun of it is a lot more fun than fighting because you have to, y'know."* - Sun Nov  8 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods slowly at that, soaking in the mans words and keeping her eyes on Yan as he speaks; analyzing his thoughts as she speaks in a soft, almost melodic tone as she leans against the wall, blade resting in her lap casually as she takes a long drink from her cup of Sake.

"Mrm.. I see. Do you enjoy being challenged- or playing with your foes and knowing you can end it at any time, holding back to fight someone weaker? Or maybe you enjoy an even, back and forth fight...?" She trails of, smiling faintly.

"Still... I understand what you meant. Letting compassion interfere with your judgements when lives are on the line- that is a foolish thing, isn't it? I agree wholeheartedly; when you need to take a life, hesitation will ensure that it is you that dies." She says- melodic and silken tone slipping out of her lips as she smiles gently.

"Mrm....So, have you killed many people?"* - Sun Nov  8 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Indirectly or otherwise, quite a few. I'm not bragging or anything, but it's hard to find someone who really challenges me....So I take what I can get I guess. - Sun Nov  8 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see... Mrm. - Sun Nov  8 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You? - Sun Nov  8 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So you're pretty strong, huh..? - Sun Nov  8 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Me..? - Sun Nov  8 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Oh, I've yet to take a life. I've thought about it, yeah.. - Sun Nov  8 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: But I've yet to.. have a chance. - Sun Nov  8 09:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. I don't see my self as that strong. There are alot of shinobi with ninjutsu, and even genjutsu, that I can't really match...But I have a skill set that allows me to move around that. I'm a pretty versatile ninja. - Sun Nov  8 09:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'd say I'm more clever than the average ninja. - Sun Nov  8 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see.. Mrm. Maybe we'll have a sparring match sometime- a good chance to test myself. - Sun Nov  8 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Me, I'm simply.. - Sun Nov  8 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I have a very strong body. - Sun Nov  8 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Oh? I'll keep that in mind. Eh-heh. - Sun Nov  8 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Oho? - Sun Nov  8 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well...Mitsunara, I think I'm going to jump in the shower and hit the hay. You want some to take with you? I mean, if you have no place to stay, you can sleep on my couch. - Sun Nov  8 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly and nods slowly, smiling gently.

"Mrm. I wouldn't mind taking a small bag home with me... as for staying the night- don't worry about me. I'll be on my way shortly, yeah?" She says serenely, cracking her shoulders as she looks around.

"I've got things to do, after all. I'll rest later- and I've got my own place, mhrm."* - Sun Nov  8 09:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods, smiling gently as she tips back the last of her cup of Sake before tucking the baggie into her robes in a smooth motion. She stretches out before pushing herself up to stand, smiling placidly as she looks to Yan.

"Regardless. Thanks for letting me hang out for a while, and for the company. See you around, yeah?" She says calmly, stretching her arms out again to either side as she accepts the hand up.* - Sun Nov  8 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) nods with a gentle smile, stretching out as she heads for the door.

"Yeah, see you around man."* - Sun Nov  8 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Could I get some of your names here? I am interested in meeting all of you since i'm still pretty new. - Sun Nov  8 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: ackackack. - Sun Nov  8 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) approaches the scene, humming softly with a gentle smile on her lips- hands in her pockets as she looks around.

"Hrm..?" She murmurs softly, scratching her head.* - Sun Nov  8 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm Kuro. - Sun Nov  8 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: My name is Kurt, Pleasure to meet you. - Sun Nov  8 20:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Pleasure to meet you as well. - Sun Nov  8 20:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm... Hey, Kurt. It's been a while. - Sun Nov  8 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Mhm, Hello again. - Sun Nov  8 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles faintly as she walks up. It is perhaps worth noting that she's wearing some kind of a sword on her hip- a contrast from the last time Kurt saw the supposed civilian; supposed, but likely not considering where she is.

"How are you?" She inquires lazily, thin eyes looking over the field quietly.* - Sun Nov  8 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I am doing pretty good, What about you? - Sun Nov  8 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I am.. quite well. - Sun Nov  8 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I see you have taken a liking to Kenjutsu, Are you aiming to increase your skill in the usage of a Katana? - Sun Nov  8 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Um... Koji you know more techniques of our clan right? Do you have their descriptions written in a scroll or anything? - Sun Nov  8 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You could say that. I think if you want to really understand why I'm carrying a sword, we'd have to spar. Heh. There is a fine arena not too far away.. - Sun Nov  8 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: We can spar if you'd like then. - Sun Nov  8 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I might be a bit short on time but I'll make due. - Sun Nov  8 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm... I think that'd be worth doing. Shall we head on over, then..? - Sun Nov  8 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Mhm. Let's get going then. - Sun Nov  8 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'll go finish up that drill after this... - Sun Nov  8 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I am. - Sun Nov  8 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) yawns serenely as she starts to walk towards the Arena- a playful smile on those lips, as her lazy seeming eyes quietly analyze everything nearby.* - Sun Nov  8 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles softly as she draws her own blade in a fluid, smooth movement- stepping forwards calmly as she does- holding the weapon in a one handed grip at first, off to her side; left handed and firm as she takes a few steps forward- speaking casually, a faint smile on her lips.

"Yes, let's dance."* - Sun Nov  8 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles faintly. She doesn't move save to turn to face him; not bothering to try and avoid his initial strike; shifting on the spot. His blade strikes against her body; pressing against her...

And does nothing. His hand hurts as her body endures the strike with no seeming consequences; he feels like he just tried to strike down metal with his Katana, as she turns and sweeps her blade for his gut with a suprisingly deft movement.

Her skill, he then realizes, is not that of a novice. Not even near that of someone who only recently picked up the Katana, as she turns- her dress slightly cut- but her skin beneath it actively repelling his strike- as she pivots into a two handed stroke from hip to shoulder with her Katana.

"Fine skill- but weak strength." She judges him as she moves smoothly, smiling playfully.* - Sun Nov  8 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) staggers away as he seems to blur in his movement. A frown on her lips as she loses track of him until the blow strikes her in the back. She begins to move as if to turn to face him; but predicting his movements, rather than trying to actually cope with his speed...

She reverses mid swing to strike what is about to be behind her; even as his blade barely draws any blood; though this time, it leaves a scrape against her skin; not touching her body seriously as her muscles tighten to repell the strike..

Even as she starts to turn to face him again.. only to slam her foot down and spin her blade back to slice through where would be behind her if she had turned around; reversing her spin to catch him if he tries the same trick again.* - Sun Nov  8 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ...? - Sun Nov  8 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) laughs aloud; that lazy, half smile ripping her face apart as it spreads into an almost manic green; as that thin line of blood trickling from her back barely drips away from her torso; even as she shifts her blade in the clash to slam the hilt up into his own blade; even as he overpowers her in raw strength for a moment to push her back, she fights /smart/.

During the blade lock, rather than let him disengage with no risk, she levers her blade down over his to push it down with basic leverage, then thrusts forwards to stab him while their blades are locked together, even as she holds her ground against being pushed back; hoping to land a blow before he disengages away.

"Waaahaha!" She laughs out- those thin, always narrowed eyes, widening into gleaming violet orbs as she shifts in place. "Man, you really are fast.."* - Sun Nov  8 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ..... - Sun Nov  8 21:25:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: YOU FUCKING TEASE! - Sun Nov  8 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) glares angrily at him for a moment; as she seems to have just begun to get worked up in response to his prowess in battle.. only for him to leave just as the fight got /good/ for her.

She sighs, then- leaning her head back and frowning back into that same thin line, her eyes seeming to halfway close as she breathes out to relax; regaining control of her emotions...

"...I see. Apologies for my outburst. I look forward to next time- if you have to leave, then leave." She says- a certain coldness slipping into the swordsmans words as she sheathes her blade smoothly... then looks to the audience and crooks an eyebrow.

"Hrm..?"* - Sun Nov  8 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Thank you, I'll be going now. I will see you all tomorrow. - Sun Nov  8 21:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) turns to face those who have arrived, crooking an eyebrow as she sighs.

"I don't suppose any of you would care to take over where he left off?" The woman- who is apparently almost entirely uninjured from that fight- inquires of them.* - Sun Nov  8 21:29:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) turns to smile at Paine and nods.

"Ah, Miss Paine. It's been a while, since our first meeting..." She muses idly, smiling gently at her. "If you'd like to fight, I'd be happy to. Maybe in a fight, some of that shyness will fade away?" She teases with a warm smile, brushing her flowing violet hair back.

It frames a beautiful- if uncannily pale- face.. and other than that, she wears flowing red robes of a truly elegant quality- though there are two slight rips in the back that show..

Suprisingly, only one of them shows a wound on her back despite the rips having clearly been made by a sword.* - Sun Nov  8 21:31:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) smiles placidly as she steps back, and inclines her head in a slight bow to her sparring partner- before drawing her blade in a fluid gesture from her hip, and holding it in a left handed grip.

"I'm ready when you are, then." She says placidly.* - Sun Nov  8 21:41:20 2015
