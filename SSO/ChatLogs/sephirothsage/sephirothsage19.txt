<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles- as she steps back... breaking the clash suddenly as her foe begins to shift to lever the blade- as her own shrinks back down to normal after that single slash, and she breaks the clash- leaping backwards in a sudden blur of speed as she adjusts her blade into the grip she started the fight with.

"...Heh.... smart thinking. Come on- show me more. You can do more than just defend, right?"* - Sun Nov 15 03:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles as her foe launches herself forwards. She takes a single step back to be slightly away from where she was expected- as her blade becomes a blur in the air. It arcs forwards- blurring forwards as the blade cuts through the air. As her foe plants her own sword down, the Nodachi's huge crescent arc is coming straight towards her as she avoids the ankle-sweep smoothly in the aftermath of her step back to deal with the Dynamic entry.

"Crescent Moon Beheading Slash." She says softly.* - Sun Nov 15 03:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as her foe ducks the blurring space of the Nodachi, and steps closer. She breathes in- then out.... As she shifts not to dodge the attack- but to take it to her shoulder. The blade crashes in- cutting through her dress, into her flesh. A splatter of blood...

And she grins... as her hands twist the blade in her hand as she brings it crashing back around while her foes blade is pressed against her shoulder. A reversed crescent moon- sweeping back through where her foe now stands as she slides her body to the side to barely dislodge the blade from her shoulder- grunting at the minor pain that just hit her.

"Not bad... an attack like that.. I just bled. Nice."* - Sun Nov 15 04:00:12 2015

"Yeah, I'm fine. It's just a little blood- I've had worse." She says simply- the slight cut from that huge blade still slowly trickling- but starting to stop already. 

"Heh... so. We done, or you wanna keep going?"* - Sun Nov 15 04:07:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) chuckles calmly and nods as she lowers into a basic stance. She nods as her foe draws a katana- as she holds her hands to the side and forms her own weapon out of Chakra- purple energy forming into her hands and elongating...

Into a gleaming Nodachi that she holds in a reverse grip, so as to hit her opponent with the blunt backside of the blade rather than the sharp fore-side. She breathes in, then out... as she twists the blade in her hands and assumes  a similar basic Kenjutsu stance with it..

Before she takes of- launching herself at her foe as she swings with her entire body into a diagonal strike- her blade's tip dragging briefly through the sand before flaring up towards her foes midsection from a low sweep- the blades increased length and width allowing her to have a certain degree of control the situation- the blades reach letting her be at less risk when making the sweep.

She's grinning.

"Show me your best dance, kid!" She says arrogantly as the blade comes sweeping in with her charge- a laugh on her lips.* - Sun Nov 15 05:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shifts to the side, flowing with her blade as she moves backwards. As her foe leaps back to avoid her initial strike, then leaps forwards to swing at her, she's already stepping back and rotating the blade in her hands to keep the flat facing her foe as she steps back- narrowly avoiding the blow towards her shoulder with a lazy smile- just barely, as the blade knicks her robe....

Before her blade becomes a blur. As she reverses her initial sweep- but quicker. Her blade forms a full crescent moon of motion through the air towards her foes body- this time aiming at the legs, due to how the child has moved.

The blow is restrained in force, just in case- but not in speed... as the blade whistles through the air in a crescent- blunt back still what is coming towards her body as she flows into the motions.

"Hey, not bad kid! You're pretty quick!"* - Sun Nov 15 05:32:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as their blades meet for a brief moment- steel ringing on her own purple blade for a moment, before she skids back afterwards- resuming her initial stance, but modified- holding her blade high at the shoulder, tilted to a stance optimal for thrusting, rather than slashing- as she plants her feet low and grins, half-crouching.

"Pretty good, kid- damn, but they just keep learning how to kill younger n' younger, huh..? Man.... well, you got more to show me, right..? Keep it comin, yeah?!" She says with a broad, energetic grin- clearly enjoying herself as she plants her feet into the ground, readying herself to move.* - Sun Nov 15 05:39:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins wide and nods.

"As you like it, little lady." She says calmly... as she thrusts her blade while lunging forwards- a full bodied thrust for her foes chest- a dead center attack as she starts to utilize her minimal sensory ability to simply feel her foes location- letting herself rely on that to trace her movements- trusting it more than her actual eyesight...

As her footwork shifts. She places her right foot forwards, and skids her left foot past that as the right foot stays stationary- the blade thrusting forwards towards her foe as she twists her entire body behind it- with a broad, happy grin.

"C'mon, let's keep on Dancin!"* - Sun Nov 15 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: mm... - Sun Nov 15 05:46:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) breathes in... as her blade halts for a moment at the full extension of the thrust... and she slides her right foot in a smooth arc across the sand to bring it around- another crescent begining to form as she moves to attempt to slice past the womans blade.

Her own weapon is, despite it's size, the quicker moving of the two- as it adjusts it's arc to go below the sweep of the flaming weapon as it accelerates into the crescent- as she turns the stab... into a slash; her hands adjusting as the diagonal downwards crescent lunges once more with the blunt side of the blade towards her foes lower torso.

"What a pretty dance, sword-play is.." She muses aloud as her body rotates with the blade to make completing the arc easier.* - Sun Nov 15 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins faintly as they seem to clash again- her own blade reverberating against the touch of her foes. She presses against it briefly... applying pressure and strain to the clash....bringing her body closer...

And then, as the clash reaches a high pitch...

Dismisses her blade entirely, as her hands part to form a pair of fists. She steps in as her foe is, presumably, left staggering from the sudden absence of any resisting force.. and brings in a savage right hook for her foes chin in the brief opening she just created by letting go of her sword entirely- the weapon fading into so much purple smoke on the wind as she does so with a broad ,eager grin- sliding in for the right hook, as her left hand winds back to her waist in preperation for something.

"SUPRISE!"* - Sun Nov 15 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) just keeps moving- as the flame leaps forth and impacts her gut... pushing into her... and doing nothing.

She doesn't even seem to slow down as the fist just keeps ramming out, and her left moves to grab the girls wrist on the hand holding the Katana- intent on pushing that out of the way and holding her to keep her in close- a grin on her lips as she looms in close range... the flame seeming to just run over her gut and leave no effect.

As she seems to not have actually noticed the restrained attack, and just kept  on going as if it didn't happen.* - Sun Nov 15 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts as the flame explodes- launching her backwards. She skids through the sand- the sand beneath where she was standing having turned to glass.

The explosion radiates around her body- the flame and smoke shrouding her. Her clothes are aflame- her body scorched...

And as the smoke clears... She's laughing. She's charging... and she's launching herself in for another blow- blade forming as she makes a normal enough sweep for her foes side- as the flame licks her body- the blade back in her hand as she brings the length of steel towards her foes shoulder with a wild grin- as she dashes out of where she was blown by the explosion- erupting from the smoke, honed in on her foe's chakra signature still.

"HAAAHAHHAAAAAAA!"* - Sun Nov 15 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: NOT AGAINNNN. - Sun Nov 15 06:20:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces, as her slash is avoided- her eyes fixated on her foes general torso area as the handseal is formed. The sand and flame seems to swirl about her- as she emerges from the haze...

Seeing Izanami only as a vauge distraction to the side- as her real foe walks in- chuckling softly as the sand blows about him. It's an indistinct, tall figure- with a lazy smile, and strong arms. He's laughing at her- his purple hair blowing in the wind, his violet eyes gleaming.

He speaks- the words are indistinct...

She's been frozen for a moment now... her clothes burning away, but her skin only really touched by the initial blast of flame as she breaks out of the momentary moment of confusion...

And screams. It's a primal, feral howl. An instinctive scream of rage as she starts to swing at the empty air near Izanami again and again and again- a berserk fury of fear and primal loathing overcoming her as she steps forwards- almost /ignoring/ Izanami entirely- almost moving to put herself between the little girl and the illusion of her long-gone father.

And she doesn't stop /screaming/ the entire time.* - Sun Nov 15 06:25:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) is, from the looks of things, fighting against an invisible opponent of some kind. To the outside looking in, she's flowing and moving as if fighting some kind of a duel against an impossible opponent- but it can't be that simple. That is primal, raw, hate and terror in her eyes.

She's just swinging at the air and parrying invisible strokes- as within her own mind, her father smiles lewdly at her and starts to advance. She remembers fully the details of why she fled her first one- and screams again and again as tears drip down her cheeks- a word mumuring beneath her tone.

"No.. nonononono... Not again.. GO AWAY!"* - Sun Nov 15 06:31:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) is panting raggedly as she continues to swing the blade- tears dripping down her cheeks and ragged sobs, as the blade soon fades away....

And then it all ends, and she drops to her knees- panting.

She realizes it was an illusion only after it's over.

".....Satan.. fucking.. damnit.." She rasps out, almost choking from the coughing fit she almost had. She draws herself up to sit down, and relax- breathing out as she hugs her knees.

"...Fuck that shit, you win. I'm done for now." She says softly- turning angry eyes towards Izanami. "Legitimately fuck that shit."* - Sun Nov 15 06:35:31 2015

"Yeah. I have several elemental affinities, but no elemental Jutsu. A Chakra flow, though? That strikes me as well worth making use of with my Kenjutsu." SHe explains, before pushing herself up and grunting- walking over to hold out a hand to shake.

"Regardless of any of that? Good fight, yo. I had a lotta fun, up until the end- you're a damn good opponent. Those Jutsu of yours sure pack a punch, too.. I usually don't get hurt by enemy attacks, hah! It's nice gettin to know you in a fight like that."* - Sun Nov 15 06:47:28 2015

"So, you're okay, little lady? Good, glad to hear it." She says calmly- smiling calmly as she starts to read the scroll she was given, humming calmly as she rolls out the scroll and studies the basic idea of the technique.

"So... Mrm. I don't really have anything I can teach you in return, either of you. My sword stuff is mostly related to a Kekkai Genkai of my family, so I can't teach other's how to manifest swords like I do."* - Sun Nov 15 07:20:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) meanwhile, raises her hands above her head... and charges in in the wake of the sand and dust- emerging from it a moment later.

She's not near as fast as her partner- but she's drastically faster than she was just a few days ago, as she bursts out of the sand- blade already formed in her hands as she leaps up- and as she is bringing the blade down in a two handed, overhead strike towards her foes shoulder...

The air whistles- as the blade expands mid swing- a spectral figure of a young boy pressing down against the steel as it swells and expands in every way- the blade suddenly coming down with an absolutely devastating force towards the mans shoulder- nothing held back as she moves to try and take advantage of the brief opening.

"TORIYAH!"* - Sun Nov 15 08:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grunts as her attack is parried and he evades- before it rends through the shield of sand- which has, thankfully, bought time for Tetsumi to dodge- as her blade parts the Iron Sand and crashes to the ground- seeming to sink into the sand of the Arena briefly- before the blade begins to shrink, as he responds..

With a brutal wind technique. The sand that it kicks up manages to grate against her body- and the sheer force and pressure of the wind manages to do something that most concentrated assaults she's faced in prior spars have had trouble doing.

She's bleeding, as she is forced back. As the wind lets up just slightly- she is already darting to the side. The Senbon are not fully avoided- but turned from likely pressure point strikes, into grazing blows to her legs as she rolls to the side out of the burst of wind after skidding back slightly, and throws herself for a thrust straight, head on into his shield- a gleam in her eyes as she pushes with one hand on the hilt- and the other hand on the base of the hilt, pushing the Nodachi forwards as she makes her counterattack- trying to pierce straight through the sand to at least nick him.

"HAAAAAHHAHHAAAA!" She cries- as blood flows from countless tiny gashes on her body- no serious damage anywhere, just.. lots of little cuts from tiny senbon, and highly quuick moving sand.* - Sun Nov 15 08:43:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces- as her initial thrust misses and he slides to the side...before she sweeps the monstrous Nodachi in a blur of chakra-enhanced speed towards his body- the edge seeming to actively chase him as it forms a crescent moon of movement- as she manages to take a single step more to push into that sudden, likely unexpectedly quick, strike...

Before the sand immobilizes her- slowing her down too much, too quickly.

"Godamnit... This is.. some real bullshit!"* - Sun Nov 15 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: If I can just get one hand on him... - Sun Nov 15 09:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) holds still in the Coffin- straining fruitlessly against it. Her muscles bulge- but she's just not strong enough- as her blade is frozen inside the second shield- stopped short... as it then flickers out of existence, fading into purple smoke in her hands.

She sighs wearily at that... staring at Jiki intensely as she is held immobile- staring at him with a gleam in her eyes.

"....You sure have some strong tricks." She admits softly.* - Sun Nov 15 09:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) tilts her head slowly- squinting as she feels a familiar chakra... and looks past Jiki.

She stares straight at Yan for a long moment.

"....YOU SON OF A BITCH!" She roars audibly- redoubling her efforst against the Iron Sand Coffin.

"YOU'RE ALIVE, YOU SON OF A FUCKING BITCH! AND ALREADY BACK I- YOU SHOULDA TOLD ME YOUR SWARMY ASS WAS ALIVE! I ALREADY MOURNED YOUR ASS, GODAMNIT!" She protests at his presence- glaring at him angrily.... before softening.

"Thank Satan, you're not dead."* - Sun Nov 15 09:27:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) shakes the last of the sand from her robe- eyes ablaze with some kind of... inner tsundere-power, as she steps to the side, conjures her sword- and directs that focused glare of feminine.... confused anger? towards Jiki, rather than the man responsible for it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grins as she's told to do stuff... flicking her blade of energy to the sand and staring at Jiki... a gleam in her eyes. She focuses briefly, and nods.... As she charges in- stepping forwards and leaping from the sand to make a smooth, relatively normal, upwards diagonal slash as her opener.

Compared to her techniques from last time... this is down right simple, by comparison- as she throws herself into the fray with a broad grin. It's a simple attack.. deceptively simple, as the blade arcs up with her normal force- a gleam in her eyes... as he might notice.

The side facing down, is the edged- the side she just slashed forwards with, the back. She's holding the blade reversed as she steps into the attack- eyes focused on him as she prepares her follow up.

If he's not careful- he'll find what her real intent was- as at the zenith of the upwards swing.... she reverses to bring it down suddenly... pumping energy into the blade to expand it.

Expanding it fully as a soul screams in torment from within as she calls upon it's power from the technique- Yuudai's tormented form pushing the blade down with sudden and abrupt force into Jiki's shoulder after the initial strike had fallen short.

It's a two step combination- and a brutally devastating one at that, if it lands.* - Sun Nov 15 09:50:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) grimaces as her blade in it's expanded state continues to crash down through the sand shield. The shield does have one benefit though- it slows the attack massively- layers of sand that it is cutting past managing to definitively slow the attack utterly down- as it pierces through one full layer...

Then hits another- as the wind bullets explode towards her body- and with him restraining their power, they are simply insuficient to deal with her- he'd need to use more force...

Because as they are, they simply break upon her body- poking holes in her robe as she presses the falling Nodachi forwards- trying to let what is left of it's force reach him as it shrinks slowly back down.

It's almost back to normal size- indeed, practically all the way down to normal... as she brings it the rest of the way down towards him as she steps forwards.

Down into a blurring crescent.

Meanwhile, each bullet lands into her body- and drills into it slowly. They dissapitate before they can do truly serious damage- her incredibly tough hide apparently especially resistant to Ninjutsu... but they do manage to deal damage equivalent to a solid punch on a normal persons body- forcing her away as she coughs and splutters- grimacing as she stares at him, now unarmed... and raises her fists.

"Yo, Kiyoko's got lives to save and surgery to do. Let her do whatever she's gotta do. Let's drink- pass the booze." She says calmly- a lax smile on her face- suprisingly calm for someone accused of murder.* - Sun Nov 15 10:55:47 2015
