<br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Wonder if I should speak with the geezer..Maybe i'm not that threatening...  - Fri Oct  9 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) || The old man jumped a bit at the mention of 4 people. He looked away from the group and spoke once again, "No, I have not.." he admitted to the boy as he began to walk back to his home inside of the small village.* - Fri Oct  9 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307)  ||4 individuals would speed out of th building running, one seemed to be hollding somethng, a basket of sorts that could be used to carry a human body in. They ran east away from the ninjas junting them down. 

One man, a large individual stayed behind, his voice was deep.* - Fri Oct  9 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) says: Ohoho, so little boy wants to battle me? - Fri Oct  9 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm.. Come for me if you dare... - Fri Oct  9 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) says: You got balls, i'll tell you that. - Fri Oct  9 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) took a deep breath and relaxed into his normal stance, he thought of every one of his limbs as a different weapon that he could use to his advantage. He was never without his weapons just like his leader had taught him. 

"Boy you will never be in my league, show me what you got!" he yelled waiting for the boy to come at him. His muscles defined even under his cloak.* - Fri Oct  9 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: thank you sanoke. - Fri Oct  9 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) 's counter attack would be an all out attack upon Koji right back at him. John would sweep back at the man with his own series of kicks and sweeps. He was just trying to drop the boy, it was a battle of the first one to give leeway tot he other would lose this battle and die. He had no intentions of giving his life for this caus just for their leader to profit. * - Fri Oct  9 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) felt the force of the technique hit him and was bounced back. "Hehehe, so you got cut skills huh?" he asked the boy as he ran foreward again, he pushed his body way past it's pain tolerance, he was able due to the medicine he was given. Once he moved in on the boy again he would cock back his fist and blast it foreward with extensive force, his punches doing nearly 40 damage and destroying the ground udnder Koji with ease.

* - Fri Oct  9 19:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: The force of the Gentle Fist is mininal as it targets the tenketsu but fused with the gates causes severe damage  to both. Truly a threat. - Fri Oct  9 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) 's attacks were strong and he was not the second strongest member for no reason. When he saw the boy's sudden burst of speed to jump over him he shifted his body while following through with his punch, the earth was no inhibitor to his body. He fist would simply travel thriugh the ground and come back out to hit Koji, he would have lost no strength with the attack, meaning he lost no speed. At most he planned on backing the boy up. 

"So now you're serious?" he asked him.* - Fri Oct  9 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) felt the skin on his fist being grinded to the muscle but he didn't bounce back too far, he was a big man and his body was dense. He smiled at the fact of what the boy was capable of. He sent powerful punches right at the boy, he was back in his standard muay thai stance now. Each punch was capable of dishing out 30-35 raw damage and would rattle the bones of even durable people. He wanted the boy to dodge and jump around, he loved it when the boy faught back, it just made the fight more fun for him. He was like some possesed demon as he faught not caring about even his own body.* - Fri Oct  9 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) attacks may have been dodged, but as a proffessional boxer he would not allow the boy to touch the arm he was punching with, if he really tried he would end up punched. This time when the boy spun he would be knocked back for sure, his arm bleeding once again but he still could not feel the pain. "You call yourself a fighter?"

John would get close again and begin following Koji's movements aiting for Koji to attack now. His movements were falling right in line with Koji's and as such his ability to dodge Koji's attacks would be increased a bit.* - Fri Oct  9 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) dodged the initial attack and moved his body in a way that only 1 or two tenketsu would be hit on his lungs, his arms would be too quick, he was a grappler, he would grapple Koji and throw him into the air setting him up for the most devastating blow he would ever feel.

Once the boy was in the air, he would shoot intot he air like a rocked and spin like a top spinnign windly and get blood everywhere, he had the endurance to keeep going on without losign a beat due to the pills and if he was successful he would slam his heel intot he boy's gut and hopefully 6 feet deep underground. The entire process would be quick and clean, somethign the boy couldn't just or rely on reflexes for.* - Fri Oct  9 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) 's attack was successful forcing the boy intot he earth. He could feel his body shaking as it was giving out on him. He looked back to see 2 moe individuals coming in. "More prey!" he yelled still unabl to feel any pain for the time being, he was sweating from the effort as he ran, his plan to punch a hole straight through Jiki's chest.* - Fri Oct  9 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) was punched back down and turned into mincemeat. He layed on the ground just inches away from Koji. "You werent half bad kid..." was all he would say in his foreign Konoha accent. He just layed there until he died, the pills effects wearing off.* - Fri Oct  9 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) ||Now that there is no Daimyo nearby, what will the adventurers do?* - Fri Oct  9 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I can't even rely on Koji's ability, he's done. - Fri Oct  9 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) 's genjutsu effects would activate on the again. It seemed Ezikiel had set this all up while they originally ran. The genjutsu would morph the world around them, the sky would go black, the clouds would dissapear and a powerful sandstorm would kick up. The only way for them to get out would seem to be one point on the horizon that seemed as though the sand didn't want to touch. Although they lost their sense of direction icly, they would be headed due west.* - Fri Oct  9 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Koji's down, Sanoke's spooked..Err..I hate this. - Fri Oct  9 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) ||Those walking towards Ezikiel's light, salvation, would continue walking until they reached an outpost, those who were with Yan would be stuck in the infinite sandstorm. The weather would seemingly never change, the sand storm would just continue getting stronger and stronger as if kicking them out. 

Those who came back tot he outpost would be greeted by the same old man. He was obviously angry and yelled at the two, "Get out of here, we don't have anything here for you!"* - Fri Oct  9 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) ||The old man ran for his life, he knew he was going to die now at this point, he wouldn't be able to hold off the Daimyo's saviours. 

The same man that had tipped the group off earlier was nailed to the wall of his own wooden house, it seemed his own kids ere un nailing him and his wife was cleaning up the blood, they were all shaking. Once the boys had finished un nailing the man a low ranking soldier grabbed him by the ankles and ran with him, "I won't let you bury this trash's body." he would say as he ran off dragging him disgracefully aross the ground.

If the old man was trapped by Jiki he would open his mouth and speak, telling the other to let the daimyo go. The daimyo had obviously been tortured, he was naked with severe injuries caused to his body.

A young man woud walk foreward, he spoke with bvious confidence in his voice, "Why do you want to save this man?" he would ask.* - Fri Oct  9 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) ||The young man folded his arms and spoke up, "This man has been terrorizing our village, he had been forcing us to leave and migrate to the captial. This man is an evil that you canno comprehend and none of us will give him up unless you kill us all, here and now." There was no faltering in his voice, just pure emotion, rage, an emotion that all of these shinobi had known by now. Pure Rage...

The Daimyo spoke up, "Boys, good work tracking me down, now kill these ungrateful fuckers!" he yelled, his voice full of fear and self preservation, if Jiki faltered for even a moment the Daimyo would speak up again, "Kill them, i'll garuntee you anything, Money, Fame, Power, you name it!!!"* - Fri Oct  9 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I really don't know Yan.. - Fri Oct  9 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: This is the first time..i've been stumped. - Fri Oct  9 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: If its a trick, I could actually be killing the damiyo. - Fri Oct  9 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We can call forces to detain these men. - Fri Oct  9 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We don't have to kill any of them...they can serve their time or be put to death by the government. - Fri Oct  9 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *sigh* - Fri Oct  9 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fact is, the scenario doesn't sit well with me. - Fri Oct  9 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) was deadly silent for a moment before speaking back up. He had to speak low because he only had one volume and that was screaming. "Kill me...Just do it...i'd rather be dead than leave my home, my parents, my culture, my wife and my people..." He looked up, his eyes red, a grown man was crying, it was his only outlet of rage. "Most importantly, I refuse to join the daimyo's guard...I absolutely refuse" All of those were consequences of leaving your outpost, the two boys would know that as well.

Meanwhile the Daimyo was in tears thanking Jiki for freeing him and now he was speaking once again, "Now boys, I want you to kill everyone here, they are all heathens, they have turned on their own country relying on terrorists and nearly killing me, do it and you will be rejoiced as heros of Sunagakure, and the Wind Country!" he was serious, but there was far less emotion in his voice, if anyone was good at reading people, they would only feel greed, and the need for survival eminating from this man, the exact opposite of the outpost's leader.* - Fri Oct  9 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) ||The leader would not allow the scurrying Daimyo to go. "I told you that you would have to kill me before I let this devil go anywhere." Just when you think he is alone in his endeavor his wife spoek up, "If you kill Jorge, you'll have to kill me too..."And me!" could be heard from each denizen 1 by 1 as they all chimed in, they were united.* - Fri Oct  9 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: This..is annoying. - Fri Oct  9 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) ||Their oppressor had gotten out successfully and the shinobi would be able to run, but that didn't mean the village would sit quietly. The leader would pull out a sharp blade and wipe it once over with a cloth, in one swift motion she would cut his stomach letting his insides out, and killing himself. Others would follow 1 by 1 in suit. 

They truely meant it when they said they would die before letting that man rule.* - Fri Oct  9 23:02:24 2015
