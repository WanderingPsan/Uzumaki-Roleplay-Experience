He had begun to tap the side of his head mulling several things over.  Baen may have had potentially reappeared near her, even so he had shouted out towards Asteroth.

"Hey!  Buy some bones off of him. Try to make your plank-like body attractive with a hair flip, and that thing I suggested earlier. Here's a hint, 'Uguu!~'!" he had been quite obvious in his tactics of seduction. These were a sure-fire way to net any man or woman.* - Sun Nov  1 08:50:20 2015

Floating as he made his way towards Asteroth, he had extended out his hands attempting to gab a hold of her before rising higher up. He had hopefully had been able to gain enough height to avoid the bones before the count had finished. Given the distance, and the lack of seals/incantation needed to perform the technique, along with his speed the odds may have been in his favor. Of course he hadn't decided to stay in the immediate area attempting to float off towards where there hadn't been any bone spires. It was clear that Asteroth hadn't been cutting back on those meals.* - Sun Nov  1 09:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had arrived onto the scene. Standing quite proudly as if he was about to do something, he then went into a hunched position acting as if he had been some older man. It seems he had noticed the two pillars that had been constructed within the sort timespan. Grumbling to himself, "Fuckin'...priests..." he could easily detect the holy energy coming from the barrier. Glancing over towards the other two, he had waited to see what they had planned on doing before he would make his move. Comically cheering them on while sticking to his assumed role, 

"Go get them youngsters!"* - Tue Nov  3 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He twitched while scurrying closer towards the barrier. He hadn't wanted to take the plunge inside just yet, rather he would have allowed Ichiro, and Mizumi to do their thing. Hopefully they would have been able to take out the pillars. Grumbles continued to emit from him as he cheered on from the sidelines, 

"Come on! You guys can do it! Put your backs into it!"* - Tue Nov  3 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His eyes lit up, watching as the barrier wavered he actually began to move. Mad-dashing through the barrier the holy radiation now being much more bearable than from before. He had headed straight for the priestesses. Channel a bit of energy into his hands he had released a coil of lightning like energy towards them hopefully weakening them, along with sending them to their knees. * - Tue Nov  3 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His eyes lit up, watching as the barrier wavered he actually began to move. Mad-dashing through the barrier the holy radiation now being much more bearable than from before. He had headed straight for the priestesses. Channeling a bit of energy into his hands he had released a coil of dark energy towards them hopefully weakening them, along with sending them to their knees. His attention had been fully focused on them rather than the necromancers. Allowing Ichiro, and Mizumi to handle them. Seething hate had gurgled from behind his mask while confronting his opponents.

"Give up, and maybe you'll be able to make good enough whores!"* - Tue Nov  3 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Once he had finished choking the last bit of life out of one of the priestesses. He had felt the shaking that came with the destruction of the tower. He already knew that Holy magic wasn't so potent towards shinobi in comparison to his state of being. Within a flash he had dropped the lifeless corpse, and summoned up a barrier, this time akin to that of a dome instead of a simple shield. Awaiting from the blinding light of pure energy to fade out revealing to them the plethora of corpses for him to collect later on. He took note, glancing around to see if his comrades were unharmed. * - Tue Nov  3 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Tue Nov  3 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Grumbled while looking around he had decided to head for the Nothern Building. This had been due to Mizumi already having jaguar sprinted for the Eastern without any sort of alert, or note. They truly did lack teamwork for the smaller things. The purple smog seemingly hadn't disturbed him whatsoever due to his barrier that he had still inplace. Having it move with him was a good investment. Not needing to worry about the sharpened weapons that had been waiting from up above he had continued onward potentially setting off more traps. He had actually kept his eyes on the ground below just incase any animal traps had been set attempting to ensnare his feet. This tactic may have made it easier for the rest of them to come once all of the traps had been activated or ignored.* - Tue Nov  3 07:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had awaited for his comrades to get their act together. The purple smoke most likely had been clearing by now allowing safe passage through. Of course 'safe' was subjective as long as they had paid attention to the environment. Ichiro, and Mizumi probably wouldn't have set off any other traps. The ever impatient Nigen had shouted towards them,

 "Hey come on! If you don't hurry I'm going in without you!"* - Tue Nov  3 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He shrugged it off seeing as his comrades had been twiddling their thumbs. He had to venture inside by his lonesome. Humming the common song that he'd normally sing. An abandoned building had been quite inviting to him. Expecting traps, he had been some-what shocked, "Not even a proper greeting?" he spoke sounding a bit disappointed. Making his way throughout the rooms, he had opened up multiple drawers to find hologram-based messages left behind by their target. The taunts hadn't necessarily rustled Nigen's jimmies, but he couldn't help but chuckle when thinking about how Asteroth may have reacted to hearing them.

His search had continued down towards the basement, he wanted to at least see if there were any leftover things he could swipe having assumed that the gem and their target had long been gone. Snooping around there had been obvious signs of experimentation going on. Archaic texts had been sprawled out among desks, and scrolls placed upon the floor without care. Glancing at the text on some of the documents they had been multiple theories on how to apply this 'gem' for specific outcomes. Further inspection of the desk revealed a hidden compartment within one of the drawers. Within it there had been a smaller box one used for keeping important possessions. A small lock had been placed on it. Of course this box had been quite interesting markings placed on it that would have otherwise been overlooked. Concentrating a bit of his energy he had sent a condensed bolt towards the lock attempting to melt it off. With success came a nice reveal. The gem that had supposedly had eluded them! Closing the small box, he had placed it within his robes for safety reasons. Making his way out of the basement and down the steps, he had regrouped with his comrades telling them the news so they could return back to the village.* - Tue Nov  3 08:19:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had surrounded himself within nature. The birds chirping, animals frollicking around the immediate area. Assuming a position more for meditation, he had began to concentrate focusing on allowing his bloodlust to flow out. Within a moment silence had befell the area. Everything was quiet as if there had been some sort of confusion amongst the animals.* - Thu Nov  5 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He knew what he had to do. If he had gained full control over his bloodlust, he could utilize it as a weapon to strike fear into the hearts of his opponent. Taking this information into account. He had begun to bring it out once more, causing all the animals to retreat in fear. Chuckling to himself he knew that he just had to tap into his own self to unlock his true potential.* - Thu Nov  5 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Why should he stop there? He would turn his hate and thirst into more. He would cripple people with just his presence. His breathing deepened, as he was taken on ride by his imagination. Chuckling at the thought of dehabilitating fear striking anyone who had opposed him. What ways could he torture people if he needed to?* - Thu Nov  5 21:41:45 2015

Without the need to stop he had been quite the force to be reckoned with. Chuckling to himself while also still training his bloodlust. His ability to manipulate his yearning to kill would be a pretty good weapon in his armory.* - Thu Nov  5 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Stumbling towards the village outskirts, he had no need to not walk through what would have probably been gates still in the process of reconstruction. He also hadn't need to show any papers, his presence was quite common for Konohagakure.* - Thu Nov  5 23:02:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Arriving quietly onto the scene. Looking at the sight infront of him, a smirk had been placed upon his face from behind his mask. With a snake of such stature he could almost taste the potential death tolls. For the time being he would just stay put, nothing wrong with observing.* - Thu Nov  5 23:36:06 2015
