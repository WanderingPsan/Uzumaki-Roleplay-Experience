<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Returning the removed senbon back into his pouch he had crouched down, scooping her up within his arms-bridal style. He hadn't normally treated someone with such respect, but this was a special case. His experiment was a success, the corruption of a human being had gone smoothly for the most part. Unless she had resisted he would have made his way back to Amegakure taking her to the nearest hospital to get her minor injuries patched up.

"You should be proud. You are an amazing fighter, and I hold you quite dearly to me now..~"* - Sat Nov 14 19:50:24 2015

He would then call for a nurse, of course his status was known in the village and it didn't take long for assistance to arrive. Within several minutes they had properly disinfected and bandaged Makoto's miniscule wounds.

Once the procedure had been finished, and the nurse's dismissal from the immediate area Nigen decided to speak up.

"For your beauty, and grace. I've decided to show a bit of myself to you.." he chuckled while his right hand clutched his mask. Slowly it began to rise being pulled off revealing his entire face.* - Sat Nov 14 19:56:22 2015

"I thank you for the compliement, even so what are you looking for? Eh..almost? I suppose I should take what I can get. Also, that isn't necessarily torture. I was rewarding you, if I don't reward the ones I love..how will they know that I love them?~"* - Sat Nov 14 20:03:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well you'll instantly be able to tell it is her once she tries to make you refer to her as "Queen". - Sat Nov 14 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Uh huh. - Sat Nov 14 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Do I refer to her as Queen? - Sat Nov 14 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She has blonde hair. I suppose you can make up a name for her, I tend to call her 'Fickle-chan'. - Sat Nov 14 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'd never call her "Queen". - Sat Nov 14 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You aren't her's. - Sat Nov 14 20:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Good, good. - Sat Nov 14 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I'll call her..... - Sat Nov 14 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Fickle-chan.~ - Sat Nov 14 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That'll definitely annoy her. - Sat Nov 14 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Should be fun! - Sat Nov 14 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had felt quite naked, deciding to once again place his mask back onto his face. His voice had begun to recalibrate due to the mask's voice changing properties.

"You are not to die out there. If they refuse to let you in simply come back, I'll retrieve your things.."* - Sat Nov 14 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Sure, sure. - Sat Nov 14 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: I'll keep that in mind!~ - Sat Nov 14 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Shiro(MadameShredder) says: Thank you, Nigen-sama.~ - Sat Nov 14 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Mhm. - Sat Nov 14 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Until we meet again. - Sat Nov 14 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) A pigeon had landed on his shoulder a note attached. It was an alert from one of his groups. The Rokubi had been sighted at Kirigakure. He had begun his move, sending messages to all of the squads to begin making their way for Kirigakure and staying put before entering into the fray. They would clearly need to be tactical about this. A delicate operation as this would undoubtedly have a great pay out. For the time being, He had needed to regain a portion of his energy, even if he reserves weren't out his need to prepare had taken over him.

"Heh..this is pure luck..!"* - Sat Nov 14 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had moved swiftly, bobbing and weaving throughout the trees. His destination wasn't far, but time was of the essence. Infact he could've used this as a chance to make Kirigakure even more indebted to him and his cause. The greatest part about it was he now had muscles and flesh, his body was faster. Being held back by simple bones were a thing of the past. He couldn't help but laugh.

Another bird had landed on his shoulder mid-sprint. Their men had been gathering just as he had made his movements. There wasn't any time to stop, and there hadn't been a need to. His endless stamina giving him a boost in comparison to others. A short amount of time had passed before he had reached land's edge. Signifying that Kirigakure was just on the other side. His men had been waiting. Taking command they had awaitied orders, 

"We shall begin our trek towards Kirigakure." his men had arrived they began their ascent levitation in sync as they hovered over the water.* - Sat Nov 14 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His men had traversed over the gate with ease. Landing their synchronized movements had proved that Nigen was given a group of proper warriors. They followed him, sprinting behind him. He would've never thought that he would be leading an armada of men into battle. 

"Sir..we should be finding it soon!"* - Sat Nov 14 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had stopped in his tracks, his right hand raised from his cloak and clenched signalling for his men to stop. It was clear that he had an army with him, but what for?

"Heiwa, where is the Mizukage?" there was urgency in his tone, something that Nigen often lacked.* - Sat Nov 14 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Tch.. - Sat Nov 14 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Useless.. - Sat Nov 14 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Shaking his head he moved on his men trailing behind him.* - Sat Nov 14 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Once again the rose up onto the village walls. He would soon hop down, commanding his men to stay along the edge. This would be the day that they would finally catch this white whale. His name was on the line, and that was something he didn't take very lightly.* - Sat Nov 14 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His men continued their march alongside the village's wall. Of course if it had been breached they would eventually jump off, landing safetly on the ground. With that Nigen had already been on the ground scouting out below. His head scanning from back and forth, his men pointed in the distance, 

"Sir..we may have contact!" a private had shouted. Nigen responded his trot had been filled with energy, determined to settle a score, but what was it?

(2 Turns till arrival or something.)* - Sat Nov 14 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He and his men had arrived on scene. It was easily confirmed to be the place of interest, the monstrous slug was an easy spot, along with the formed platoons of Kirigakure in response to the monster's appearance. His men stood ready to fight. He hadn't backed down walking forward he had shouted, 

"Where is the Mizukage?! I must speak with them now!" he may have been crazy, hoping to have a chat at such a crucial moment?* - Sat Nov 14 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Sat Nov 14 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What are these people doing? - Sat Nov 14 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Sat Nov 14 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Navigating through the crowd of shinobi, he had stepped forth towards the Rokubi. Calling out towards it, in hopes that it had remembered him from their last encounter.

"Beautiful! You're in pain, but do not worry..that will all be over quite soon!" yelling was pretty much the only way he could've hoped for the beast to hear him. All the while his men had been preparing an ominous chant that had reverberated due to the sheer amount of men that had been speaking in unison. He now only had to buy himself a bit more time.

"People of Kirigakure! This creature is innocent! It does not mean to threathen your livelihood! Allow my men and I to capture this monster. This isn't the first time I've done a service to Kirigakure, and hopefully it won't be the last!"* - Sat Nov 14 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The chant: 

"Eka aura yud'dha galati karata haie Eka nireayaka brasa eka dhokhadhaei ke upara hi suru kara dena cahi'ee Pratyeka sa'ueeaeraika eka darara vaiea ka virodha karata hai. Eka nice khulakara dhatu jama upara simita. Milana muhavara apane ekala eakkara nice adhyakea ka cunava karati. Eka santa pula ke bada ghaeaka bhuse murkhoe."* - Sat Nov 14 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inobu(Punka) thinks: What's...happening? - Sat Nov 14 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had watched as the Ryutaro had began to mess with his goal. His gaze sharpened, as he attention twas drawn to the strange beastial being. 

"Well this is definitely different..." he muttered. His hands clapped together, he had slowly pulled his hands away a condensed bolt bouncing between his palms before it had fully soldified into his staff. He hadn't needed to waste time with this.His left hand had signaled for half of his men to redirect their attention towards Ryutaro, yet the chanting hadn't stopped. Holding his staff in his right hand and raising it upward, he had began to conjure several spears of energy before speaking towards Ryutaro,

"Back away from my prey, I do not have time for your interference...." meanwhile his men had finished their chants. The curse had taken hold, in an attempt to paralyze the Rokubi completely. Even if Ryutaro hadn't paid attention he would've signaled for the other half of his men to unleash their curse upon him hopefully paralyzing the both of them until his business had been completed.* - Sat Nov 14 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) In all honesty he hadn't been paying attention, the gap had easily been closed. No attempts had been made to resist the binding that Ortho had placed upon him. The snakes wrapping around him quite tightly removing his ability to move. Sadly that hadn't been all for Nigen to deal with, as he turned to mutter "Slither-k--" he had been blasted by a torrential water dragon with an 'explosive bite' to say the least. This had most likely send him back, the force would have hopefully dispatched Ortho's snakes, but what would have happened to Nigen? His men looked in shock wondering if the downed man had been done for. Coughing up a bit of water he hadn't been dead yet, albeit shaken up to an extent. He had slowly rose back onto his feet, he beckoned for his staff, as it made it's way back towards him. 

"Really with this shit? After all I've done for Kirigakure, and I'm being blasted! You really know how to treat a guy, but I don't have time for blowing my load just yet. I have a deal to complete, and if you guys really want to be the ones held responsible for stopping that deal...well. I wouldn't want to be you guys when -they- find out.." his free left hand had went underneath his cloak. Channeling a minute amount of energy into his necklace he had sent the signal that would hopefully travel back to his contract dealers.* - Sat Nov 14 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Such a warm greeting.. - Sat Nov 14 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryu(Alekai8) thinks: Why the fuck did I come here, man I heard the rokubi was here and just couldnt resist.Goddamit. - Sat Nov 14 23:16:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What is it you're trying to collect? - Sat Nov 14 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So, tell your brother to stand down..I've done enough for Kirigakure. - Sat Nov 14 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: This beast! - Sat Nov 14 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..You're kidding. - Sat Nov 14 23:20:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I've helped rebuild Kirigakure. - Sat Nov 14 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is time that they return the favor! - Sat Nov 14 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Easy, Nigen.. - Sat Nov 14 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Easy? - Sat Nov 14 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I've been attacked by the people..I've helped.. - Sat Nov 14 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: There must be a midpoint here! - Sat Nov 14 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Work with me here.. - Sat Nov 14 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Not that..I mind that, but you are interrupting my hunt. - Sat Nov 14 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I am working with you. - Sat Nov 14 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Give me what I want..and I will be on my way. - Sat Nov 14 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Sighed, "That is fine, I will take it anyway.." his pitch had raised wanting to make sure his men had heard his command. "All of you focus your attacks on that other beast!" his voice had risen up multiple octaves akin to that of a high pitched squeal. If his men had understood the orders, and relayed the information their curse would have halted on the Rokubi restoring what was left of it's mobility hoping to aid in it's fight against absorption. Resuming their chant they had begun to focus solely on their target, Ryutaro.

With that done his gaze had bounced between Kana and Ortho,

"You are making a grave mistake. This will be seen as a betrayal on Kirigakure's part. Are you sure this is what you want, Slither-kun?"* - Sat Nov 14 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His men had completed their chant, focusing one hundred percent of their manpower solely upon Ryutaro hoping to force him to his knees, or hopefully weaken the amount at which he could suck. The sound of the aircrafts coming in had been a  "Godsend"(Badumtiss). His staff raised once again he channeled energy into the air before constructing multiple spears of dark energy. Keeping his word once again,  he had sent them towards the umbrella/dome-like structure Ortho had made, and not at Ryutaro directly. It was true his goal was solely the beast!

* - Sat Nov 14 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The torrential water tornado had been somewhat annoying, his men were able to handle themselves though. Some caught by the torrent and being thrown about, the rest had moved rerouting while still remaining in the immediate area. Another wall shot up from the ground, of course once again it had been Ortho impeding in his task. Luckily his spears hadn't been held back by the need for handseals or chants. Quickly he climbed up and clung to the newly created wall which was hopefully high enough to avoid Kana's waves. In a spider-man esque pose his staff had circled around in the air once more conjuring up another set of spears. His spears had been sent over and downward hoping to smash across the umbrella like dome once more. It was clear that he wanted to open up a hole large enough for them to airlift the Rokubi out.

"Heh, this wouldn't be fun if there wasn't something at stake now would it?" he couldn't help but laugh hysterically at the situation. How could such an annoyance be dismissed as a joke?* - Sun Nov 15 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Do not attack those aircrafts! - Sun Nov 15 00:10:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Look at this...all of this for one beast! Hahahaha!~ - Sun Nov 15 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? - Sun Nov 15 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His attention had been grabbed by Ortho's shout. He tilted his head as if he was an innocent child, 

Huh?"* - Sun Nov 15 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Why do you call for me?!~ - Sun Nov 15 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He wasn't about to let all of his hard work go to waste, still unaware the the Rokubi had been sealed due to the angle hat he was at. His focus was on Kana, summoing up another set of twenty spears he had sent them towards her hoping to push her off course if not stunning her for a bit.

"Slither-kun, you're not going to blame me for this..are you? I told you to back away, all I want is the beast. You refused to stand down, and now this is the outcome. You can try to blame me, but we both know who is at fault!"* - Sun Nov 15 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Slither-kun..you know I can't stop until..that slug is delivered.. - Sun Nov 15 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Slither-kun..can''t you see that this could have been avoided!? - Sun Nov 15 01:55:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: How was I supposed to know my brother was going to be carried off ? - Sun Nov 15 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: and a bunch of people either attacking the machine, or another ninja0 - Sun Nov 15 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had continued to observe sticking to the wall erected by Ortho. He was actually shocked by how long it lasted. Calling out towards Ortho, he had wanted his attention.

"Slither-kun, this is over! Tell your people to retreat, they're wasting energy now!"* - Sun Nov 15 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? - Sun Nov 15 02:28:03 2015

"Okay, men! Begin departure. Assist your wounded brethren! You were really good out there today!" his energy was off, why was he so happy?* - Sun Nov 15 02:40:00 2015

The Caravan would have made several stops to set up a small camp, but it was much quicker than walking on foot. The time it took to return had been about an hour or two. Once his men had hopped out of the carriage, Nigen's hand extended,
