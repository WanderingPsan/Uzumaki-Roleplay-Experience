<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Began his trek for Kirigakure. It was a long trek. It wasn't cool at all, but he had to do it. I mean come on, right? He had to move from time to time.

 The grass was green, the trees were too. He kept moving, not needing to stop the trek wasn't that bad. The trek was bad, because it was lonely. He didn't like loneliness especially when the birds were chirping. Sadness would befall him until he continued on his merry way.* - Fri Oct 16 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had made sure he had secured his item of covetedness it a safe place.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Strolled onto the scene, his tar black cloak undulating with the wind's gentle touch. He stood before said person, his face hidden behind a mask. Glancing around he muttered,

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Set his sights on the seemingly lonely rubble sitter. Nodding, he had remained quiet for a brief moment apparently thinking of what to say.

"Oh, yes! It seems Kirigakure isn't doing well. You have a hat similar to others I've seen in the past. I'm guessing you're the leader of this..vill-..land? If so, then I'd like to talk with you!"* - Fri Oct 16 02:34:52 2015
