<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Well I doubt there's a lot of use for it now. The person you gave the money too is likely dead. - Sat Nov  7 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: In addition, the bulk ofthe funds likely went to rebuilding the village itself. - Sat Nov  7 00:19:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Another Giant Snake? - Sat Nov  7 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Really? - Sat Nov  7 00:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I don't. You've proven inept in that regards already. - Sat Nov  7 00:34:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It's true you probably would've been dead if not for Mizumi.. - Sat Nov  7 00:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Then again it's your fault. - Sat Nov  7 00:35:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That boy, Index..knows not to attack me. - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I've met this.."Ortho" if you're referring to the man connected to that giant snake. - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And what type of trouble was she causing? - Sat Nov  7 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: All of this was in Kirigakure, by the by? - Sat Nov  7 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Yup. - Sat Nov  7 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: She was being rather aggressive towards the Mizukage and Ortho. - Sat Nov  7 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah. And back to the first question. -- Who is the Mizukage? - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I didn't catch a name. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Or he said it... - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I just don't remember it. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: An appearance will work too. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: the Mizukage robes... - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: and the blue hat. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Of course. Well, Nigen. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Go check for me. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hmph. - Sat Nov  7 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Tilted his head watching as Mizumi had placed his hand on his shoulder. What was this? Concern? Chuckling he'd dismiss it with a nod, 

"Sure..sure. I'm not worried about whatever is there."* - Sat Nov  7 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Shivered, there was something off about this. This level of compassion wasn't good for anyone. Shaking his head, he had rejected the offer, 

"No need, I'll be back soon. Plus, you're acting strange. I don't know what's going on with you, but you should really fix that.."* - Sat Nov  7 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: This bitch just got my name wrong....I thought we had something.... - Sat Nov  7 01:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Sat Nov  7 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: This could be a bomb. - Sat Nov  7 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Here..you hold it for me, Fickle-chan. - Sat Nov  7 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You're insane. - Sat Nov  7 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Blah..blah..blah. - Sat Nov  7 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Will you get out of here already? - Sat Nov  7 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Meh.. - Sat Nov  7 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You're rushing me.. - Sat Nov  7 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Tosses the ruby towards her, 

"Think fast!"* - Sat Nov  7 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He would then begin to stroll off.* - Sat Nov  7 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) It was an easy traversal towards Kirigakure. Kicking off he began to sprint for a few hours without end. The scenery looking quite familiar, he could easily spot where he had battled the Rokubi from before. The reports of his men find the Rokubi's trail was also fortunate.

Before long he had come up towards the body of water that was nothing new. Channeling a bit of energy into his feet he began to levitate, making his way across the water at a decent pace before finally landing next to Kirigakure's Gate.* - Sat Nov  7 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hey.. - Sat Nov  7 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Tch..dull.. - Sat Nov  7 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: So much for not being able to die. - Sat Nov  7 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Stumbled onto the scene his eyes bouncing around from person to person. The earth-based wall if it had still be erected may have garnered a bit of interest. Sadly it was hidden behind a mask; remaining quiet for the time being he had only wanted to observe.* - Sat Nov  7 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Sat Nov  7 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Ohoo?~ - Sat Nov  7 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Don't..laugh.. - Sat Nov  7 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) It seemed he has waited long enough. The bouncing of 'kind' words from the two that had seemingly been acquainted with one another to some extent had most likely ended. Slowly stepping forward his sandals clacking along the stone walkway with each gentle step. There was an internal struggle within himself, the succulent tears that were only so far away. The purest emotions hidden behind thinly veiled deadpan faces. Nigen couldn't have hoped to experience such beauty coming from a place that hasn't seen a respectable rebirth in quite some time.

Scratching the back of his head while he had seemingly been on a collision with Index,

"I understand how you feel. I-..It is truly a terrible thing. It's almost as if a part of you has been ripped away.." forcing back his need to laugh like a bad lunch that hadn't gone down well. 

"There are many things you can do from this point on, but what will you choose? Revenge for the dead? For someone that can't come back? Nothing wrong with being lost. Take your time, -murder- isn't an easy thing to get over.." his gaze bouncing back between Index and Ortho. He had actually been questioning both of them at the same instance. Doubting that he'd get much out of them at the time. Still it wouldn't be any fun unless he had given it a shot, imbeding thoughts into the lost was an enjoyable pastime.

"There's still time, who knows..maybe this world will change for the better? One death can lead to many other possibilities. Ripples upon ripples of routes! The only question is..'Who will make the first move from here on to cause that change?'"* - Sat Nov  7 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Sat Nov  7 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Think of how much murder there has been.. - Sat Nov  7 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I've seen a lot in my day as a priest.. - Sat Nov  7 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: This is only, the beginning. - Sat Nov  7 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: For some reason there has been a spike.. - Sat Nov  7 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Such a shame.. - Sat Nov  7 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Did I say something wrong? - Sat Nov  7 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I guess, "Kill and Dash" is a new thing.. - Sat Nov  7 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: To be looking for the Mizukage, yet find such an entertaining scene.. - Sat Nov  7 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: The priest? Great. - Sat Nov  7 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Such a sad turn of events.. - Sat Nov  7 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: WOE! - Sat Nov  7 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: . . .I swear I'm going to kill him one day. . . - Sat Nov  7 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Sat Nov  7 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I see..I'll be right with you.. - Sat Nov  7 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had decided to skip toward sthe spot that Ume had been disposed of. Chunks of her body still around. Crimson blood being sipped on by the dirt. Now was the perfect time for his tendencies to resurface. Unless he had been stopped; carrying on by crouching down and locating a piece of flesh and/or some blood. Placing it within a separate pouch with little care. He would've covered the rest of what was remaining with the dirt in the immediate area.* - Sat Nov  7 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Sat Nov  7 03:39:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Sat Nov  7 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Snickered, his sight placed upon the Mizukage.

"It seems things are going quite smoothly in Kirigakure. It is strange to hear tales that differ..."* - Sat Nov  7 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Don't worry, Mizukage-sama.~ - Sat Nov  7 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It didn't bother me too much, but I only came here to speak with you. - Sat Nov  7 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You see, I've gotten word that there has been a change in position. That the previous Mizukage has been replaced.. - Sat Nov  7 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I know he and I had a bit of an argument, but it's nice to see him. - Sat Nov  7 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: Yes, She passed a way. - Sat Nov  7 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: And no one took a hold. - Sat Nov  7 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I took it upon myself to assist the previous Mizukage, and Kirigakure.. - Sat Nov  7 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Sat Nov  7 03:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Funny, I never saw him around. - Sat Nov  7 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm. - Sat Nov  7 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: By trading two million of my own money. We agreed that in return I'd be supplied with consistent information. - Sat Nov  7 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Knowledge..I should say. - Sat Nov  7 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: And I assume you want to try and continue that deal? - Sat Nov  7 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Be it in Kirigakure's current status to a scroll containing arts. - Sat Nov  7 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Of course, the deal isn't over.~ - Sat Nov  7 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What happened to the previous Mizukage? - Sat Nov  7 03:55:05 2015

"There wasn't any real need for her to be disposed of. That's pretty off. I mean a kill is a kill.~" he chuckled dismissing the thought. Dwelling on it for too long may have been detrimental to his health. Amegakure wasn't far away, in fact from there to Kirigakure was quite close.
