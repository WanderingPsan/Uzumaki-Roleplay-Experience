<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His brow raised in interest, his right hand reaching out attempting to grab ahold of his wrist.

"I don't know why you would have taken on such a form.."* - Sat Dec 12 05:37:26 2015

"I see, well..you're definitely off."* - Sat Dec 12 05:43:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Shook his head, 

"You shouldn't be so willing to show your true form, Sado.."* - Sat Dec 12 05:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Cute, but I copied this from you. - Sat Dec 12 05:45:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: In amegakure and then now when I walked my fingers across your shoulder. - Sat Dec 12 05:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His hold on her wrist tightened, 

"I still don't know what you mean. I am simply, Osuda."* - Sat Dec 12 05:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I do expect you to refer to me as such. - Sat Dec 12 05:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Of course you wouldn't, because I am not Sado. - Sat Dec 12 05:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Now, Yuriko what would you like from me?~ - Sat Dec 12 05:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I just like your company, and if you are only Osuda... why are you still holding my wrist so tightly?~ - Sat Dec 12 05:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Because being compared to someone who I haven't had a nice time meeting isn't the happiest thing one would want. - Sat Dec 12 05:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His gaze had been placed on her the whole time he had been growing ever-so impatient. Or so he had wanted one to believe, his act had to be preserved. Eventually paper scouts had arrived on the scene grabbing his attention. They seemed to be directing him somewhere. Immediately release her hand, and distancing himself.

"I'd like to forget this conversation. I am me." he had waited a moment for any response before making his way off with the scouts.* - Sat Dec 12 05:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: What could they want..? - Sat Dec 12 05:54:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He arrived on the scene because he was sick and tired of waiting for the 18+ Rounds to end. Stalling wasn't about to happen. He had made his way towards the area. A loud boom ringing out had caused his mouth to drop. *NANI!?* was all that he could think. His act was perfect, in reality Nigen didn't care about any of the damage.

"A-..all of the innocent civillains..." he continued forward before a spiralling vortex of water had blasted out from the side. He couldn't believe what he had been seeing. Was there anyone that could really cause such destruction in the village. His village. His switch had been flipped, his curiousity was clearly being grabbed violently. As the dust settled, a crater being left in the wake of Kana's initial attack it was clear that whatever had did this was not of normal nature. Proceeding onward, he had made his way towards the fight that had just been initiated between Kana and the Anbu Agent.

*This is it...!~ This is the cause of the destruction!~* his mind began to dance around almost as if he had been some sort of child.* - Sat Dec 12 07:10:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: Well..if anything, you can still be difficult like a human. - Sat Dec 12 07:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: Perhaps if you stopped worrying about little ol meeeee, you could enjoy the bloodshed better?~ - Sat Dec 12 07:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: I wouldn't enjoy this.. - Sat Dec 12 07:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: You are a shinobi...all shinobi's enjoy bloodshed, whether the dream it or live it. - Sat Dec 12 07:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The wait had been killing him. Drawing blood from biting down on his lip, he had to move. Sprinting into action it was as if he had a death wish. There had to be some way to end this senseless violence. He hadn't been the slowest of people, but in comparison to a hyped up beast. His movements were pretty sluggish. Closing the gap between them quite quickly he had sprung upward, his body stabilizing itself as he seemingly took 'flight'. His voice had called out towards the two beasts, 

"Hey! Stop that right now!" sounding more like an angry pet owner rather than a jounin of a village. What else was he to say? His demanding tone was clear, and if they had any bit of reason, and attention left they may have been able to take note.* - Sat Dec 12 08:04:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) whispers: ...I suppose I could help you. - Sat Dec 12 08:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His focus had been on the two jinchuriki fightng ever-so intensely. Watching as Kana had continued to propel herself through the air, his eyes widened as her focus had been directed towards them. Before he could even get out the words to alert her, a torrent of concentrated water had came raining down. Attempting to utilize shunshin to avoid the attack by throwing himself northward, it had been too late for him to properly assist Yuriko. If he had avoided it, his sight shifted back towards his previous location.

*Is she dead...?* the thought trailed in his mind before being dismissed, and his attention refocusing.

"What the hell..why are they even here..?" he could only question the events still not knowing the full reasoning behind the actions of the two.* - Sat Dec 12 08:58:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Eh.. - Sun Dec 13 03:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Trudged past the flaps to the ramen shop, he had immediately signaled towards the chef. The recent events had been a bit much even for him, of course it had been the talk of the town. Plopping down on a stool, the chef had started preparing his meal, 

"Hey, so how's that stuff with the Western side of village? What happened?!" the Chef had really wanted the scoop. Nigen had easily deflected the question with a lethargic hand wave, 

"Come on, there's nothing I can really say about it. The reports were that it was a natural disaster. That's what it was.."* - Sun Dec 13 03:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: *Q_Q) - Sun Dec 13 03:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) It had only taken a few minutes before his bowl of hot noodles had been placed on the counter. The Chef's smile was filled with confidence, clearly inviting him to enjoy his meal at any moment. Smirking back warmly, he quickly reached for a pair of chopsticks. Breaking them apart unevenly, and beginning  to dig in, it seemed as if he hadn't wasted any time. Eating as if he hadn't had a meal in ages, it was as if he had never been taught proper table manners. Glancing over towards Kanari while slurping up some noodles, he spoke with his mouth somewhat full, 

"Hey..*chew* aren't you goin' to order somethin'?"* - Sun Dec 13 03:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Continued to enjoy his meal, slurping up some more noodles while observing her actions. It was true that he hadn't known everyone in the village, infact he had only really made an effort to remember two maybe three people at best. After he had swallowed another portion of his meal, he decided to speak once again.

"You know, you could just say what it is.."* - Sun Dec 13 03:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Looked a bit shocked, studying her outwardly he could see that she wasn't that young. Something hadn't been quite right, but he decided to just make a mental note of it. 

"Ah, don't worry. You'll learn to in due time.~"* - Sun Dec 13 03:34:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) says: I own a flower shop--well recently managed to buy one, prices sort of ....dropped with how the west side of Konoha got destroyed. - Sun Dec 13 03:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) says: So I bought one of the destroyed buildings that were still pretty much intact and did some fixes. - Sun Dec 13 03:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hato, Kanari(TenaciousRiven) says: Never could afford one before. - Sun Dec 13 03:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yeah, they'll eventually be fixed. - Sun Dec 13 03:42:40 2015
