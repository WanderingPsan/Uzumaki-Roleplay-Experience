<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Seemingly the ninja had disappeared. Carrying on he had wanted to head to Sunagakure without delay. He began sprinting quicker and quicker. He wouldn't want to delay. Making a quick stop for his possessions, he dug them up before carrying on.

He had noticed the scenery beginning to change. This had signified that he had been getting close to Sunagakure. Without any need for delay he continued onward. Chuckling to himself as he could almost taste the crazy antics that Sunagakure had deeply rooted in them.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had been making his way through the harsh deserts of the Wind Country. Feeling as if he had been close enough from a previous journey here. He had decided to bury his possession before covering it up with sand. The natural environment of the desert would cover his tracks after a few minutes. 

With that he'd keep on going, Sunagakure could be seen just in the distance. It was his time to shine.* - Sat Oct 24 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Of course the guards would have stopped him. Within a flash he had shown his "Travel Papers" not needing anything else.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) To his dismay the Sunagakure guards were somewhat competent. Refusing his papers that were seemingly written in crayon with further inspection. The present guard's eye twitched before shaking his head in denial. 

"You'll need to go back from which you came. You can't get in with that." their tone had been quite firm.

Grumbling to himself Nigen hadn't been inspected like this in so long. It was if this had been a whole new world.

"Fine, I request to speak with the leader of this place!" his right index finger shot into the sky as his began to wiggle his arm while making his demand.
The guard sighed before signalling over to another idle guard to go make contact with Hassan about the matter.* - Sat Oct 24 20:50:33 2015

It was lonely making the trekk back to Amegakure, but eventually his work would've paid off.* - Sat Oct 24 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The grassy scenery had once more appeared. This meant that he had been closer to home.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Scratching the back of his head as he watched her speak on about how great her summons had been. His interest had been piqued to some extent, awaiting for her sowing to bear fruit. Several minutes had passed by, taking note of her incantations they had been vague but not so distant that he couldn't understand some of the demonic babble that had emitted from her throat.
Once she had finished a surprising hole had been forced open from what seemed to be bottomless, the other side unable to be seen from this point of view. A cloud of energy being spat out before it had revealed a sizable jar with a grin. 

"I suppose you did say they were low leveled..." he muttered while trying to hold back a bit a laughter.

Shouting he had wanted the attention of each person within their abode. His mask acting as a loud speaker, he'd begin to announce..

*People of the Fourth District..you have exactly one week to remove yourselves from your houses. You are all being evicted. If you are not gone by that fair amount of time, you will be removed by force. Things may happen to you that are even worse.
