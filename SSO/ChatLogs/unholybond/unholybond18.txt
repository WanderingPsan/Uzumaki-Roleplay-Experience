<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Nina(Ninasky115) says: So if you won't start, I'm leaving. - Mon Nov  9 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He began to move, at first it was just a lethargic stride. Each step had taken him closer. Faster, and faster, picking up the pace his brisk walk had turned into a skip. One more step...had turned it into a sprint. He had hoped to close the gap between them. While her back had been turned he had arched over her, hopefully unnoticed. Looking down at the girl, the light from his eye holes had eclipsed. He hadn't been satisfied, after-all she had wasted his time if her threats were empty. 

"Come now, Nina-kun...~" he attempted to whisper into her ear. Of course this coupled with the lack of sound produced from his feet may have made him appear to be more than just a joke.* - Mon Nov  9 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Cupping his chin with his right hand he had begun stroking it while mulling several topics over. His eyes had began to scan her from top to bottom. He couldn't help, but chuckle.

"You tend to put your hand on the hilt of that blade a lot, but just how good are you with a sword? Did Ortho-kun train you? Maybe it was someone else from Kirigakure?"* - Mon Nov  9 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He couldn't risk being cut by a blade. What hapens if he bled out? Using his reflexes, and speed he had back pedaled. His right hand had been removed from his chin, his index finger pointed towards but his whole arm hadn't been extended out all the way. With a minute amount of concentration he had let out a small bolt of energy, hopefully hitting the mark! Of course if the bolt had made contact she may have felt a tingle of emotion welling up from within.* - Mon Nov  9 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) It had been quite surprisingly that she had ignored his bolt that had been heading straight for her. He had decided not to dodge this time, instead standing his ground. His cloak beginning to undulate from the winds that had been hurled towards him. If anything he had hoped to withstand the blunt attack. He would have hoped to solidify just how hopeless this bout was when his bolt may have hit it's mark.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond)  It had been quite surprisingly that she had ignored his bolt that had been heading straight for her. He had decided not to dodge this time, instead standing his ground. His cloak beginning to undulate from the winds that had been hurled towards him. If anything he had hoped to withstand the blunt attack. He would have hoped to solidify just how hopeless this bout was while returning fire with another quick bolt of dark energy.* - Mon Nov  9 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) All the while he had been chuckling, the proof that her ninjutsu had been lacking was potentially due to her youth. Observing as she darted towards him, hands clenched. *She couldn't be thinking of using taijutsu against me...* he thought to himself. "Come now, Nina. There has to be more hate inside of you. Where are those threats? The fact that you're alone. Only being able to rely on your own power. Your brother can not save you...-- his sentence interrupted by a swift right jab. Causing him to swiftly swat it to the side, there had been a slight delay. He punches had been some-what faster than his, but his reflexes had made up for the small delay. 

"Nina, are you ready to call me, 'Sado-Sama'?" he continued to poke at her hopefully agitating her a bit more.* - Mon Nov  9 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Shook his head, he could feel her on the edge of giving up. His bolts of energy weren't even needed to chip the spirit of a child. In-fact he may have went overboard on his part. Tilting his head to the side while watching as she pivoted on her heels attempting to end the spar by walking off.

"Nina-kun, you haven't held up to your end up the bargain. You must call me, 'Sado-sama'. You went into the spar, and threatened my life. You should have a punishment, right? Where is your honor?~" he had gained satisfaction in picking on her to some extent.* - Mon Nov  9 04:41:10 2015

Judging by her lack of skill in most areas, he could easily assume that she hadn't been too well trained shunshin. Well not enough that would allow her to make multiple jumps in a short period of time. Like a true stalker, he had navigated through the trees, this mainly had been due to the fact that shunshin allowed a person to travel only in a straight line, coupled with the fact that the jutsu was quite taxing. 


*She hasn't rested from our spar...* he thought to himself.* - Mon Nov  9 04:54:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His right hand extended outward pointing towards her, while his left had been clutching his stomach. Laughter filling the area, clearly he had been fully amused by her reaction. 

"Hahahaha! Y-..you're so pathetic! You should just give up already. You're never going to have a body like Owari-chan.~ Even Ichiro and Mizumi don't wanna hang around you!~"* - Tue Nov 10 05:26:49 2015

"S-..such an old jealous hag! Who would want to have a relationship with you?! Imagine what the kids would be like! I-..If you can even have children with such an old body!"* - Tue Nov 10 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Had wiped a 'tear' from his mask, his laughter calming down as he felt his hold on her loosening up. Of course that wouldn't have stopped him from continuing to poke at her, 

"You know you're right, you have someone that's inferior when it comes to figure. When compared to them, you shine pretty brightly.~" he had sounded quite sincere..* - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Smacked the staff away with lethargy, 

"I was just going to say that you could beat Nina-chan when it came to figure. Maybe not face, since you're old. Children are disgusting, though. So you're not really that high up!" needless to say a rain of laughter had came in succession.* - Tue Nov 10 05:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had continued to gloss over the incantations. Wanting to get the most out of the scroll.The incantations would begin to fly from his lips. "

Yaha meri iccha hai haima purvavata kare?!" He repeated over, and over before a spark of dark energy had erupted. Still there had been much need to improve.* - Tue Nov 10 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He continued to mutter, Mai? isa desa ke saitano? ke satha nr?tya karane ke li'e pyara karata hum?. Yaha meri iccha hai haima purvavata kare?!Mai? isa desa ke saitano? ke satha nr?tya karane ke li'e pyara karata hum?. Yaha meri iccha hai haima purvavata kare?!" chanting them with a bit of passion. He had been slipping up a bit on the first part, but that was fine. Eventually he would've been able to recite them without problem.* - Tue Nov 10 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He couldn't have been any more determined. Reciting the same lines over, and over before he could move onto the next set. 

"Mai? isa desa ke saitano? ke satha nr?tya karane ke li'e pyara karata hum?. Yaha meri iccha hai haima purvavata kare?!" Still he had stumbled over a few words. After all incantations weren't the easiest of things to remember, or to say. Even with that he had still pushed forward!* - Tue Nov 10 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) "Mai? isa desa ke saitano? ke satha nr?tya karane ke li'e pyara karata hum?.

Yaha meri iccha hai haima purvavata kare?!Mai? isa desa ke saitano? ke satha nr?tya karane ke li'e pyara karata hum?. Yaha meri iccha hai haima purvavata kare?!" his frustration grew with each utterance of the phrase. How could anyone be forced to learn such a spell at this time. Why should anyone be forced to deal with the difficulties of incantations. Incantations were potentially the bane of any spellslinger. Eventually he'd have no choice, but to move on with the rest of the incantation.* - Tue Nov 10 22:18:52 2015
