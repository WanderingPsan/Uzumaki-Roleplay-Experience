<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He'd begin his travels, making his way towards Kirigakure. It had indeed been a while since he checked up on his business. It most likely had been condemn especially if there had been a new Mizukage. He hadn't had a license check in quite a while.

Eventually the time would come where he would see the horizon of Kirigakure. A benefit of never tiring out is the fact that he could keep running, or walking for quite a while.* - Sat Sep 12 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The continuing trekk had left him wondering if time was simply slowing down, or if he had been losing a sense of time. It had caused him to mull over it for quite some time. People would begin to die, and return the ground as he simply continued to exist onward. It was a sad reality, but he didn't care so much about that. It had lead him to another train of thought. "What happens if all the books begin to decay from time? I'll be left without knowledge..!" his fear began to strike him hard.

Lost in his thoughts he hadn't realized that he had already reached a point where he needed to tend to something else. Stopping, he'd look for the perfect spot before burying his box. Covering it up quite nicely, before putting grass ontop it. Of course it was near a tree which had been less conspicuous.* - Sat Sep 12 21:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Begins to dig up his pendant. He'd begin to take off leaving no time for anything else. He seemed to be heading westward. So much for heading towards Kirigakure. Having noticed their fortified defenses he'd rather not deal with that nonsense just yet.

Making his way back would have been bothersome for a mortal. Luckily he didn't have such a problem. Walking hadn't seemed to take a toll on his body at all. It was just a means to an end.* - Sat Sep 12 21:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The walk had been quite easy for him. Continuing down the path his travels had lead him to some familiar areas. There had only been so many times one could walk down the same path, and not start to form makeshift landmarks. For some reason, Nigen felt at peace when dealing with nature. It was one of the things he had hoped to actually preserve. 

He kept on going, towards a proper spot for his pendant box. Burying it next to said tree, and covering it up. He'd begin to pat it down, before covering it up with grass to make it blend in quite well. With that done, he'd begin to head into the village.* - Sat Sep 12 23:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Didn't take notice of a single bird because birds are quite common in Konoha.* - Sun Sep 13 00:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) What the Shadow Realm did you just fucking say about me, you little low level duelist? I'll have you know I graduated top of Obelisk Blue in Dueling Academy, and I've been involved in numerous secret duels in Battle City, and I have over 300 confirmed Blue-Eyes White Dragons.* - Tue Sep 15 16:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) "Okay, then." he said aloud, "My plan for training was this. We train our Katon element along with my ability to levitate to the height of it's potential by learning a new jutsu, but not just any new jutsu. I want to create an ultimate Katon technique, so powerful that it could obliterate a city on it's own." Ushinawa's ears perked up during the last part of that sentence as he wondered why Nigen would want such a powerful technique. He'd already shown his willingness to kill; He meditated on Nigen's psychological incapability to feel guilt, before thinking:

Honestly, I don't trust you with something so strong. Nigen frowned, deepening the serious countenance that always was pressed into his face. He was not offended, only disappointed that Ushinawa didn't trust him. The trust wasn't earned, so he couldn't really be too offended, but he still didn't feel guilt or remorse. "I'm not doing this to actually destroy anything. I want to become a better ninja, a ninja worthy of becoming a Kage, or something more. Part of being a Kage is having the strength to protect those you love, and the village you shadow. Luckily we don't have to deal with either of those." Ushinawa begrudgingly nodded, and sat back for a moment. He nodded as a way to tell Nigen he would help.

A whole new type of jutsu. One that changes our very beings, changing our bodies into weapons. This way, it will transcend other jutsu, it will be like slipping into the skin of a god for a moment. Or, a more fitting description would be falling into a Stygian form. Ushinawa nodded, and questioned, and how are we going to do that? Nigen didn't answer, just decided to demonstrate instead.

He charged quick burst of Katon chakra into the palm of his right hand, causing a quick combustion whose light refracted from the silver bracelet that held which hung from his wrist. It cast a brilliant red glow, only for a moment, before fading away. That was from one fast burst of chakra. He then demonstrated maintaining a flame with chakra, something they did when creating fireball techniques and similar jutsu; it lasted until interrupted, due to the constant flow of chakra practically "fueling" the flame. Nigen passed his opposite hand through the flame, extinguishing it completely as the chakra flow was disrupted. Now, he closed his fist, charging power, and when he opened it again, another flame was there, burning stagnantly in mid-air. This one's shape was different; more wispy, like red smoke; but at the same time, there was a round core of flames that burned a solid orange-whitish color. He attempted to pass his hand through it, and it hit the core, with no further movement. He forced his hand into it harder to demonstrate the flames solid density, and his skin sizzled.

You see, when I solidify the fire, the chakra flow can't be interrupted, giving it more uses than before. The only problem is that it uses plenty of chakra to keep it solid like this, and water can still extinguish it.

Ushinawa nodded, surprised that Nigen had been studying chakra flow so well. He was a studious ninja, indeed, even more so than he let on. Well, technically they were the same person, but that was aside from the subject; Nigen's emotions and thoughts were independent from Ushinawa's. 

Ushinawa nodded, and held out his own hand. Now, how do I do that?

 Simply enough. Okay, to solidify the fire, just compress a lot of chakra into the center, and the smoke and charcoal being forced into the core will give it an essentially solid form. Ushinawa followed the instructions. He focused his best, and the fireball in his hand bent and melded into a few different shapes. It wasn't forming a core, however; and Ushinawa definitely felt the tug on his chakra supply. Nigen watched, calm and patient, while he released the chakra flow in his own flame, turning it into a poof of smoke that faded away.

Nigen's flame was a brilliant red color, but as it compressed and grew smaller, it burned brighter and the shades of red changed; from a deep, almost brown fire, lighter and lighter, to orange and yellow and stripes of red surrounding. The contrast between the hue of his eyes and the hue of the flames grew stronger, until the flame was a similar tint to that of Nigen's. The warmth caressed his hand like a glove, but it wasn't like a burning warmth. Whenever they used Katon jutsu, the flames seemed to be passive, almost embracing their body rather than fighting it. It was pleasant, nearly. Nigen reached out and touched the core of Ushinawa's fire, and it singed his finger. A red burn appeared within seconds; but when he pressed his finger against it, it was dense and solid to the core. He nodded in approval.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Now, how are we going to use this to our advantage, much less make a high rankingtechnique out of it? Nigen almost laughed at that comment. Solid fire was definitely something worth using; it added a whole new dimension of techniques to the possibilities of Katon ninjutsu. It almost confounded Nigen that Ushinawa couldn't see this for himself. Don't you see? We could create a sustainable armor made of fire, which is exactly what I had in mind. Well, not really armor, per se, but rather a coating of flames that could boost our skills to another level.

Ushinawa spawned a confused expression, most likely by the use of the words "coating" and how that could boost skills. Nigen read this expression, and clarified briefly. We could make wings, firstly, to allow for limited levitation capabilities. We could make it work defensively by burning anyone who touches us. It could increase our speed if we utilize the fire and chakra. Et cetera, et cetera. Ushinawa smiled, thinking of the possibilities. Nigen was having some definite bright ideas.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Making his way towards Kumo. The trek may have been quite exhausting for someone else. Luckily, Nigen didn't have such a problem. He'd continue on his path stops were not needed. Luckily there were pieces of scenery that he hadn't witnessed before. Sight-seeing was an enjoyable pastime, after all what else would he do besides watch the time go. 

Eventually his travels would lead him towards outskirts of Kumogakure. Stopping short, he had prepared a spot for his vessel it had to be a good distance away. Digging up some of the more arid ground, he had placed his vessel below. Covering it up, he had patted down the gravel making sure that it was properly hidden before continuing on with his trek into Kumo.* - Tue Sep 29 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Digging up his valuables. He would begin to retrace his steps. Heading away from Kumo, his trek was seemingly caused him to have a change of heart. The arid Kumogakure. He hadn't want to deal with it's natives. It had been time to return back to a more familiar place. His red eyes had been plastered on the general direction of his location. Slowly, but surely his steps had brought him closer to his goal.

The travel was more boring than usual. Having already passed by this scenery once before. Kumogakure's land wasn't the most exciting. There was a lack of life. Something that had gave Nigen a sense of similarity. Even with that he had always had a softer spot for nature. He wasn't a complete psychopath. With Konohagakure on the horizon. The scenery had already began to change, the distance between them wasn't so far. 

Making his way towards a suitable area, he had begun to dig up a bit of dirt. Making a spot to place his valuables before covering it up. Placing dirt upon it, and laying out a bit of leaves to make it look more natural. He had planned on no one being able to spot out his hiding spots.* - Fri Oct  2 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Looking back at his training from when he was younger.

Nigen was from a family that dedicated a great deal of time to training bojutsu, and magic, so he was already highly skilled in the art form. Nigen's goals over the next few days were to brush on the fundamentals that he has been overlooking as of late. Discipline was a necessity for a mage. After digesting the small details that were likely to make all the difference in a battle he would apply what he learned to begin contemplating new techniques. But what Nigen was really looking forward to this week was the last day of training. He would have a very special teacher come down to visit him to help him train more vital skills as well as what type of mentality a mage must have. This visitor was Nigen's father .

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The new initiate hadn't seen his father or his family since his graduation. He was looking forward to working with him; Even though they have clashed frequently in the past due to Nigen's lack of obedience. But Nigen was prepared to comply completely with his father's advice. It was going to take every fiber of his being to do so.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Nigen's father was only a little bit taller than Nigen. He also had red hair, but his was short and wavy as opposed to spiky. Nigen's father despite being in his fifties was an extremely fit man. He had a solid abdomen as well as imposing biceps and triceps; he was also rather quick. His speed however, was a little hindered by a bad knee though. Nigen's Father's personality was strict and by the book.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) But if there was anything Nigen's Father cared more about than tradition, it was family. That is the main reason Nigen's Father, despite not totally understanding or condoning Nigen's decision to be a shinobi, has supported him none the less. Now, that doesn't mean Nigen's Father doesn't pry and probe at his son to choose otherwise, but at the end of the day he is there for him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The time had come for Nigen to truly train. It seemed like every time the eager mage initiate set aside to train his Bojutsu, and magic, his plans would be derailed by a sudden mission or some other unexpected occurrence that he would be required to attend to. He considered going to the Shizan Dojo but it was a decent while away and Nigen didn't want to take the chance of something stealing him from his training on the way there. Therefore, he decided to train in the general area of the village. He chose a spot about 100 meters from his apartment; this particular spot seemed to always get a significant amount more sunlight than any other area within the general area. * - Fri Oct  2 04:31:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) It was adjacent to the weapon shop. This spot was perfect for training, mostly flat with a few undulations that would be useful as launch pads for aerial attacks. Nigen carried a wooden dummy that he kept in his apartment, and his backpack that contained other training essential. "Yes, this is it; I'm going to finally train." Nigen said rather emotionally as he stepped outside his apartment with his wooden training dummy propped on his shoulder. "I made, I actually made it!!" Nigen said excitedly as he arrived to the spot he had chosen for training. 
He stumbled across this somewhat unusual training ground during one of his D-rank missions. The young mage wasted little time as he quickly set up his training station. He would be utilizing a 30 meter radius for his training, and he marked the area off as such. The wooden dummy would indicate the center. Nigen was very meticulous and liked things to have a set order, this was extremely important to him so it's no surprise to see him going to such lengths in preparation.
Nigen was always working on new or already existing techniques; his latest most desired technique was still in the developmental stages. There were a few fundamental components of his skill set that were in need of honing before he would be ready to take on his new technique fully. The key component to his new bojutsu, and magic maneuver was the thrust,and then finishing up with the most devastating portion of the technique-a magical blast. His staff was about 48 inches in length (1.5meters); Nigen positioned himself 36 inches away from the dummy. He had his left foot forward and both knees slightly bent. 
Both of Nigen's hand wrapped around the handle of the lethal weapon, he twisted his body bringing his right elbow back; the elbow would act as the driving force for most of the power the strike would inflict. After he cocked his elbow, he uncoiled his torso firing both his arms forward; both fully extend to penetrate the wooden dummy. The determined mage would repeat this simple and short process over and over again for hours. After the third hour of constant thrusting, the mage took a five minute break to review what he had accomplished. 

The thrust was a very straight forward and blatant attack, making it easy to dodge. Nigen realized in order maximize the attack, deception was needed. That is precisely why he was so fond of the technique he was going to begin working on soon. It's a Bojutsu, and magic used primarily by Mage. All the thrusting had began to take its toll on Nigen's triceps. So he figured it would be a good idea to move on to another vital aspect of Bojutsu, and magic.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Nigen was a practitioner of the Bojutsu style, which utilized combinations of strikes to fluster and overwhelm opponents. If Nigen was to excel in this subtype of Bojutsu, and magic he would need speed and technique. Nigen understood speed wasn't everything, you could have the fastest slash, but if you lacked in technique you would immensely in maintaining an advantageous position. Poor technique would lead to counter opportunities for the opposition. Firstly, Nigen didn't want to follow through too much; this was sure to affect his balance negatively. So the Nigen began training his control, not letting the staff get away from him. When Nigen wanted to stop, it needed stop; when Nigen wanted the staff to change direction, it needed to change; when Nigen wanted the staff to accelerate, you get the point. 

* - Fri Oct  2 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He needed to be able to make the staff dance if that was required. He decided the best way to work on his control was to start small by making check swings. So he did he started with maneuvers he could alter with ease. He riddled the dummy with dents high and low that were delivered by short swings that Nigen controlled at will. He made the speed up at the last second, and when he appeared to aim for one spot he'd quick change direction targeting another spot completely. 
* - Fri Oct  2 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He knew he would succeed in the first phase of his control training. Now it was time for the second and final phase. This phase mainly dealt with harnessing extremely fast and powerful swings so that he didn't lose balance. Nigen wanted to start with loading up a swing and then stopping it immediately without making contact with the dummy. * - Fri Oct  2 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The first several attempts saw head of Nigen's staff tipping over and tapping the dummy. He needed to accomplish this seeming insignificant task. If not, how would he expect to deliver a vicious strike and not let the momentum overpower him? And more importantly, if an opponent evaded his strike, how would he halt the forward motion and get back in position to fend off a counter. It was official, he had to be perfect, and there could be no loose ends, no weaknesses.* - Fri Oct  2 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) After resumption, Nigen had master part 1 of phase 2. He was now more than capable of completely stopping powerful swings half way in their motion. Upon halting the staff, the staff at most moved an additional 2 inches. That was perfection as far as Nigen saw it.* - Fri Oct  2 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond)  He was now ready to complete phase 2. Nigen had been training for well over two hours now. Nigen was notorious for his below average stamina, but did have an unnatural second wind. Most people had one second wind, Nigen seemed to have infinite. This meant nothing in battle seeing as it took at least ten minutes in an exhausted state before your second wind activates. * - Fri Oct  2 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) In battle, ten minutes is more than enough to finish someone. Anyway, after taking a twenty minute break to rest and partake in a small lunch he had packed the night before, he was ready to go again. He knew what he was doing seemed insignificant but he saw training any other way as impractical. Like writing words without letters; most of his life his skill with a staff was second nature, that was good and bad. The effective skills he acquired he kept, but he also kept the things he overlooked. Nigen knew if he was to be serious about being a formidable mage, details were everything.* - Fri Oct  2 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Nigen took powerful swing after swing as he tried to prevent the off balancing effects of momentum. It was much more difficult than he expected. It was almost like every muscle and tendon in his arms had to be on the same page, and as of it right now that would have to be achieved consciously. But in time it will be applied to his muscle memory. The temperature had begun to drop and the wind started pick up. Nigen swung against the wind while his red hair blew violently in his face. * - Fri Oct  2 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Nigen had finally mastered the thrust and control. He found that the easiest way to combat the overwhelming effects of a powerful swing was to use his lower body to initiate another attack which could act as a block or a follow up to the previous attack. The little things were what we're going to make Nigen one of the greatest Bojutsu, and magic practitioners Konoha has ever seen. Nigen packed up, placing everything back in his bag, and then flung the sliced up wooden dummy across his shoulder. Nigen felt strong and disciplined. In order for him to capitalize on his training he would need to either repeat this 3 times a week. Or a sparring session with one of his peers. Nigen had woken up from his trip down memory lane. Clutching at his skull, memories that he had rather wanted to abandoned had resurfaced.
