<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Chuckled while admist turning, he had begun walking off towards a more secluded area assuming Takuma would follow suit.* - Sat Dec  5 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Allowing Takuma to take the lead, he had watched with a smile on his face. The handseals thrown together hadn't fully given away what jutsu Takuma had planned on executing. Once the katon chakra had been released from his mouth, revealing a sizable fire technique. Nigen couldn't help but to clap, of course he hadn't wanted to be hit by such a technique. He had decided to strafe, hopefully using his speed to easily avoid the fireball that had been headed his way. If this had worked his eyes would have widened noticing that Takuma had moved from his initial location.* - Sat Dec  5 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) whispers: (Atk speed 5) - Sat Dec  5 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His eyes had scanned the area for Takuma, locking back onto his target that had already been darting towards him. His aura hadn't been malicious, infact it had been the exact opposite, as if he had been cheering Takuma on silently. Once Takuma had closed the gap, and the kunai had been pulled out. His hands quickly reached out in an attempt to grab ahold of Takuma's wrists. If this had worked, he would've followed up with a single light knee to his stomach. It had been clear that Nigen hadn't been aiming to hurt Takuma, but more likely to show him his openings.

(atk speed is 10. Tai is 18)* - Sat Dec  5 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had released his hold on the hand that hadn't been wielding the kunai, sidestepping around him he had hoped to bend his arm against his will. A punch being sent towards him, had hopefully been caught by the same free hand before being rejected. Another kick had been given towards the back of his leg hopefully causing it to buckle weakening his balance. Pushing off of him he'd attempt to create a bit of distance between them.

"Taijutsu isn't really my strength. It doesn't look as if it is yours either." he joked.* - Sat Dec  5 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Gave of a brief nod, not wanting to hold him up anymore. 

"Sure, I don't mind. Stay safe."* - Sat Dec  5 23:01:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Letting out a sigh of confusion, behind the veil of acting he had been yucking it up. There hadn't been a care in his world as to what was going on. Only the slight disappointment of not being able to obtain another spar with Ziare as soon as he had hoped it would've happened. Nevertheless, making his way outside he began to take his new jumpsuit out for a spin.

Of course he could see that she hadn't been the type to simply abide by the rules at all times. Retreating back to his warm smile, he had replied with a more relaxed tone, 

"Who knows what you plan to do. If you are some sort of wandering kunoichi like the one I met earlier, you may have a list of crimes. Even if Konohagakure may act as a safe haven..do not let those tendencies worm their way back out in this village.~"* - Sun Dec  6 08:43:05 2015

He had begun repeating the act as if he had been grasping something. It took several minutes as he tried to connect the dots, but it may have taken more time. His gaze still placed upon her, before snapping back into reality. Realizing that new arrivals had made there way into the shop. 

"Right, well as long as you're not trying to seduce a higher up. I won't have to arrest you."* - Sun Dec  6 08:59:18 2015

A Doberman next to him, beginning to sniff all around, the dog had been slightly on guard, before Nigen had crouched down, his right hand began to brush against the dog's back in an attempt to calm it down.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The doberman began to become more agitated with each step she made. Holding out his free hand towards her in an attempt to halt her actions, 

"You don't need to get any closer. For some reason this dog doesn't enjoy your presence."* - Mon Dec  7 00:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Sighed, he had whispered to the dog before patting it one last time. It had immediately taken off. Sprinting away from the area, he had released a brief sigh. 

"So now what are you planning to do?"* - Mon Dec  7 00:36:16 2015
