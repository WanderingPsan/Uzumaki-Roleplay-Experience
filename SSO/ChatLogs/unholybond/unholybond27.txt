<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: We've already discussed this.  - Thu Nov 26 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The one - Ichirou, was it? Or Kida? - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The bodyguard of Shiro - the one you've already taken claim of for the actions of. You've said yourself you agree you'd be at fault if she took the life of others. - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You're taking agency for her actions. She is an object - you're an agent. - Thu Nov 26 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The man as her bodyguard is the object of her - she is taking responsibility for whatever remaining agency he may have. This is because he went in under her name. And she went in under your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Following the chain - it falls back to you. You're the one with the ultimate agency of the entire web. - Thu Nov 26 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If a general were to bring his men - a lieutenant held a recruit under him and the lieutenant under the general. - Thu Nov 26 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If the recruit went crazy and murdered civilians would it not be the fault of the general who brought his men? - Thu Nov 26 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Much like a village or a kage is blamed for the actions of its shinobis. - Thu Nov 26 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The chain of command goes all the way up to you. - Thu Nov 26 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She didn't take any lives. - Thu Nov 26 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She made a deal with that man that he would protect her. - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The was nothing stated about taking the blame for the people he randomly kills. - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And from this deal he was allowed passage. - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Actually.. - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And from this passage he went crazy and harmed a civilian. - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We made that deal inside this village. - Thu Nov 26 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He traveled on his own, and somehow gained entry. - Thu Nov 26 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Also..hypothetically speaking.. - Thu Nov 26 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If you've got some proof feel free to prsent it. - Thu Nov 26 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even if this was traced back to me... - Thu Nov 26 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What does this do to me? - Thu Nov 26 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We both know in the end that my hands are clean. - Thu Nov 26 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Wearing gloves to keep your hands clean of a crime doesn't wipe away any of the guilt. - Thu Nov 26 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I have no guilt, for I did nothing wrong. - Thu Nov 26 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This is for the kage and you to discuss. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: There's no need for me to prove my claims. The truth is just that. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'd gain nothing from lying. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even you know that. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You'd keep passage within the village. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Judging by the fact that the Mizukage didn't kill those two on the spot.. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And you hardly gained anything by lying and saying you were intending to kill me. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He didn't care for the man that was injured. - Thu Nov 26 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Actually..it was an attempt to save your life. - Thu Nov 26 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You see.. - Thu Nov 26 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That man..was crazy. - Thu Nov 26 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Only craziness can combat itself. - Thu Nov 26 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Plus, I do get jealous. - Thu Nov 26 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: But you wouldn't be to blame for hurting me. - Thu Nov 26 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right? Like you said just earlier. - Thu Nov 26 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I would.. - Thu Nov 26 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: For I have ties with you that go deeper.. - Thu Nov 26 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Than just a random person. - Thu Nov 26 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even if you don't believe it, Heiwa-kun. I watch over you. - Thu Nov 26 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: For Ushinawa and Hideki have never hurt me. - Thu Nov 26 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: With that I like to give back.. - Thu Nov 26 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: By allowing them to live on through you. - Thu Nov 26 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..... - Thu Nov 26 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'd also like to see who you'll truly resemble in ideals.. - Thu Nov 26 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe you'll potentially gain the power to order me around?~ - Thu Nov 26 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That'd be different. - Thu Nov 26 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you're dead before I can see that, then it'd be boring. - Thu Nov 26 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is a win-win for me helping you stay alive when I can. - Thu Nov 26 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Even if you think I'm a creep. I do honor friendship. - Thu Nov 26 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sadly, most friendships are false. - Thu Nov 26 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I'll talk to the kage. - Thu Nov 26 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: There's no need. - Thu Nov 26 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: As I said..I've already spoken with them. - Thu Nov 26 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And? - Thu Nov 26 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is also why I am here.. - Thu Nov 26 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He'd like to speak with me. - Thu Nov 26 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Thu Nov 26 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You talked to him and he said he'd like to talk to you? - Thu Nov 26 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yes, messages are quite slow. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It is faster to get anything else across in person. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It isn't as if I am on the run.. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's not really the same as speaking to him. - Thu Nov 26 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We spoke as in he told me what happened to some extent. - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I told him that they weren't under my care, and that I had no idea as to the antics that they have been up to. - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I can't be responsible for every person that is injured in this world. - Thu Nov 26 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Those under you you are responsible for. - Thu Nov 26 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: As I've said.. - Thu Nov 26 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The only one -under- me is "Shiro". - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Anyone that decides to associate themselves with her aren't under my watch, or her 's. - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Let's put it this way.. - Thu Nov 26 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If I have to decide on saving Kida, Ichiro, or Shiro.. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You know who I'm going to pick. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The matter of agreement with her is the difference. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The man had an agreement to be her bodyguard. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That's of similar clout to a shinobi swearing under a kage. - Thu Nov 26 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yes, and the agreement of the bodyguard is to protect the person. - Thu Nov 26 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: This doesn't fall under that. - Thu Nov 26 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I doubt this man was even a threat to Shiro if she was on the scene. - Thu Nov 26 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: His entrance would be guaranteed by Shiro's own entrance. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Meaning whatever he does that is not intended to protect her..isn't my, or her problem. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which, in itself, is guaranteed by your own. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The deal was made here. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He entered on his own. - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I do wonder what I'd be sentenced.. - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you were the Mizukage, you'd most likely lock me up for several years. - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Like I said I'd talk to the kage myself just in case he's..feeling dumb. - Thu Nov 26 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. I'd banish Kida and Ichirou. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Prevent their entry even with your passage. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They'd be unable to enter. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That doesn't bother me. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Which is why I said I'd talk to the kage. - Thu Nov 26 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Psh..you're so nice to me. - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I feel as if you really do care for me! - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The main reason they're even being punished is because they tortured him. - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Come..come..let's hug it out. - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..I'll pass. - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You still let Ortho go. - Thu Nov 26 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I let Ortho go..because I was more concerned about him not killing you. - Thu Nov 26 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sometimes you have to make choices. - Thu Nov 26 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Infact, you should be thanking me. - Thu Nov 26 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I know deep down inside, you are. - Thu Nov 26 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sadness.. - Thu Nov 26 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..Are you going to be remaining in the village to wait for the Kage? - Thu Nov 26 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yep. - Thu Nov 26 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Who knows.. - Thu Nov 26 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I may even join the village. - Thu Nov 26 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Quite the discussion. - Thu Nov 26 02:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Good eye open nap. . - Thu Nov 26 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't think she's really concerned about you, Sado. - Thu Nov 26 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well. - Thu Nov 26 03:54:40 2015

Tengoku's talk of someone potentially looking for him did pique his curiousity. His gaze bounced from Tengoku over towards Kariudo, observing her from top to bottom hadn't given him much to work on. Nonetheless he had decided to investigate, 

"Who would you be looking for?"* - Fri Nov 27 20:00:12 2015
