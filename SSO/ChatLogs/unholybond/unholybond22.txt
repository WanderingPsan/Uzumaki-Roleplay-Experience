<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Achieve those eyes. - Tue Nov 17 11:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had made his way back to the spot of his items. Digging them up he had wanted to move them quite a bit away. Deciding to take a caravan that had been seen traveling from Kiri, he had rode towards Sunagakure before breaking up with them. The journey hadn't been too long, due to this. He had remembered the harsh sands of Wind Country. Shrugging them off with relative ease, he had made his way towards a secluded area. His hands digging into the sand. Parting it he buried his treasures so no one would be able to find them. This would've secured his position, soaking in the warmth. He had then set on for Sunagakure.


His trek towards Sunagakure wasn't long, nor was it hard thanks to the caravan. He had of course stopped infront of the guards, attempting to communicate with them hopefully to get their help. They would've hopefully send word of a new visitor wanting access to Sunagakure.* - Tue Nov 17 21:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Stopped in his tracks, coughing mainly to clear out any flem that could've been in his throat. 

"Hey, does anyone know who owns that place.."The Angry Aunt?!" he inquired at an audible tone.* - Wed Nov 18 00:47:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Itched the side of his face, a bead of sweat rolling down his cheek. 

"Heh, I'll talk with ya' later about the details. I actually have to buy it first.." he chucked trying to seem as warm as possible. Just as quickly as he arrived he had slowly began to slip away, 

"Things to do, people to see.~"* - Wed Nov 18 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: It has been ages.  - Wed Nov 18 00:58:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: I'll have to do better..at hiding myself.. - Wed Nov 18 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Slowly tried to sneak up on their training session. Slowly but surely making his way towards the dead tree. He would prop himself up against it while trying to listen in on their conversation.* - Wed Nov 18 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He tried his best to remain quiet. His intent to kill for the moment had been restrained. He had just reached his destination, why were things going south so quickly. 

*Think..happy normal happy thoughts...* he chanted to himself over and over.* - Wed Nov 18 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Happy..happy..happy.. - Wed Nov 18 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His heart had skipped a beat. He should've known that this area would be akin to a radioactive waste dump to him. Yet, something was even more off. There was no reason as to why he should be feeling 'fear'. The amount of hoy energy pouring out from Kuro had been different. Normally Kuro wouldn't have had the skill to have such a level of output. Clutching his chest, he hadn't been so green as to lose himself completely. Keeping cool, he had tried to regain his composure.

*Tch...damn that man...* he thought while forcing himself to keep his curses in check, not wanting to draw anymore attention to the tree he had chose.* - Wed Nov 18 01:10:49 2015
