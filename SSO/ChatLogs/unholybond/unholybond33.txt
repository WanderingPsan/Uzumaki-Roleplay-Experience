Eventually the sightings had been more frequent in Northeastern part of the village. 

"I'm looking for a person by the name of 'Akira'. I've been searching each house to make sure none of the villagers have been tricked into harboring a potential criminal. I'd like to do the same for your place." * - Mon Dec  7 01:05:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He hadn't made chase, simply watching the guy act like the fool that he wanted to appear as. A warm smile had flooded his outward appearance, sadly this hadn't been the case from within. A bit of curiousity that began to chip away at his being. One thing had been clear, *I'll find out who that person is..eventually..* he thought his right hand being placed at his chin.

"Well that was different.."* - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Sighed, while strolling into the restaurant.It may have appeared as if a long day's work had gotten to him, his movements were slightly sluggish. Making his way towards the counter. The cashier had been waiting to take his order, flashing off a warm smile he'd only gesture with his hands. Having come here quite often they had already understood his usual dish. The chef and cashier gave him a brief nod before he had made his way to an empty table. 

It hadn't taken long before a waitress came with his order, it hadn't been fancy just a simple dumpling and cup of piping hot tea. He had prepared to dig in, eating as if he hadn't seen food in quite a while. Gulping the singular dumpling down within seconds. His right hand quickly reached for his cup, gulping down the hot tea without a care for the temperature. A loud burp quickly followed while he had patted his chest clearly content with his meal.* - Thu Dec 10 07:15:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Flagging for a refill on his tea, a waitress eventually did come up to him with a kettle easily refilling it. Glancing over towards the group his sight bouncing over towards Asteroth. The stink eye had been seen clearly, but all that would be returned was a grin with eyes that had lacked any sort of emotion. His brows wiggled upward for a moment before he had regained his composure.
