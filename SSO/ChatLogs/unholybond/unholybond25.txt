<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Huh. - Mon Nov 23 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The only thing that's obscured to be 'pure' is the energy that those priests use. - Mon Nov 23 02:04:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You simply are interpreting it that way. - Mon Nov 23 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm stating what everyone else says about it. - Mon Nov 23 02:07:34 2015
