"This is as far as we can take ya' boy.." the driver spoke up with a hefty country accent. Nodding, he'd thank the people with a warm smile before hopping out of the back carriage.

His humming had been cut short, with seemingly no reason to fear he had approached the group calling out to them.

"Hey! I'm shocked that there are so many stand-outs around. Last time I was here there were nothing, but rag-tag villagers.."  a sigh of relief escaped his mouth while he tried to regain his breath acting as if he had been walking for quite some time.* - Sun Nov 29 20:55:40 2015
