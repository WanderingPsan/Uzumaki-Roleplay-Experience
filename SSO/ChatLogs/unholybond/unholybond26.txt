<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Out of five. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What about it? - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He brought with him bandits. A lot of them. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They broke in to places and slaughtered not just military - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Innocents. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: All because he was mad at Kirie who was already dead. - Thu Nov 26 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They followed him. - Thu Nov 26 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: As Kida and Ichirou followed you. - Thu Nov 26 01:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They were simply here to do what they wanted. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Entered the village together. Joked together. Spent most of your time with them. They were allowed passage no doubt under your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You may seek for a scapegoat, but you'll find it hard for me to fit that role. - Thu Nov 26 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They weren't Shinobi or villagers of this place. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: They were allowed here upon the passage of your name. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Isn't that simply Kirigakure's fault? - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Their lax security allowed two unidentified shinobi to linger.. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: As I've said my pet, Shiro was the only one I was looking after. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Shiro has a bodyguard which was the other male. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That bodyguard is not under my protection. - Thu Nov 26 01:27:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then it is under the protection of Shiro. Meaning Shiro is to blame. - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm not about to take the blame for his problems. - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: However, if Shiro is to blame, and you're to blame for what Shiro does, then that means, transitively, that you're to blame for him. - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh? - Thu Nov 26 01:28:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sadly, I'm not that -man's- caretaker. - Thu Nov 26 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Try as you might to blame me for his troubles, but I do doubt that Shiro ordered that man to commit the acts he did. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. You're Shiro's. And Shiro is the caretaker of that man. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She is not responsible for what he does off the clock. - Thu Nov 26 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If he is allowed passage within the village due to the requirement of being her bodyguard - then yes, she is. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Let me put it this way.. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Killing anyone I see.. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..... - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If you failed to stop me, is it right to blame you for my acts? - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That is a false analogy. - Thu Nov 26 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I am not in any way the person that allowed you within the village through our laws. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If I snuck you into the village ignoring the guards? - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: But you allowed me to murder. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...... - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You're even chatting with me right now. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So you've acknowledged that I'm here.. - Thu Nov 26 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yet..you allowed me to do what I have done. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And just what have you done? - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Just as it is out of your power to stop my hypothetical scenario. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh..murder people in that scenario. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The difference is that Heiwa would stop you there. - Thu Nov 26 01:33:52 2015
