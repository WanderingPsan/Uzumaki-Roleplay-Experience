<br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Test.* - Sun Aug 30 21:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Nigen was from a family that dedicated a great deal of time to training bojutsu, so he was already highly skilled in the art form. Nigen’s goals over the next few days were to brush on the fundamentals that he has been overlooking as of late. Discipline was a necessity for a warlock. After digesting the small details that were likely to make all the difference in a battle he would apply what he learned to begin contemplating new techniques. But what Nigen was really looking forward to this week was the last day of training. He would have a very special teacher come down to visit him to help him train more vital skills as well as what type of mentality a warlock must have. This visitor was Nigen’s father . The new trainee hadn’t seen his father or his family since his graduation. He was looking forward to working with him; Even though they have clashed frequently in the past due to Nigen’s lack of obedience. But Nigen was prepared to comply completely with his father’s advice. It was going to take every fiber of his being to do so. Nigen’s father was only a little bit taller than Nigen. He also had blue hair, but his was short and wavy as opposed to spiky. Nigen's father despite being in his fifties was an extremely fit man. He had a solid abdomen as well as imposing biceps and triceps; he was also rather quick. He speed however, was a little hindered by a bad knee though. Nigen’s Father's personality was strict and by the book.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Shizan, Nigen But if there was anything Nigen’s Father cared more about than tradition, it was family. That is the main reason Nigen's Father, despite not totally understanding or condoning Nigen’s decision to be a shinobi, has supported him none the less. Now, that doesn’t mean Nigen's Father doesn’t pry and probe at his son to choose otherwise, but at the end of the day he is there for him. The time had come for Nigen to truly train. It seemed like every time the eager magician trainee set aside to train his bojutsu, his plans would be derailed by a sudden mission or some other unexpected occurrence that he would be required to attend to. He considered going to their training area but it was a decent while away and Nigen didn’t want to take the chance of something stealing him from his training on the way there. Therefore, he decided to train in the general area of the village. He chose a spot about 100 meters from his apartment; this particular spot seemed to always get a significant amount less sunlight than any other area within the general area. It was adjacent to the weapon shop. This spot was perfect for training, mostly flat with a few undulations that would be useful as launch pads for aerial attacks. Nigen carried a wooden dummy that he kept in his apartment, and his backpack that contained other training essential. “Yes, this is it; I’m going to finally train.” Nigen said rather emotionally as he stepped outside his apartment with his wooden training dummy propped on his shoulder. “I made, I actually made it!!” Nigen said excitedly as he arrived to the spot he had chosen for training. He stumbled across this somewhat unusual training ground during one of his D-rank missions. The young magician wasted little time as he quickly set up his training station. He would be utilizing a 30 meter radius for his training, and he marked the area off as such. The wooden dummy would indicate the center. Nigen was very meticulous and liked things to have a set order, this was extremely important to him so it’s no surprise to see him going to such lengths in preparation. Nigen was always working on new or already existing techniques; his latest most desired technique was still in the developmental stages. There were a few fundamental components of his skill set that were in need of honing before he would be ready to take on his new technique fully. The key component to his new bojutsu maneuver was the thrust, which was the finishing and most devastating portion of the jutsu. His stave was about 48 inches in length (1.5meters); Nigen positioned himself 36 inches away from the dummy. He had his left foot forward and both knees slightly bent. Both of Nigen’s hand wrapped around the handle of the lethal weapon, he twisted his body bringing his right elbow back; the elbow would act as the driving force for most of the power the strike would inflict. After he cocked his elbow, he uncoiled his torso firing both his arms forward; both fully extend to penetrate the wooden dummy. The determined magician would repeat this simple and short process over and over again for hours. After the third hour of constant thrusting, the ninja took a five minute break to review what he had accomplished. The thrust was a very straight forward and blatant attack, making it easy to dodge. Nigen realized in order maximize the attack, deception was needed. That is precisely why he was so fond of the technique he was going to begin working on soon. It’s a bojutsu used primarily by magicians. All the thrusting had began to take its toll on Nigen’s triceps. So he figured it would be a good idea to move on to another vital aspect of bojutsu. Nigen was a practitioner of the Battojutsu style, which utilized combinations of strikes to fluster and overwhelm opponents. If Nigen was to excel in this subtype of bojutsu he would need speed and technique. Nigen understood speed wasn’t everything, you could have the fastest slash, but if you lacked in technique you would immensely in maintaining an advantageous position. Poor technique would lead to counter opportunities* - Fri Sep 04 15:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Nigen brushed past the leaves heading to the southern forest of the village hidden in the leaves. This place seemed to appear small, compact, cozy, however you would phrase it but still passed an excellent training ground for Nigen and his new technique he wished to work on. 'Dark Magic: Black-Pillar Prison Technique.' For this technique, the user converts chakra into timber under the ground and makes it grow rapidly, while forming it into a Darken prison. The timber itself is treated with a chakra coating, making its destruction difficult to c-rank techniques or weapons or below. Growing up, Nigen was told about this technique during the war his father took part in. His father apparently used this technique as it had the great ability to detain prisoners, but it could also be used as a disciplinary measure for quarreling subordinates. Nigen decided long ago that this technique was going to be among the first of the many technique he would learn. It was truly beneficial with no real danger to the user. It was encouraged within Nigen's family to learn this technique as it had helped many of his ancestors. He thought long and hard about the uses for this technique. A few different ways came to mind almost instantly, but first, he had to learn the technique in question. As the wind collided with Nigen, fiddling with his hair as it whispered to him, Nigen finally landed in a secluded area and checked his surroundings for any animal traps or signs of others so there was no disturbance in his training. Within minutes after scanning the area Nigen had concluded that it was undisturbed and deemed it safe to train here. With a sigh of relief Nigen began his warming up exercises and also began stretching to limber up. Nigen let out a deep breath in preparation for his new technique. He thought of the shape he had to mold in order to create the prison. The size, the quality, the dimensions, all of them had to be taken into consideration. He also had in mind that he would not be able to make the great prisons his elders were able to create. He remembered his father telling him when he was growing up of the great prison technique that could hold easily fifty people and quite sturdy and durable at that, with holding the many techniques the prisoners forced upon the black walls of the technique. With a technique of that size and quantity Nigen thought to start off much simpler than that. "A holding cell would be the appropriate start to this technique. I'll make my way up to the great prison in years to come but, for now, let's try with the basics." Nigen exclaimed to himself openly. After assuring him of his target he began focusing his chakra molding within the earth below him. Sweat was already appearing as he concentrated long and hard to all of the details he had to take into consideration. Letting out his energy he formed a rather 'wonky' attempt of a jail cell. He looked wide eyed at his technique and pushed with little effort to find it toppling over before him. "Damn it! Nigen shouted from the bottom of his lungs. He remained calm despite letting off the little steam he kept stored shortly after seeing his creation. He paced back and forth looking at his attempt from earlier before coming to a halt. He looked as though he had an idea. Making his way over to his creation he examined the ins and out of the cage and tried to look for the problem within his technique. The corners were counter pivoted which led to the instability. He continued to scan and figured he wasn't using enough chakra to coat the technique which was a dire asset to have. With his observations complete it was time to focus once again on the task at hand. He focused his chakra to the earth once more and began shape shifting the particles under the earth's surface to form the dark needed. Nigen then began to form the foundation of the prison technique before bringing it to the surface. As it reached the surface the darken cell began to shoot up around the foundation as the cell bars. The roof of the prison technique then instantly formed over the rest and sealed tightly shut followed by a chakra coat that almost glistened in the sun. The technique was set in place. But did it pass the inspection test? Nigen kicked the holding cell yet it did not budge. In fact, he hurt his foot in the process causing him to refrain from shouting profanities. It was sturdy and withheld a kick but Nigen couldn't just leave it at that. He needed to know the capabilities of this holding cell. He bombarded the cell with taijutsu and kunai yet it appeared to be unaffected by the assault. Nigen's mouth widened with a grin. It was the technique he was looking for. A perfect little holding cell for an enemy, or to pull a prank on his friends and detain them. He left the technique in the open and admired it from a distance. He pulled out a sandwich and took a rewarding bite letting out a reliving sigh as he felt he had mastered a new technique. But he knew this technique could be expanded. There was a bigger version that he must learn in order to keep his family tradition of large detaining techniques. Thinking back on it. Maybe the Mages would have made great officers of the law; with technique like this it would be hard for the enemy to escape captivity. He had heard that the Uchiha were placed as the officers of the law though, and for reasons that were misunderstood for many years. But since then they learned to live in harmony. Maybe he could show off his new technique to some of them. Finishing his small meal Nigen tapped the cell for good luck in the near future before heading off back to the village hidden in the leaves to rest in his home, waiting the next day.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Nigen began his day as he usually did, with a warm shower, fitting into his black jumpsuit and with a hearty filling breakfast washed down with his favorite brand of apple juice. Today was a day he scheduled for himself to learn a new technique and a valuable one at that, the 'Fire Clone Technique'. As he locked the door from the outside, departing his home, Nigen brushed his fingers through his hair and scanned the streets of the village hidden in the leaves. For some reason, Nigen seemed quite drawn to the Ninja Academy. Nigen dashed to the school for shinobi and noticed it was recess so he searched for the sensei on patrol and soon found him among the crowd of shinobi. Nigen asked the teacher about elemental techniques and as coincidence appeared, it turned out that this teacher in particular was an elementalist also. He was told, in detail, the description of this technique by one of the teachers of the ninja academy. "The Fire Clone Technique is similar to the Shadow Clone Technique except it creates clones out of fire that have one-tenth of the original person's power. Like other solid clone techniques, the clones can be used to perform tasks the user is unable or unwilling to do for themselves. The range of the clone is limited however, as it cannot travel very far from the original body without losing control. Like other clone techniques, if the fire clones are injured enough they will revert back to normal fire.' The sensei lectured Nigen. In return, Nigen showed his gratitude by thanking him and giving a formal bow before his departure. He acknowledged the guards at the village's south gates by nodding his head he left making his way to his usual training area. He leaped to the overlapping trees and made haste allowing the wind to show slight force on his journey accompanying the leaves as they brushed passed him, whistling with the wind. Before long, he reached the small forest south of the village. The people who took this path were often headed towards the village docks to embark on a journey to the large and vast ocean. He arrived at the area in which he last trained his Dark Release: Black-Pillar Prison Technique. The prison was still laying, tattered from time and usage from before. Nigen was determined to use learn this technique as the mere Clone Technique from his academy days could help in battle and were a simply means of distraction, but with this technique they could help him in his battles he may come across in the future. Being a hybrid and also counted as a shinobi, Nigen was eventually going to take on missions consisting of battles with rogue ninjas, bandits and other beings possibly from the underlying towns within the fire country, let alone the rival countries that trained ninja to possibly invade or sabotage the village hidden in the leaves. After settling into his environment, Nigen began meditating under a tree where he kept his gear to the side of. He listened to the sounds of nature and became in tune with them, listening to the flow of the nearby streams and the leaves that caressed against the others to give off a rustling sound. The faint sounds of crickets and other wildlife where to be heard in the distance also, almost singing to one another. Nigen stood from where he sat in almost the same position and called back his clone technique to examine the structure of the basic academy student technique. After thorough inspection, he cancelled the technique causing the clone to disintegrate into a puff of smoke and vanish into the breeze that flew by constantly. He thought that the process was a simple as adding fire to the technique, filling the clone to give it that solid interior and exterior being. He performed a few hand seals and infused fire to the technique but all that was produced was a drueling buffoon of a clone that fire seeped from many holes on its body. Nigen thought long and hard at his solution. Obviously, the clone was not perfected to contain the amount of fire to fill the body and needed to be measured with precise equations. Filling this clone over looked that hypothesis with ease which is why it was a failure. He then channeled the chakra and fire needed to perform the technique one last time, lowering the fire level greatly to ten percent. With a perfect solid clone in front of his eyes in an instant, Nigen touched the clones shoulder to feel its solid form thanks to the fire levels. He then nodded to the clone as gesture to attack him. With a right hook coming into contact with Nigen's face he placed his hand upon his face in disbelief. He had formed the clone he wished to achieve. With a smirk, Nigen quickly roundhouse kicked the clone only to see it turn to flames moments after contact. He knelt down and examined the charred ground that was once his clone and noticed that the fire he was looking at was the amount he had stored into the clone to perform the technique. Nigen smiled as he was already thinking of strategies in combat he could use this technique with. He summoned two more clones and made them depart into the small forest and observe the wildlife before making them vanish into the charred grounds that were all that was left of them. This was a test to see if Nigen could use the clones to gather intelligence on the surrounding areas without actually having to be there. Once the clones had vanished, their memories were transferred to Nigen, yet another positive outcome to the fire clone technique. Nigen then made his way back for the village hidden in the leaves. He greeted the guards as he commonly did and made his way to the academy to try and find the sensei he spoke to in the earlier hours of the day. Upon finding him he approached with a wide grin hinting that he had completed the technique. The sensei smiled and praised Nigen. He thanked the sensei once again and departed to rest in his home after fulfilling another day of tranining.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Upon his arrival, the sun was at its peak, shining through the leaves that were bound to the area by the trees. The sunlight seeped through to the earth leaving the rays of light naked to the skin that it touched upon Nigen as he continued his short journey. Something that took the Mage by surprise was the fact that there was a horse within the forest residing in his usual spot. He approached with caution as he gazed upon the sheer beauty of the black coated creature. Its spotlight was the greatest ray of light that breached through the environment which caused the creature to become more beautiful. Nigen continued his approach but seemed to have stepped on a twig of some sort that startled the animal. How odd it was to find a creature of such elegance in such a place. It must have escaped from a stable in one of the neighboring towns. Within a few feet of the animal, Nigen reached out to the horse and touched the straight and narrow hair from its head. It was as soft and as smooth as silk and yet was accompanied by the rough and muscular exterior of the horse's neck as he brushed through it. The horse gave off an exertion through its mouth and moved closer to the Mage, embracing what he had to offer. The ninja moved to the side and picked some berries from a nearby plant and fed the horse but was soon rejected as it began to move away. Soon enough, a whistle could be heard and a rather loud one at that. The horse galloped with ease and with a sight to behold. Watching in awe for a few seconds the ninja finally closed his mouth and smirked that he so commonly did. He was here to train and he thought the horse had just gave him an idea. Nigen had never before created a technique but there was a first for everything. He would make a new jutsu on this very day. He was unsure of what elemental affinity he would associate the technique with, whether it be elemental, or darkness magic. He gazed at his surroundings. The trees had helped his decision upon looking at them. They were withered, old, rough and hard. A quite strong force would no doubt come from that but what of the speed? A horse was rather fast after all. 
* - Fri Sep 04 15:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He then thought of the earth. He leaned down once again and picked up some soil. It was smooth yet it fell apart easily. The aerodynamics was all wrong as if it was hard it would yet again affect its movement. Then it led him to water. Water flowed, it rushed and when it did, it was rough on the skin. If contained it could be carried, the very idea of controlling this technique was suited to the water element. His brain threw out ideas upon ideas, the lights were on and answers could be found in every inch. With such flexibility it could be achieved in no time at all. It was down to Nigen focus and mold the chakra and water to form a horse and use it to his will. He sat down with his legs crossed and his hands resting in the gap between. His eyes closed and his head began to clear. He listened to the woodland and embraced the breeze of the wind and the rays from the sun. The wildlife could be heard calling to one another creating an orchestra of the wildlife that lived within the woods. It was only a matter of time and effort before Nigen would be able to utilize a new technique to add to his arsenal.* - Fri Sep 04 15:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He opened his eyes slowly and was greeted by the suns glare. Averting his eyes to the stream the water seemed so clear almost like it was made of glass if it was not for the ripples that collided with the banks that ran alongside it. He stood stall and stoic and let out a release of air slowly and calmly before mustering up the energy he thought he had needed. With a few mutters of a makeshift incantation and the fusion of the water and magic, a remarkable sight was to be seen. In the stream emerged the outlines of a horse, it was unrefined of course but something that beauty came along with had his sights transfixed on his technique. The horse stood at 314 centimeters, rather large compared to the size of the common horse. It seemed to have looked at Nigen intensely yet patiently. Its head swiveled back and forth not knowing its bearings seemingly. The water seemed to have flowed like a waterfall along its body, not having that solid appearance he had hoped for.
* - Fri Sep 04 15:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) After being mesmerized by the horse and its appearance, he ordered it to attack in which it complied. It ran down the stream with great speed but Nigen could not hold it for much longer as it dissipated back into the stream. The Mage continued to smile though despite the technique coming to a close. He formed the hand seals and concentrated his magic and its fusion with the water once again. He needed to focus with greater effort. He began refining the horse and gave it a more solid structure before activating the technique. Before long, the horse was summoned once more. This time it was just how he had imagined it. A beautiful water horse that seemed to glisten with a white shine to it from the sun's rays. Water did not seem flow from it much body and the structure was clearly much more solid than the previous attempt. It was even more beautiful to the eye. The horse itself seemed to be like that of a horse at the beginning of a race. It seemed determined with little distractions. Calm and collected as the horse was it still needed to fulfill its duties. Nigen had ordered the horse to charge at which it did with greater speed than before. He then attempted to control it but was deemed difficult. After a short while, the horse complied and ran where Nigen had wished it to go. He had his own horse companion for a technique. It was quite the sight to behold to create a technique out of animals being its inspiration. He pushed the horse to go faster and faster after each stride reaching its limit at twenty five miles per hour. With a smirk, the Mage conjured a construct out of the water to his side and ordered it to stand out in the open. He wondered of the possibilities of the offensive structure of the horse and what would happen when collided with another. The horse raced towards the water construct and collided with such force at its tenacious speed. The water construct was immediately destroyed on impact, combining the water with the horses. The horse turned to face Nigen and approach him as it slowed to halt before him. The Mage reached towards the summoned creature and stroke it gently, but it was like stroking the stream of water that was before them. Intriguing to say the least.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) As his new technique had dissipated, Nigen began to focus more energy. He needed to muster up much more than what he had just used as this technique needed to be with more width. The odds of a single horse hitting its target regardless of speed would be too low for his standard. This technique could be greatly improved through width of its initial attack as he seemed to have no control of the horse when it first arrives to the scene. * - Fri Sep 04 15:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The multiple horses would prove to be just like his clone controlling abilities. He may make them move as he pleases after the first attack, but it was only a matter of perfecting the creations first off than escalating the ability to its true function. Nigen began to form the necessary incantation and fused water and energy once more to create the horse that he was now growing accustom too. Instead, four horses were molded all of great height and width when formed side by side. The horses each stood at 124 inches and a combined width of ten meters. They all charged with increasing speeds. Watching this was a sure pleasure as the beauty and elegance of the horses was the center of attention. Their feet formed a mist of water, almost as if they were trampling through water at a shallow pond even on the solid earth before them. The sounds of rushing waters colliding matched that of the waves of the ocean. It was like he was at the beach just hearing these creatures rush towards a non-existent target. Soon they separated to which Nigen focused to the best of his abilities to control each horse and their directions. It did prove quite difficult as it was not the same of controlling the clones which he was attuned to. These were more complex. It was just as though Nigen had to tame the horses himself before he could use them to his advantage. It turned out that Nigen had this natural, raw talent in control of animals, probably because he was so in tune with nature itself. He surrounded himself in woodland most of his life and every possible chance he could get. It was a great way to enjoy peace and the many wonders of wildlife, he knew how most of the animals functioned and what they did during certain conditions with the weather. The horses soon all came to a close towards Nigen as he began to pet each one with equal attention. Some gave off and exertion of the sounds of water flapping before their refined mouths before they all fell to their knees almost as if they were about to nap before. They all bowed their heads to which Nigen replied by falling to his own knees and bowing his head also. Soon they began to melt away, disintegrating into the now soft earth, thick with moisture. With another technique that seemed to have been completed, Nigen continued to enjoy the nature and relax upon a tree branch to clear his mind of other things in life. It was a beautiful day, after all.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The young mage could be seen in his usual training area in the small south forest in the wilderness of the Village Hidden in the Leaves. The day was fair, humid, and clouds could be seen gathering around the suns gaze, almost hiding it from the nature of the earth it shone on. Nigen gave a concerned look, almost depressing as the sun was his main source of warmth on top of his attire. His outfit was consisted of a cloak emblazoned with the mage symbol worn over a simple black jumpsuit. His weapon could be seen nestling against the tree trunk, the staff standing tall while remaining still. His back was against the trunk also as he looked towards the sky as the earth seemed to rotate with greater speed than usual. Of course, this was caused by the illusion of the clouds gathered by the wind making them move faster across the sky that was far and wide. With a small sigh, the mage reached into a bag that was sitting to his left. The plastic bag could be heard rustling just as the leaves were against the force of the wind. He opened the bag and searched briefly until he retrieved a few sandwiches. They were composed of white bread, butter and ham. With a few hastily taken bites before settling on the amount to chew on, Nigen had thought of what he was to do today. Should he go back home and prepare to take up a mission? Should he stay in his favorite spot? Maybe he could learn a new technique? All of these questions rushed through his mind as he gave the pros and cons to each of the suggestions. His sandwiches were rather bland and became an effort to eat after a short period of eating them causing him to rush them into his mouth and swallow as he settled down to clear his mind and search more clearly for the answer to his questions. With much thought, he smirked and ran his hand across his face, rubbing against his nose as it had got an itch that needed to be scratched. He stood up with much more motivation as he had settled on training a new technique. He rummaged through his own personal bag and had found a book that he had brought with him. It was the seam of the book he checked out at the library a few weeks prior to this training day which helped him learn many abilities. He flipped through each page in order to search for the technique he had confirmed to himself what to the learn, the 'Dark Spear technique.' He had finally reached the page in question and read a brief line within the book. " The user raises their staff or hand, resulting in the creation of twenty spears above them. These twenty spears are refined and crafted by dark energy. When fired, they expode upon contact with the target or the ground, leaving behind burns upon contact. " Pretty simple and obvious but luckily there wasn't an incantation for it. This technique would be almost as if he would be backed up by several archers but was proven to be an easy enough technique to learn. By concentrating his energy together, this technique could easily be formed and refined into the spear sizes he would require. Performing the hand seals, Nigen had formed a nice amount of spears that dangled by his side. It was rather odd to see spears being controlled in the form of magic but at the same time Nigen had found this quite an impressive feet. The spears that he had just formed was about the same width of a pencil. He needed it to be more durable and so channeled more energy and spears to thicken the spears to that of a bo staff, a more appropriate size he thought. He then turned to the tree that he once sat at and lunged the spears in its direction. It began hitting the tree with great speed and even hearing the crack as it made contact. He tried attacking the tree to test its strength and durability which seemed to be at his satisfaction. He returned the spears from the tree back to his side cracked it again against themselves in the open air. The spears also gave off the faint sound an explosion that he held in is grasp, quite beautiful to hear this any time he chose to. This technique would surely come in handy for apprehending many targets and would become a great asset in many years to come.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) It was a fair day in the Village hidden in the Leaves. The sun was hiding behind the clouds allowing very little sun rays to seep through and touch for warmth leaving the air humid to say the least. Nigen was already washed, teeth were already brushed, dressed and eating his breakfast of toast and apple juice. He seemed in a more cheery mood as usual, this was because he decided to train a new technique on this day. After he finished his small meal he made his way over to the hallway mirror and fixed up his hair by ruffling it to the way he had grown to prefer. He then left his domain and locked the door behind, with rustling of keys that came from his pockets as he reached for the lock to turn it. The young Mage was not in his usual Mage cloak but in a more casual look of just his black jumpsuit. He had already decided on the type of technique he would want to learn today and needed to visit the library in order to find the right technique at that. As he past many people they smiled and nodded as did Nigen in return. He had reached the library and made his way inside and checked out the book that he had looked at many times over. It was a list of known jutsu throughout the vast lands of the shinobi world. He sat in the library glancing through the pages and scanning hastily for the type of jutsu he was looking for. Before long, he had found it. His eyes widened as he had seen the title, 'Transparent Escape Technique'. He then proceeded to read its contents which eventually led him to the description of the technique. 'Once the handseals are complete the user's appearance begins to fade, effectively allowing them to be invisible to the naked eye.' Nigen gave off his infamous grin and stood, closing the book and returning it to the owner. He then made his way to his common training area in the small south forest of Konoha. Passing the guards to the gate he nodded which they did so in return. It was odd how you see the same people almost every time and yet never make an effort to learn their names. Nigen continued making his way out of the gates and leaped to the nearest sturdy branch and hastily made his way to the training area he had grown so accustomed too. As he made his arrival, the weather had not changed; the sun was still in hiding. The wildlife was of a softer tone as the sound of wind could be heard with a great roar from time to time. His hair flailed from different sides while his clothes simply flapped in the same pattern each time. He made his way to the center of the tree infested area. It was a beautiful surrounding with an almost arena like center of just land and a few patches of grass to accompany it. He closed his eyes and listened carefully to the nature around him, clearing his thoughts from any unnecessary worries he might subconsciously be thinking of. The young mage then formed the hand seal for the technique and mustered up the mixture of chakra, it was a relatively simple technique to learn. Once he had started the handsigns and executed the technique his body began to fade from the area leaving very little traces of visual perspectives on the surroundings. Nigen glanced around and but could not see himself well enough, which meant it was a success. He became much like the sun this day, hiding behind his new veil. He began to feel his way around, he did of course, have to get use to this ability and learn to utilize to the best potential. After some time the transparency began to become more bearable. Nigen could be quite adaptable and would prove to be useful when using this technique. Before long, the transparency cleared up and all was normal. The transparency even helped avoid the animals, and guards in the surroundings which was always a plus. With another grin, Nigen now had another ability to add to his arsenal and would surely be a help when thinking of a strategy or implementing this technique into one.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Nigen awoke to the sun's rays shining in across his face. His eyes shot open as if it was a rude awakening, almost as if someone had threw water over him in his peaceful slumber. He lifted his head up as if it weighed a ton. His eyes were drooping and bloodshot. He overexerts himself during the days and leaves himself with short hours to sleep during the night. The sun was his alarm clock and he knew that if he did this long enough his body would become used to it and give himself a more restful night in his slumber. He slid his lower body to the side so that his feet were touching the floor. He let out a rather long yawn and began to stretch his body to its fullest potential so that he could wake himself up for the oncoming events of the day. He left his room and made his way to the restroom where began to wash his face and brush his teeth. He then topped it all off with a nice relaxing shower that refreshed him with each second he stood underneath the shower head. He then made his way back to his room and dressed in his casual outfit of a black jumpsuit before ruffling his hair in the mirror. He made his way downstairs where he made his common found breakfast of toast with a light coat of butter and apple juice to help wash it down. He sat at his kitchen table and began his first round of toast with a rather large bite and sipping apple juice to allow the bread to run smoother down his throat. He then thought of his plans for today and eventually decided to learn a new technique. He became drawn to the use of dark techniques and how he had been neglecting their abilities and only focusing on his wood and water release techniques. Before finishing his morning meal he then thought of what type of technique he would need but he couldn't seem to think of one that interested him for the moment. He cleaned his plate and cup in the sink that was stationed behind him before heading out to the door and exiting. With the door locked behind him he made his way to the library in hopes he could find the answer to his problem and learn a new and useful technique to add to his arsenal. Once he was inside he found the book he usually checked out and glanced through the contents to find 'Dark Element Techniques' and came to an intriguing ability. 'Dark Technique: Sensory Inducement . A technique that is activated upon reciting the necessary incantation and focusing on their target. The user is then able to manipulate the level of one's pain threshold' Nigen closed the book over and thought about the possibilities. It would indeed prove to be a useful technique and could be helpful when trying to distract or escape from certain situations during battle. It was then settled that this would indeed be the technique that Nigen would learn. He made his way out of the library and down to the Village gates and traveled to the nearby small south forest of Konoha.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) 
Upon reaching his desired training area of a vast area of land that was surrounded by a stream of water and surrounding wood life of trees and plants which were accompanied by various species of bugs and birds that created sounds of an orchestral ensemble of wildlife. Nigen moved to the center of the field and began meditating. He was thinking of the way he should mold his energy. It had to be more like a bubble, or dome so there would involve a great deal of malleability to manipulate the dome. He then thought of the amount of energy needed. It was a C-rank technique after all so it didn't require much. He formed the necessary hand placement and placed his hands upon the earth, kneading energy into the ground, and around himself together in harmony to help form the technique. A small barrier had begun to form. It looked as if the entire bubble was about to cave in, but somehow maintained itself, almost as if it was regenerating constantly. This technique however, would only prove successful if he had been able to summon it without the amount of drain along with a lessened delay. Ninja tend to throw projectiles, and he didn't necessarily enjoy being stabbed at every waking moment. The young mage tended to keep it that way. He repeated the process of performing the required hand placement and placing his hands upon the earth once again. He exerted the right amount of energy and before long another larger dome had been summoned instead of just a small one. He wondered how far he could travel with the dome up, or away from the source of the dome. With another technique learned, Nigen could call it a day. He grinned slightly, thinking about how far he had come from the academy days. The amount of techniques he had learned since then and how he had bettered himself through hard work and perseverance which led him to his current rank of a Mage

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Nigen sat in his favourite barbecue restaurant ordering the same meal as always, barbecue pork with a side order of rice. As he guzzled down the tender meat the taste buds had trickled with the delicious taste that he craved each time. He took a few shovel fulls of rice before taking another sip of his cold beverage that was water before diverting back to the meat. He smiled slightly as another mouthwatering slice of pork entered his system. It was warm and slightly greasy but the flavorings of the barbecue was a delight this afternoon. He glanced out the window to the street where he could see many people going back and forth in his frame of observation. Some were in a rush while others were just playful children running around aimlessly with their toys or their friends. The sound of laughing could be heard distantly among the many voices in the crowd. The restaurant was almost full of customers before Nigen had finished what was lying on his table before him. He took a napkin and dabbed his mouth so that the sauce of the barbecue would be cleaned off his person and asked for the bill. The waiter came over and laid out the bill. He took a glance at the price and happily paid and gave thanks to the staff starting with the waiter and then the chef. With smiles all round Nigen made his way outside to continue on his day. With a full stomach Nigen decided to make his way over to his personal stash of books. The sun kissed his skin and the breeze of the wind brushed past him, cooling him down and countering the suns heat upon him. As he entered the his house he checked out the book in which he usually picked up. The book contained many known spells and was an asset to Nigen's training. It gave him many ideas and a useful arsenal that he still uses to this day. He had the feeling that he needed to learn more curse element style techniques which was the element he was usually lacking in. He only had few techniques of that particular affinity and so he began his journey within the book in search of useful technique with the curse style. He came across a low ranking ability but the thought of it could come quite useful. 'Curse Release: Dark Spear, and Dark Dome. They were interesting techniques indeed. The thought of having more techniques that could help restrain an opponent was always on his mind and a low ranking one such as this would take no time at all to learn. He made his way over to the village gates to head to his training area in the small south forest. Arriving at the gates he seen the two guards that he had walked by each time. It just so happens that the young mage heads out when the two fellow shinobi are on duty so they usually smile to each other nod. It was a rather mysterious type of friendship although they did not know each other personally. With a grin on his face Nigen leaped into the trees and began his short journey to his destination. When he arrived, the trees surrounded the area, raising his hand he decided to concentrate his energy into the palm of his hand before forming multiple bolts of dark energy. With a swift movement of his right hand the spears were spread vastly in an open are to which Nigen made his way to the center of. The sun seeped through the trees and their leaves while the breeze simply rustled the leaves creating a rustling sound as they brushed into each other. Birds and insects could be heard also, having a melodic harmony among them that gave Nigen the feeling of serenity and peace that he loved. He summoned forth his protective dome. Moving out of it he summoned several more spears standing at a distance. Within seconds, Nigen had sent down his spears onto the dome .Dust being thrown up into the air as it quickly dissipated revealing a some-what stable protective shield. He grinned as the fact that the new techniques were a success and was just as easy as he anticipated.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The dust settled, my cloak still undulating from the wind's gentle touch. There I stood, before an encampment. We all had been assigned at least one, our search had lead us across the land, mapping out each and every spot. It would take take too long to target each one, so instead it was agreed that we each would tackle some on our own. After all they were just bandits. Their peripherial vision wasn't too bad, a trio noticing him. Placing their boxes down, a smirk on their faces as they unseathed their weapons. Patting the palm of their hands with the tip of their blades they had decided to interrogate me, "So who do we have here? A hero?" honestly they had pegged me all wrong. I couldn't help, but to smirk at their assumptions. "What are you going to save the near-by town?" a lankier one asked. I remained silent, my identity hidden from behind my mask. Honestly, what was the point of answering such silly questions? My staff held in my hand, a devious smirk had been plastered on my face before I shot a spear of dark energy at them. Shocking them to their core, filling them with only the finest quality of dread. They sniveled on the ground their weapon dropping infront of them. The other two had been puzzled, why had their comrade been reduced to nothing but a baby? They were also easily dispatched. Slicing off the head of one of them with a kunai, I made my way deeper within the camp. "This is the fate of those who decide to oppose me! Heed my warning.." The bandits had been moving a haul, stopping with a look of pure shock which quickly turned into anger. They were pretty numerous, but their lack of skills hadn't filled the gap between them. Raising my hand I had conjured up a multitude of spears, amazed by my act. I could taste the hesistation, merely looking at the beads of sweat running down the sides of some of the bandits had caused me pure joy. "If any of you move, I will kill you where you stand. Swear loyalty to me, and you will be spared from death. I will not tell you to change your ways. Quite the opposite, I seek to bring more organization to your ways. We will not stop being 'bandits'. We'll simply be more efficient.~" The bandits were confused, did they dare attack? Their leader decided to step out with a grunt, dressed in a finer hide armor than the others. His weapon had also been of fine quality, "Do you really think we'll join your forces?!" he bellowed. I could tell that his ranks felt safer when he was around, their uncertainty had been shaved when he deicded to speak. I swiftly sent two of my spears, he had been able to deflect one, but the second one had pierced his chest. Blood gushing out. It was a fine sight to behold, as the other bandits looked in shock. Their fear being solidified. "Bow.." I spoke, having to keep up with a schedule. They looked at me, mouths still agape. "Bow...I won't repeat myself.." their leader had been removed, biting their lips one by one they began to bow in respect. With each one two more one begin to comply. It had been easy, assigning a co-leader while leaving to watch over things. "If you fail, I'll kill you." Of course they wouldn't dare to double cross someone who had just assumed authority in an instant. "I wonder how Ushinawa is fairing against his opponents..?" I thought while journeying to the next few encampments, taking them over just as easy as the last.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The journey would be tough for anyone. Storms whipping up every now and again. However would one be able to make it to such a secluded, and far out place? His quest for knowledge was unsatiable, he needed to know. He wanted to know more! Everything in this world was at his finger tips. This was what he needed. With each step, it drew him closer to his destination. One of which he wanted to be at.

He could tell, he needed not to blink. It felt as if he had been walking for an eternity, but he had stopped thinking about time. There was no point any longer. He was out of time's grasp, if he could smile you would see one plastered on his face.* - Sun Sep 06 14:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Burying something in the sand was quite easy. Placing the box down, he began to bury it as such. Making sure the sand would eventually cover it. He'd help out piling a bit back on before any evidence of it's existence had been washed away by the gentle winds that would cause sand to blow overtop akin to snow.* - Sun Sep 06 14:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Walked onto the scene, staying quiet he hadn't want to disrupt the flow of whatever had been taking place. The position of an observer was more than enough for the time being. Of course, he hadn't been trying to hide himself. A thought had formed in his head, 

"I wonder how I should greet them? I've never been here before so their customs may be different.."* - Sun Sep 06 16:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Taking note of the inquiry, he decided to speak up, "Greetings, my name isn't as important right now. You conversation on the other hand piques my interest. If you would be so kind as to allow me to indulge on it a bit longer. It would mean a lot.." his voice had been gravel-esque, and raspy, while the pitch had been quite low.* - Sun Sep 06 16:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Tilted his head, noting Orakuru's proximity 

"It appears you know who I'm looking for.."* - Sun Sep 06 16:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Shaking his head, he couldn't help but to chuckle. He hadn't seen a fight in quite a while. His body began to rattle with excitement from his mouth escaped a set of words that were more akin to some sort of foreign language. With each movement of his jaw he had made his way over towards a lesser populated area. His sight placed upon Tethys, yet he remained at a distance. For the time being it didn't appear as if he was going to make any sudden movements.

Eka cikha ke nice eka phiiga atithi samsa leta hai. Eka krima juri ko parikrta. Pratispardhi geraja pichale eka jurmana lagaya sucaka darda hota hai. Eka nicoaa ke khilapha atirikta caaaanoa. Puja nasta. Nase mea pratyaya anandamaya prabhava ke piche bolati hai." had been uttered in a low dulcet tone.* - Sun Sep 06 18:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His mutterings continued. He had clasped his hands, before slowly parting them, a rod of energy beginning to form while the distance between his hands grew. One may have thought that this was some sort of thunderbolt, but it wasn't! Grabbing a hold of the shaft, he had wielded his staff the veil of energy dispersed before it revealed a normal item. His attention still focused upon Tethys the time had come. Something may have felt different in Tethys the moment his energy had been concentrated. His legs would begin to lose their strength the end result eventually if not immediately forcing him kneel.

(Dark Bringer, Dark Apprentice, and..)* - Sun Sep 06 18:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Let out a sigh, the pitch of his voice raising,

 "I do ask the both of you to stop such a squabble. I can't have either of you killing eachother. It wouldn't be beneficial for anyone. Not even for myself. If you can both put aside whatever past you have for the time being. It would be greatly appreciated!~"* - Sun Sep 06 19:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Grumbled, 

"Ushin..do not continue this. This isn't the time, nor place. You're not only putting these people in danger, but you're risking all they have worked for. Where is your honor?!" contrary to his appearance he had sounded more-so like an upstanding individual.
* - Sun Sep 06 19:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The fight had seemed to be calming down, his part was done. Releasing the hex placed upon Tethys, the strange feeling would surprisingly disappear returning the strength back to his legs.* - Sun Sep 06 19:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Scratched the back of his head. Trudging off, he headed towards the hospital. Eventually learning Aiyana's room number. He'd approach opening the door without knocking of course. Walking in, he'd simply crouch near her bed side.

"You got messed up.."* - Sun Sep 06 21:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Chuckled, 

"You're not really that stupid? That guy could've killed us both."* - Sun Sep 06 21:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Shook his head, following up with a shrug.

"How can you do anything in your state. Maybe you should get stronger?"* - Sun Sep 06 21:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) What was even going on anymore. Who would know? The screams of people refusing to join up with Edge, and his forces may have been heard throughout the village. If anything this had been making Nigen all hot and bothered. "War" was truly beautiful. Following along, he had kept quiet for the time being. He did want to watch if crap was about to hit the ceiling.
* - Sun Sep 06 22:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had been covered from top to bottom.* - Sun Sep 06 22:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Shrugs, 

"You should be thanking me for watching over her.."* - Sun Sep 06 22:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Began to walk off, 

"I'll be back. Do stay safe, Sister.~"* - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Relocated his box from the sand. He had dusted it off before placing it safely within his clutches. He'd then begin to head off towards the direction of Konohagakure to see what had been going down there. 

The sand blowing up against him had been a nuisance, but nonetheless he must continue his trek. Eventually he reached a suitable distance to where he could bury his box. Digging out a nicely sized whole by repeatedly firing off bolts, he would then bury it. Covering any scorch marks that may have persisted with dirt, and grass. He'd then smooth it out, before putting another layer of grass just to make things right.* - Sun Sep 06 23:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Detects sometin wrong with de eagle. He ain't go no sensory perk doe. Don't ask for one. Even with that, he decided to show himself walking closer to the gates. The Amegakure soldiers had been piling up their defenses, or something. Did that matter to him? No. He didn't care one bit. This guy right here was a seven foot tall japanese basketball player. Not really, though. In actuality, he had been of average height for a japanese man. His mask hid his face, he was truly a shy being. 

Coughing, before raising his voice attempting to get the attention of the people waiting.

"Greetings! I'd like to know if Zetsumo is in. Could anyone please tell me if he's taking any guests?"* - Sun Sep 06 23:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Ski-daddled to the right, he wasn't about to get hit by that barrage of nonsense. Even so, he needed to get the low-down on the good deals. If only there had been someone to talk to. Someone who wasn't fighting....but WHO?* - Sun Sep 06 23:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Scratched the back of his head. He had decided to start counting the corpses. It was a job, and someone had to do it.* - Mon Sep 07 02:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Arrived on scene, stepping through the rubble before muttering at an audible tone, 

"Honey, I'm home.~" he paused..maybe he had been waiting for a bit of laughter akin to that of a laugh track. Of course not, that'd be weird. His eyes gazing at the destruction before him. He shivered where he stood, this place has seen better days..."* - Mon Sep 07 02:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Coughed, he had wanted information. The only person that seemed to be alive was Jiki. Attempting to get his attention he'd begin to cough again, and again.

"Hey! *Cough* What's going on with the war? *Cough*?!" for some reason there had been an ample amount of confidence in his tone. Almost as if he had enjoyed all of this destruction, and chaos.

Here's some ambience for the situation:

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Began to jot down a quick message on a small scroll. Wrapping it around his messenger bird's leg. He'd set it off, it began to flap it's wings taking off towards his men. Eventually they would get the message, reading it as so.

"I'll need you to bring horses, and carts. We're on corpse clean-up.." The bandits began to mobilize not wanting to keep Nigen waiting. Of course, it would take a few hours for them to arrive, but when they did the clean-up would commence.* - Mon Sep 07 05:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Skipped onto the scene, almost tripping he caught himself. Looking around to see if anyone saw, he'd simply play it off..* - Tue Sep 08 00:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Here's the ambience:

https://youtu.be/wjNtB5g70ic* - Tue Sep 08 00:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Sighed while shaking his head, "Really, what am I going to do with you guys? Can't you sit down, and discuss your problems out? I-..it pains me to see you all doing battle. The sweat dripping down your muscular bodies, your muscles tensing with each passing moment. Not knowing if the next move will be the demise of your opponent's, or your own...~ J-..just thinking about it strikes fear into my heart. What happens if I lose one of you to such a fight?! I-..I couldn't bear it! his pitch had escalated he had been trying to sound like a typical heroine.

"P-..please..just..stop.."* - Tue Sep 08 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He couldn't help, but chuckle. Everyone seemingly mobilizing as if they had some sort of zord to hop into. Of course they didn't, they lacked any sort of finesse. His pitch had been distorted as he called out to the Raikage, 

"Lord Raikage! What are you going to do about this?! Is this not your territory now? Have these people no manners?! Honestly, not even asking you if it is allowed to do battle? They are disrespecting not only you, but the title, and oath you swore upon!" his acting had been great, would any fruits come from it? Only time would tell.* - Tue Sep 08 01:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His pitch had bounced around from medium to higher octaves.

"That's enough. This fight at first had some sort of appeal. Now it's simply how many of you can attack all at once. Of course, that's not necessarily a bad thing. In another situation, I'd be all for it. If you all are so afraid that you can not allow your Mizukage to fight on his own, he's already admitted defeat. Honestly, why would he need the help of his men to fight two unkown shinobi? It's pathetic, if anything this should be counted as a loss! Do you have no shame?!"* - Tue Sep 08 02:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Shaking his head, he knew not of what had been going on from here forth. A rabbit seemingly coming from out of nowhere from his perspective. It was truly something else, 

"Lord Raikage! What are you going to do about this?! Is this not your territory now? Have these people no manners?! Honestly, not even asking you if it is allowed to do battle? They are disrespecting not only you, but the title, and oath you swore upon!"* - Tue Sep 08 04:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Chuckled, he had begun to approach the two fighters. They had appeared to be downed. His steps were quick, it may have appeared as if he was preparing to finish them off perhaps? One may have thought that, but his words did state otherwise. Of course he wasn't as fast as the two combatants, but it wouldn't have taken him long to reach their immediate area.
(Speed tier 2)* - Tue Sep 08 05:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The sand had been fast. Faster than he had anticipated, of course there was no point in resisting such a bind, the sand wrapping around his body sealing off his movements. From beneath his mask he spoke, 

"I do not know what you are doing, but this does not set quite well with me after the respectable service I did you." he had clearly been talking to Tetsumi, his tone was low almost as if he had been accusing him of a treacherous filled act. Glancing over towards Violet, as she spoke her nonsense.

"I do not care about the collection of those artifacts. This fight was a sham, and nothing should be touched here. All items shall return to their current owners."* - Tue Sep 08 05:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He felt the tension of the sand pressing against his body. He knew he wasn't being given any room to move. The blue gaze that had emitted from behind his Irisless mask. 

"Do you really mean to hand over the blade which belongs to that younger man? This could be seen as a hostile action. You're only going to create more problems with this route. Are you sure this is the path you want to take?"* - Tue Sep 08 05:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He hadn't responded immediately to Tetsumi's statements. If anything he had been disgusted. That thought process-no it had more-so been a single word that kept rearing it's ugly head into almost every conversation. Letting out a sigh, he'd tried to hold back his fury.

"You talk of taking risks, but you give more power to a single village. They wanted that blade for a reason. We know not of their reasoning, all we know is that they are willing to kill for them. Would people go to such lengths for a normal blade? Your talk of peace is nothing, but a pipe dream. You should accept war. The sooner you do, maybe the time in which you suffer will be shortened. This was the wrong decision, this fight shouldn't have had a winner. You've given the win over to them. If they are your allies..so be it. Kill me, embrace your truth.."* - Tue Sep 08 05:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Wasn't sure how to feel. His salt was quite high due to Jiki's intervention. Thinking about it, he dismissed the ordeal as just an exchange for the information. Chuckling, he'd attempt to leave Tetsumi with a gift

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) A fire in the mansion. These two people may have been geniuses. There were tons of scrolls located within this place. Years of information which had been collected, and preserved to one day be used again for whatever means. It annoyed him to no limit on how easy-going they had been with their skirmish in such a confined area.

Still the blaze had already started to grow out of control, and he lacked any sort of water techniques. This wasn't a battle that he could win. With that he glanced over at Seisuke, 

"You should leave, before you're injured.." his words may have been taken to hold some sort of concern to them. He soon began to head out of the burning building.* - Tue Sep 08 20:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Grunting, he couldn't understand why Seisuke had been dawdling. From beneath his cloak stretched out his hand. Attempting to latch onto his collar, tugging on it he tried his best to direct him.

"You wouldn't enjoy being trapped in here any longer. Not with those flames, you may perish. I do suggest that you distance yourself from this area.." his suggestion had haste to it. The insignia that had caught his eye from before had been placed within the forefront of his mind whenever his eyes came across this boy.* - Tue Sep 08 20:35:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His head slowly turning towards Yan with a fleeting creak.
