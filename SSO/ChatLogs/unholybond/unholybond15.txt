<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He remained silent, his sight fully placed upon Ichiro. He hadn't necessarily knew Ichiro's area of expertise. This would've been a potentially educational test for Nigen.  Following his movements he had easily noted that Ichiro had decided to close the distance between them. 

*Maybe a taijutsu user? He could be just shy to use his main techniques...* he began to hypothesize while backpeddaling apparently not wanting him to get too close.* - Sat Oct 31 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) A smile had been placed on his face from behind his mask. "Well now..that's different.." he muttered before relying on his reflexes to maneuver around the spear. So far he had only been relying on his defense, he hadn't been satisfied. 
His mind focusing on the battle at hand he spoke, 

"Come on...Ichiro-kun..fight me like you'd want to kill me. Imagine that I was the person that killed a loved one. You have a better goal in life than protecting this Ugly Witch for the rest of your life!"* - Sat Oct 31 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had been keeping track this whole time trying to mark down Ichiro's tendencies and responses. His facial expressions, and his over-all posture in response to whatever Nigen may have blurted out at the time. It wouldn't have been too much fun if all he did was avoid. Attempting to block this next swing with the same arm that had been closest to the spear. He would've been pushed to the side the spear putting pressure against his arm forcing him to roll in an attempt to avoid another follow-up strike while trying to properly rebound. He had bluntly wanted to feel Ichiro's strength.* - Sat Oct 31 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Pass. I'm watchingm y calorie intake. - Sat Oct 31 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: ........... - Sat Oct 31 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Barely rising to his feet he had been met with a swift, using his other arm to shave off some of the damage. It did however force him back, using this to his advantage he had went with the flow attempting to distance himself from Ichiro even if it had meant rolling within the grass. Chuckling he had happened to pick up on Asteroth's comment. 

"Watching your weight? Are you taking my suggestions?~ Hahahahahahaha!" one might've thought that Nigen hadn't been taking this whole sparring session seriously at all.* - Sat Oct 31 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) In truth he had been paying attention to the fight. Mainly for his own reasons, breaking out of his roll, the spear thrown had been heading straight for him. He had simply held out his hand. A thin film had been erected out from the surface. Smaller than when he had utilized it previously. This had in-turn strengthened it allowing him to block/deflect the spear while he got back onto his feet. Within a moment, Ichiro had tried to capitalize on a potential moment of openess. Switching to his free hand, he had tried to palm Ichiro's knee. Normally one would use this to exchange in a power struggle. In contrast, Nigen had tried to use Ichiro's strength against him. Pushing off of his knee in hopes to distance himself once again.

"Come on, Ichiro-kun..is this how you act when facing someone who has killed your loved ones?"* - Sat Oct 31 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) The ability to form constructs out of whatever that substance had been intrigued him. *What is it made out of? How much can he produce in on sitting?* these questions had been bouncing through his mind. All the while he had been moving away from him, attempting to avoid his strikes with relative ease for some reason Nigen hadn't been fatigued in the slightest.

"Come now, is this how you want to perform in-front of your crush? I wonder if the purest form of anger wells up from within knowing that she won't even look your way. Perhaps you're more bothered by the fact that I get to touch that Old Hag?~" he had wanted to bring out more rage from Ichiro. * - Sat Oct 31 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: The only way to fight is with bloodlust.~ - Sat Oct 31 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had felt as if Ichiro had been holding something back. Categorizing him as 'reserved' forced his hand. Feeling the need to push him forward, air around them had been some-what thick. He could feel the intent to kill from each of Ichiro's strikes. Sadly there had been something missing, as if he hadn't been fighting with all of his emotions on the line. He had continued to dodge his hands remaining at his sides. 

"Ichiro-kun..don't you want to impress your 'Q-..Queen'?" fumbling with the word just to emphasize how outlandish he thought it had been. "If you don't hurry up, she'll get bored. Is this all you can do? Are you sure there isn't a big finish that you want to go with?"* - Sat Oct 31 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hmph.. - Sat Oct 31 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Tilted his head, watching as she started to walk off.

"Eh...what do you mean he won? Are you just angry because your boy toy is better looking than you are?"* - Sat Oct 31 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: ..... - Sat Oct 31 02:01:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Sat down, unraveling the scroll. He had decided to pass the time by reading. It had been a pretty nice day. The contents of the scroll hadn't appeared to be too difficult. They also weren't out of his reach. He had just needed a bit of time to get the hang of it.* - Sat Oct 31 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He hadn't been satisfied. His time reading tomes were much more difficult in comparison to this low-grade technique. If he had wanted to get anywhere in his lifetime. He had needed to learn all that he could while he had still be young. Age was definitely a cruel mistress. Reviewing the scroll once more he had begun to practice the incantation to himself. Muttering it almost as if it had been a hymn.* - Sat Oct 31 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Had taken this time lean against a tree. The same scroll in hand, he had been ready to read it once more. His eyes scanning as if they had been some sort of machine was quite promising. To anyone not trained in the ways this may have appeared to be just squiggles on a sheet, but to him it had been fully legible.* - Sat Oct 31 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Taking another crack at it. He hadn't been satisfied not until the full aspects of the technique had been within his grasp. Once again, this time he had focused more on fragments of the incantation. Hoping this would allow him to get it down better.* - Sat Oct 31 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His practice has been gaining steady results. This hadn't been good enough for someone of his caliber. Needing to get this technique down by this day. He had dedicated himself to toiling away making sure each incantation had been known. Repeating it to himself, even he did make some sort of mistake when reciting the incantation. Flustered he tried his best to calm down his bloodthirst leaking out from frustration.* - Sat Oct 31 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) What was this? he thought. Nigen couldn't understand why this scroll had been impeding him to this degree. Sure he has had difficulties in the past, but that was when he was still a fledgling. He should by now be able to decipher much more at a faster rate!* - Sat Oct 31 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Why was he lagging behind her? If she was able to learn this spell, he was without a doubt qualified to do so. Focusing even more on the fact that Asteroth had knew this skill he dedicated his full attention to learning it. Scanning each individual character, and mouthing them out he had been determined to say the least.* - Sat Oct 31 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He hadn't been in the best of moods. This scroll appearing to me more cryptic than he had initially thought. Why couldn't everything be simple? Things becoming more difficult was the bane of most. Something stirred up inside of him, the need for a challenge. This had been it, to a degree. Burying his face into the scroll he carried on.* - Sat Oct 31 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Continued studying onward. He had wanted to get the technique down sooner rather than later. His eyes scanned the text with haste. He had repeated this over, and over. Results varying from only miniscule portions beind understood, or sometimes larger parts.* - Sat Oct 31 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Sighed he had attempted once more to decipher the scroll. This hadn't been necessarily hurting his spirit. It drove him forward, he had yearned to experience the knowledge that this scroll has to offer.* - Sat Oct 31 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Continued reading the scroll. He had a lot to learn from it, and had wanted to get it down before it had gotten a bit too late. Scanning the incantation time, and time again. He had made sure that each part was properly recited before continuing on with the next bit.* - Sat Oct 31 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He hadn't been satisfied with just this level of knowledge. He had recited the incantation time, and time again. Making sure to review every portion at-least twice. He had wanted to make sure that this had been paying off. Surprisingly it had been more, and more of the content was actually understandable.* - Sat Oct 31 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Continued reading he could taste the knowledge on the tip of his tongue. His thirst for knowledge wasn't quenched. He continued to struggle wading through the water of incantations. Making his way to finally understand the truth to such a jutsu.* - Sat Oct 31 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) It was so close! He needed just a little bit more. Memorizing a majority of the incantation besides the last two lines. He hadn't needed to look at the top portion of the scroll anymore. Focusing solely on the bottom. This had been his moment. He could feel the ability slowly beginning to sink into his being. The ecstacy that he had felt once fully understanding the power.* - Sat Oct 31 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He had finally understood the technique a smirk plastered on his face. He began to recite the incantation. Pointing his hand out towards a tree. Within a moment several dark spikes had been conjured from thin air. Piercing the tree with the utmost intentions on stopping whatever movement it may have posed.* - Sat Oct 31 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Holding out his hand he had noticed a small bird perched on a tree branch. He knew that his technique wouldn't have damaged it physically. After all he did have a soft spot for nature. Wanting to see if he could catch something a bit smaller he had began the incantation muttering it softly so not as to scare away his target. With a snap of his finger he had conjured several spikes of darkness which had pierced through the bird with ease. Surprisingly it had been unharmed, struggling to move around but it had been forced in place chirping repeatedly. Within a moment Nigen had released his bindings feeling as if that had been enough torment for the bird itself.* - Sat Oct 31 23:28:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) His troops had begun to line up infront of him. Scratching his head he had reverted somewhat back to his more normal persona. His crazy talk eliminated completely from his tendency. It was as if he had been a different person. "

For the time being the whereabouts of the Giant Slug are unknown. For now we will begin scouting for it's location. We'll spread out in groups of five, when any group finds signs of that beauty. You are not to engage, you are to immediately report it to my group. We will then send notifications to every other group, from there we will meet up, and converge on it's trail." his men nodded in agreement before preparing their bodies moving in tandem pairing up with whomever they felt safest with. Before long there were ten groups of five. Nigen having explained that he had last spotted the beast retreating northwest of their last area of encounter. From that point they began to fan out.* - Sun Nov  1 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Stumbled onto the scene he had been humming a tune to himself, breaking into song for a moment while walking around. The mist rolling in had struck him as strange, yet he hadn't paid much mind to it. He had been tailing the other two for the mission. He had been a lonely duckling only wanting a bit of fun. 

"Yura..yura to.~" he clearly hadn't known what was going on.* - Sun Nov  1 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) He could've guessed that a fight was going on from the screams, but he couldn't exactly pinpoint where they were coming from due to the mist. With his steady movement he would soon be able to make out what seemed to be a wall or door of some sort. Made of metal it wouldn't have easily been pierced. Not being able to see how tall it was just be a first glance didn't really phase him. Sighing..he simply concentrated before he had begun to rise up into the air. As if little baby cherubs had been raising him up from his position. He had attempted to scale the construct with relative ease.* - Sun Nov  1 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ricky(Lordlol45) says: Yes - Sun Nov  1 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Having scaled and infiltrated the enemy encampment. He had touched down on the the structure he had looked for any wandering people. He hadn't actually known if they were targets or not. He just wanted a bit of fun. Holding out his hand he had allowed a bit of energy that he had built up to be released. Multiple bolts of dark energy had been released. Screams most likely echoed out within the mist hopefully causing more confusion.* - Sun Nov  1 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) After dispatching his group of opponents. They had yielded nothing of interest. He actually hadn't been informed of anything they were looking for. He simply just wanted to murder people for the hell of it. He continued on his ramage sending bolts of energy towards the grunts. He only had needed his weakest spells for them. He could only wait for the mist to disperse if he had wanted to locate Ichiro, and Mizumi.
* - Sun Nov  1 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Seeing the the forces had finally thinned out in the immediate area. A jolt hit him one that hadn't been quite enjoyable. In-fact it had sent him into a slight rage. Glancing over towards the north he had easily sensed it. "Holy Magic"...he grumbled. He had started to head towards it wanting to see who was the cause of such an atrocity.* - Sun Nov  1 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) Making his way, he stopped at the barrier's edge. He glared towards the men that had stood from behind. They most likely had felt comfortable from within the safe haven of their holy protection. Raising his right hand towards the sky, he had simply began to concentrate. Focusing his hatred, and his knowledge of the dark arts he had decided to use a higher technique. He had allowed his energy to release a multitude of spears had been conjured from thin air. With the subtle movement of a finger they had began to hit against the barrier.* - Sun Nov  1 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) With the same hand he had formed a shield, defending himself from counter-attack of projectiles. He had decided to retreat for the time being. His eyes bounced from each being from behind the barrier in sight. Remembering their faces for the next time they would have the pleasure of seeing eachother. Holy Magic wasn't something he wanted to experience at the moment.* - Sun Nov  1 05:01:39 2015
