<html><body bgcolor = black><b><center><font size = 5 color=silver>Kirigakure: During the recent years, Kirigakure's kage has been more and more distant to the public. The council had been keeping the order, restoring parts of the village, controlling the military, and handling all shinobi business. The long term growing 'childrens army' has grown to irritate the general civilian public. Protests and small riots have began to break out at public executions, stating that the child army is deranged, corrupt, and even 'monsters'.<br><br>

Sunagakure: The village flourishes and despite having changed kage's two times in only a short period of time, it seems the village is prospering at the top of the food chain. Due to their prosperity, Sunagakure has struck a 'baby boomer' generation.<br><br>

Kumogakure: With thier newly found independence, the village has began to grow and seems to hold strong morals for honor and strength in family and numbers. How long will their growth and 'wholesome' village remain in their control?<br><br>

Konoha: The village seems to be the weakest link in the chain of great villages, struggling to grow and prosper under their young new kage through the recent years. There is constant rumors about if the new kage will do anything to benefit the village any time soon, and the growing threat of necromancers and gouls seems to be a terror that mocks her very authority over the shinobi. <br><br>
