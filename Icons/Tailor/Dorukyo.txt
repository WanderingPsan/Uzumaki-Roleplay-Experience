<b>Profession:</b> The members of this clan have gained the ability to utilize a strange Kekkei Genkai. This "Henkan" allows them to use the ability of spheres which their family has gathered throughout the generations that have passed and infused them with mystical energy.
<br><br>

<b>Transformation Release:</b> The Transformation Release allows the user to unlock the hidden potential of these items and absorb them, granting them the ability which comes with it. They can also use this for casual affairs, such as changing from a ceremonial garb to a simple attire.<br>
Note: This grants them the ability to use it, but not the knowledge on how to use it. For example, if one were to unlock a sphere which obtained the abilities of a samurai, they would be transformed in the attire of a samurai and be given one of their swords, but lack the knowledge and ability to properly utilize the armor and blade.<br><br>

<b>Strengths:</b><br>
•  The members of this clan are very well versed and are known throughout the ninja world for being master generalists due to their wide variety of choices.<br>
•  The spheres they carry around are small and portable, giving them the oppurtunity to use them with ease and transition between transformations.<br>
•  The sphere gives the user whatever clothing, armor, weaponry and abilities that the transformation state had previously.<br>
•  The Dorukyo have naturally high chakra and stamina reserves, required in order to use the variety of transformations with ease.<br><br>

<b>Weaknesses:</b><br>
• If the spheres are damaged, broken or shattered the members are unable to restore or utilize it any longer. <br>
• The members of the clan are very vulnerable during their transformations. (1 rp round)<br>
• They must learn how to utilize each transformation state and have little to no information given to them on how to do so.<br>
• Each transformation gives them an alternate personality, and the members are often prone to transitioning between these personalities.<br><br>

<b>History:</b> The Dorukyo were a proud and noble clan located inside of the Kirigakre no Sato were known in the past for their abilities in Fuuinjutsu. As time passed, they stumbled upon a new idea that would diversify them further from the stereotypical shinobi. This idea being the choice of profession. Rather then remaining loyal to one profession since a young age and only beginning to branch off to a scarce few when you became more skilled, they wished to have the choice then and there.<br><br>

The first few centuries of attempts inevitably failed, leading to the death of many shinobi of the clan and giving it a more pessimistic outlook on life. Although, only several decades ago have they came to a conclusion that they can utilize their Fuuinjutsu to seal abilities and items inside of these custom made spheres. Through the practice and decades that have passed, now in the modern day shinobi world, the members of the Dorukyo clan and finally ready to begin their training and experimentation.<br><br>

<center><font size=8 color=red>The Tale of Urzog Ugrog</font></center>
<font size = 2 color=black>
Urzog Ugrog was a simple Daemon from the shattered realm of Grandeur the Sage of Six Paths, and ancestor of all shinobi. When Grandeur was sealed away, the plane of existence that had come into being from the backlash of Grandeur's power began to shatter and meld with the physical realm. Urzog was only one of very many creatures that was lucky enough to move into the physical realm, if even for a short amount of time. This is his story.
<br><br>
Urzog's initial moment of consciousness was a very bright and shining one. It was so bright that he would never forget it. The brightness was a mixture of the energies of Grandeur's realm shunting him into existence and the fire he landed in. Urzog was a small, humanoid being that looked more like a cat than a human. His "birth" into the physical realm was directly into a roaring campfire, around which four individuals were seated.
<br><br>
"Whoah! What the hey!" The grey-haired male sitting next to the fire exclaims as he backs away from the fire that the strange looking Urzog had just fallen into.
<br><br>
"Oh my god it's a cat!" The blue-haired female screams while jumping up.
<br><br>
Urzog rolls out of the fire and hisses at it. He looks at the two people standing there and turns his head to the side. "Durug Dra Nor!" He exclaims in the ancient Daemon language of Grandeur's realm. The two individuals just stand there staring at the cat, freaked out of their minds but also intruiged.  They both begin to slowly approach him initially but the girl stops moving and the male continues forwards.
<br><br>
"H-hello there little guy." The male says extending his right hand. "I-I'm Gin..And this is Nerine." He says pointing at himself before motioning backwards to the girl who was with him. "C-can you understand us?" He asks Urzog, his right hand still extended as if to shake.
<br><br>
Urzog suddenlly leaps forwards without even a twitch of warning and clamps down onto Gin's hand. The small Daemon drains a small amount of Gin's blood and drinks it down greedily. He lets go of his hand and suddenlly stands up on his hind legs. Urzog's tail wraps around his waist and he sort of adjusts his weight on his legs before beginning to speak, this time in English.
<br><br>
"Hello Gin. I am Urzog Ugrog. I am a new consciousness, birthed from the Realm of Grandeur." He says bowing deeply.
<br><br>
Both Gin and Nerine suddenlly look extremely shocked. "Gr-Grandeur!?" They yell. The two of them suddenlly go on the offensive. Gin claps his hands together and a spear appears there, the spearhead was barbed on either side of the head, a chain was attached to the base and ran up the length and down his sleeve, assumably attached somewhere therein. Nerine reaches behind her and grabs two scrolls attached to her back, she lets them fall open where two large seals were placed. "Kuchiyose!" She exclaims as an African Elephant and a Rhinoceros appear directly behind her, crushing two trees. They stand at the ready, watching Urzog.
<br><br>
"I am Gin Toyotomi and she is Nerine Lyzerg, two of the seven survivors of Grandeur's destruction of Konohagakure no Sato and you are a spawn of Grandeur, therefore our enemy. Prepare to face retribution!" As Gin says this Urzog's eyes suddenlly flash bright red.
<br><br>
"Poor children...You're only two of seven...That must be a sad existence....Allow me to free you of your pain." Urzog says as his face gains a look of sadness. His eyes were still shining a bright crimson color, but beyond that he only looked sad. He raises his paws upwards towards the sky, two bright white orbs of energy appear there and coalesce into two clear, crystal orbs.
<br><br>
"Henkan: Empty Skies." Urzog says as one of the two orbs shoot from his paws and fly directly for the duo. The female is struck in the chest by the orb and seems to disintegrate as only a fine shower of sparks is left behind as she and her two summons dissappear. Gin turns around and yells in anguish. He turns back to Urzog, tears flowing from his eyes.
<br><br>
"What in the Hell did you just do to her you monster!?" He exclaims while rushing towards Urzog. The male begins to strike out with his spear, making wide, deadly arcs with each strike. His spear was flowing with his chakra which caused cutting trails of white light to follow each strike.
<br><br>
Urzog shakes his head. "I have only released her from her physical form and given her an eternal life. As I shall do for you." Urzog says as the other orb flies out from his paw. Gin swings at the orb as it gets close, his spear strikes it hard, but as it does so, he too disintegrates into a shower of sparks, leaving nothing behind but the clear orb. Urzog walks over to each of the orbs and picks them up. "I will only take a portion...Just what I need." He says as he picks them up. "Henkan: Transform." He says as his own Daemon energies flow into the orbs. The energy draws at the essence stored there and with a flash of blue light, Urzog's features suddenlly seem less like a cat's. He takes on all of the physical features of Gin, the male whom he had just seemingly sealed away into the orb.
<br><br>
"Hmm...Clayr is to the North." He says as he turns around and walks forwards a few steps. "I'll just..Set up a barrier for these two until I return." He says in Gin's voice as he raises his hands. Nothing happens. "Hmm, it would seem I cannot use my abilities as this individual..That is fine." He says as he raises a paw. "Henkan: Revert." He says before turning back into himself. "Henkan: Solidarity of the Soul." He says as he throws his paws forwards. A barrier of pure energy is erected around the place where Nerine's Orb was sitting. A small moat forms around the shield before the trees in the area seem to grow wild and out of control. "That will do for now." Urzog says as he walks towards the North.
<br><br>
Urzog crosses into the area just East of where Konohagakure used to be, he walks to the northernmost part of this region and comes upon a small hut. Holding onto Gin's orb he transforms into him. Urzog then walks up to the hut and knocks on the door.
<br><br>
"Who is it!?" A voice calls out from inside. It was obviously a woman's, and it didn't seem to happy to have a visitor.
<br><br>
"Cl-Clayr it's me." Urzog says in Gin's voice, his reaction being the one that his body was telling him he should have to this woman. With a sudden whoosh of air, the door of the hut opens, standing there is a dark-skinned woman with deep purple hair.
<br><br>
"What do you want Gin? Where is Nerine?" She asks while looking the male in the eyes. Normally nothing would get to Urzog, especially a simple human speaking to him like this, but because of his soul link with tthe Orb of Gin, he was experiencing existence as if he were Gin himself. 
<br><br>
"R-Riri is sleeping..She told me to bring this to you, we found it." He says as he reaches his hand into the backpouch on his back. "Henka-" He begins to whisper before stopping. "Damn, I can't use my powers as this boy." Urzog thinks before frowning. "Oh my it seems I dropped it, will you wait here?" He says while suddenlly jetting away from the hut.
<br><br>
"That kid's always been flighty..." Clayr remarks as she walks back inside, closing the door. As soon as the door is closed good, Urzog ducks behind a tree and pulls out Gin's Orb. "Henkan: Revert." He says as he returns to his normal feline self. "I guess I can just make the rest of the orbs and leave them in my pouch...I won't even waste time transforming." He says as he holds his paws up and facing each other. "Henkan: Multi-Clear Skies." He says as five Orbs appear in his paws."This will work." He says as he walks back towards Clayr's hut.
<br><br>
Urzog walks up to the door and knocks on it.
<br><br>
"About time you got back Gin!" Clayr yells out as she opens the door swiftly. 
<br><br>
"Here we go Miss Clayr Ouendan." Urzog says as he pushes an orb directly into the woman's chest, it sits in her cleavage for a moment as she stares down at the cat-like humanoid. 
<br><br>
"Just what the hell do you think you're do-" She began to say before disappearing in a burst of sparks, just like Gin and Nerine.
<br><br>
"Good. The sadness and pain that Gin and Nerine felt will not continue for much longer. I will steal away all of the survivors of Grandeurs Destruction and save them from their sorrow!"  Urzog exclaims as he places Clayr's Orb on a table in her house before locking the door and leaving. 
<br><br>
Urzog makes his way back to the barrier where he left Nerine's orb and phases through it. He places Gin's orb next to the girl's and bows. He then turns around and makes his way towards the desert to the west.
<br><br>
Urzog makes it to the desert in a very short amount of time and just starts walking. The Feline Humanoid makes his way to the deepest, dryest part of the desert. He walks up to a small hut and before he can knock on the door a young man walks up behind him, a zanbatou drawn and held at the ready. "What business do you have here monster?" The male asks as he stares at Urzog from behind.
<br><br>
"I am Urzog Ugrog, friend of Gin, Nerine, and Clayr." He says smiling and turning around. In reality, Urzog was lying, he was lying very hard. But deep down and intrinsically, he believed what he had just said. The space around the male staring him down bristled for a moment. 
<br><br>
"Well you're not lying, I guess I can trust you." He says sheathing his large blade. "Hello, I'm Ma-" He begins to say.
<br><br>
"You're Maxi Nomaru!" Urzog says smiling. "Gin told me all about you!" He says, his cat-like face smiling. Maxi looks rather astonished at the fact that the being before him was more cat than human. "I'm Urzog Ugrog. I am a Cat from the Land of Paws!" He exclaims, waving his hands in the air. Suddenlly Maxi places his right hand on his right temple. 
<br><br>
"Don't lie to me, I'll know when you do." He says while focusing his chakra. A small stone at the base of his neck, in the back, glows a faint yellow glow as he lowers his sensing field to just encompass himself and Urzog. Urzog looks rather confounded for a moment, he knew he was going to have to be really sneaky to get Maxi to accept his saving grace.
<br><br>
"I have a gift for you Maxi." Urzog says as he reaches into his pouch and pulls out a single Orb. "This is a gift I have for you! It will prevent all negative feelings!" Urzog says smiling rather hard.
<br><br>
Maxi reaches out to take the Orb and shudders. His field suddenlly drains out and fails him. "Wh-what just happe-" He begins to say as Urzog pushes the orb deep into Maxi's grasp. Maxi's face has a look of betrayal on it for a split second. Right before he is turned into a shower of sparks, he sees Gin's visage take over Urzog's form before he enters the orb.
<br><br>
"Yes Yes! Only three more to save!" Urzog says as he leaves the desert and makes his way all the way across the continent to the Land of Water. Urzog hires a ferry and gets it to take him to an island to the North of the mainland of the Land of water, one where only two people would be found.
<br><br>
After arriving at the base of the island, Urzog makes his way up the long staircase which leads to a small domicile nestled there between two tall trees. Urzog walks up to the house and knocks on the door. "Coming!" He hears from inside the building. The voices that called out to him were to females, whom he knew to be called Uriah Hyoumon and Amara Houseki. Urzog's paws both had an Orb in them. As the door opens he reaches out to press one of them against whomever opened the door but found that he couldn't move.
<br><br>
"You can stop right their Daemon." He hears from behind him. Urzog's head is freed from the high pressure acting on his body. He turns around a bit and sees a young woman with Purple Eyes standing there, her right hand was held out and she was obviously trembling ever so much. "You're not the first one to come here trying to cause trouble." She says as the woman at the door snaps her right hand, summoning a barbed whip into her grasp.
<br><br>
Urzog's mind becomes sort of fuzzy a the pressure on his body continues to increase. "Look Amara, he's got little gems like you! Maybe they're your clan members!" The girl with purple eyes cries out as she steps forwards and reaches for one of the Orbs within Urzog's paw.
<br><br>
"Uriah DON'T!" Amara yells out, but it's too late. Uriah's right hand makes contact with one of the Orbs and she screams out before turning into a shower of sparks. Amara's right hand immediately shots out as she knew the gravity acting upon Urzog would stop. Her whip smacks his left paw and knocks the Orb flying across the grass. "What did you do to my Uriah!?" She roars as she swings the whip several times, smacking the feline across the face and body.
<br><br>
Urzog groans and yelps in pain. "N-nothing! She is only freed from her physical form! She is saved from the pain of being a survivor!" He yells out while running away from Amara and hiding behind one of the trees.
<br><br>
The woman's eyes bulge out in anger. "DIIIEEEE!" She roars with anger as she brings her hands up and releases a massive amount of chakra in a burst of energy that rips through the air between her and beast. The energy rips through the tree and destroys it, turning it into nothing but splinters. Urzog is knocked across the ground and groans as Amara stands over him. "Any last words Daemon?" She asks rhetorically.
<br><br>
"Henkan: Multi-Clear Skies." He says as a half dozen orbs suddenlly spawn all around Amara surrounding her. They quickly move in towards her. In a moment of realization Amara launches towards Urzog. She places her right hand on the being's left arm, a small sealing formula appears under his fur on his skin.
<br><br>
"I'll see you soon Uri-Chan.." She says before being bombarded by the Orbs. She bursts into a cascade of bright sparks. The five failing Orbs dissappear in small bursts of energy. 
<br><br>
Urzog picks up the two orbs of Amara and Uriah. "You don't know it, but you are happy now." He says as he places them both on two sconces sitting inside of the house. "Time to find Zu-" He begins to say before he literally bloops out of existence.
<br><br>
Urzog reappears standing in a dark cave. His eyes quickly adjust to the low-light conditions. Standing in front of him was a woman with six Orbs floating in the air around her. "So Daemon, it would seem you've taken my friends..." She says simply. The woman standing before Urzog was rather aged compared to the other six. "And I assume you were about to make your way here to get me...Good for you that Amara put the mark on you." The old woman says while staring at Urzog.
<br><br>
The cat Daemon stares at the woman. "Zura the White, your speciality is Fuuinjutsu. By Mark I assume you mean the Mark of Summoning." He says nodding his head. "I'm so glad I didn't have to look for you! Are you ready?" The Daemon says as he reaches out towards Zura. 
<br><br>
"You can stop that now." Zura remarks simply. "You're not going to be sealing me away as you did the others until you've shown me the basis of this technique of yours." She says staring at him rather stoically. Urzog looks sort of shocked.
<br><br>
"W-woman! You cannot learn to use the Spheres of the Clear Skies!" He yells while shaking his paws at her. "You are just a human!" He yells.
<br><br>
Zura chuckles. "Then explain why I have the six Orbs of my friends." She says to Urzog as she leans against the wall of the cave behind her. Urzog was rather shocked. He hadn't realized that that's what the woman had floating around her.
<br><br>
"I-I don't know! How do you have them!?" He exclaims while shaking more.
<br><br>
"I'll tell you. It's because your little technique is flawed...Beautiful, but flawed." She begins to explain. "You really are just taking your victim's physical form and sealing their essence into these here orbs, but...In doing so you aren't taking anything away from them. They are still here, their essence, their personalities, their experiences." She says while smiling faintly. "My Seals." She says finitely.
<br><br>
Urzog begins to quake with anger and fear. "YOU HUMAN! I JUST WANTED TO HELP YOU!" He exclaims as several dozen of the Orbs appear all around him. 
<br><br>
"Relax child." Zura says as she snaps her right hand. The giant sealing formula that she had prepared upon the ground glows with a bright white light. The Orbs floating in the air are quickly sealed away into the ground. "You see, I can rather easily shut you down." She says simply. "Now, you're going to give up your secrets one way or another." She says angrily.
<br><br>
"I won't tell you anything!" Urzog yells as he dashes at Zura.
<br><br>
"Very well my friend." She says with another snap. A formula which was inscribed within the outer formula which had gone of previously begins to glow with a blue light. Urzog begins to feel something tugging at his very essence. "I'll see you later my friend." She says as he is dragged down and sealed deep within the ground. Zura sighs as she walks over to the wall. She creates a string of handseals before placing her hand on the wall. Seven indents appear on the wall in a circular pattern.
<br><br>
"When again the Seven are returned, Urzog will be released." She says as she walks out of the cave. "For now, I'll work on figuring out these little orbs of his." Zura Dorukyo walks along the beach south of Amegakure on her way towards her home to the North of the village.
